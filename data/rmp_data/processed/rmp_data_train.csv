"Lectures are tedious and seem completely unnecessary, yet are the main focus of the class for some reason. The lab is fine, but instructions are often unclear and I found myself coming in outside of class far more often than any other I've had. It is hard to understand him at times and this makes communication a struggle.",0
"A jolly nerdy fellow. He's a little strange, but does a great job teaching the topic. Assignments, labs and lectures are very organized. Very pleased with the course.",1
"Mr. Hoover's 1020 was great. He's very patient, and will go over the material until you understand it. Always gives extra credit for the exams. He also goes over most of the homework. There's no reason to fail his class.",1
"Would very highly recommend. If you have the chance, TAKE HER! Her lectures/class are very structured and gives end of chapter problems that give you a huge hint on what to expect for exams. Exams are super straightforward.",1
Good person has a passion for music however the class was pretty hard to pass.  If your not into jazz and cant dedicate enough time to listen to it daily you wont do well on the exams. The exams are hard and on top of that they are only 12 to 19 questions so it harder to pass.  Lectures have nothing to do with exam. Reminder this is for MUS108*,0
"If you're looking for an easy A, this is it. Just don't miss too many classes or he drops you/ you won't know when assignments are due. No tests at all with only a few assignments, just do them and turn them in and you'll get an A. Lets you leave early almost every class and you watch movies frequently.",1
"This is hands down the worst professor I have ever taken a class with. Please heed my advice and don't listen to the other reviews and get fooled like I did. Maybe at one time Jeff was a good teacher, but now, I wouldn't even call him a teacher because he does. not. teach. He drones on about irrelevant things & tells people their OPINIONS are wrong",0
"The vast majority of students seem to like Professor Russell, but for whatever my opinion counts, I feel that she lacks to proper knowledge to teach her classes. She consistently makes rather large factual mistakes and often teaches directly out of the textbooks; I would have learned more if I just read the books and never showed up to class.",0
"Jerome is a great teacher, everything is online and gives you 2 chances on everything. If you do the homework you will get an easy A. The best Calc teacher Ive ever had. He teaches business Calculus and knows his stuff! Very integrated teacher and respects everyone. If you struggle with math you need to take Mr. Caldwells class!",1
Professor Marlowe was one of the best professors I've had. She goes out of her way to help you and help you do very well in her course. There are many opportunities she gives for points in class. She makes lectures very understandable and study guides were a great help prior to each exam. I would take her again if I had to. She is a must take!,1
This professor needs to take responsibility and quit teaching at CSULA. No student should suffer with their grade and learning because of this guy.  Albert didn't  grade anything until finals week and doesn't bother to reply to student emails.  Midterm and Final was 10x harder than the homeworks and made students suffer. 1/10 worst  professor ever.,0
This class is very difficult. 30 seconds to answer a question on lab exams so its basically you know it or you don't. She's really hard on the students and makes the excuse that if we want to go to the medical field you need to be able to do well under pressure. I would say this class messes with you mental health.,0
"Very entertaining lectures. Light journal work throughout the semester, few tests, and only one presentation. Would highly recommend.",1
"Terrible, terrible, terrible.  The woman is completely pointless.  Why is she employed here at all?",0
"Take this class if you dare.  It was a horrible class, I would not recommend anyone take her class.  Not only does she give out more homework than is possible to finish (especially if you have a family to take care of) but she expects you to know everything and is not willing to go out of her way to help you understand.   Very disappointed in her",0
"pretty easy, tests straight from book, participate in forums and will do fine. more involved in this class than evsp411. the 2 assignments are pretty easy if you just follow directions and use references provided. I think this is easy A",1
"This class was so much fun. We got to get actual studio time and got to practice using the cameras, being director, etc. Very hands on class and so much fun! Felt very confident when making my own productions for class. Very enthusiastic! and helpful",1
"Loved being in her class! The group assignments during class are helpful towards your speech and she cares about your progress. Very helpful when you're having trouble with any part of your speech. Highly recommend taking her for speech, she made speech class so comfortable to be in even when we're online :)",1
"Unbeleivalbe how he can be a teacher. Absolutely incomprehensible lectures. He likes to make the students feel stupid when they ask questions. The guy has to realize that we're there to learn the subject; that's why we're asking questions. Never in my life had I been subject to a more useless, confusing-for-the-sake-of-cunfusing teacher in my life.",0
"Generally a very sweet woman. When it comes down to ANT, she's passionate and because she's the chair of ANT, she's pretty serious about her work. Weekly assignments and LOTS of reading from textbook and multiple articles every week. Not a lot of slideshows, mostly lectures. I like her, but I don't like the extensive curriculum. Tough class to pass",1
"ethics of education is sooo boring. she is very monotone and unclear. the tests are ridiculous (and i went to class and studied). the readings are ambigious and very boring. the only fun part of the class is going to teach at the school. and that's mostly bc dr. wike isn't talking. she's very smart, just boring.avoid if possible",0
"Prof. Nielsen is amazing! She is kind, sweet and empathy! She always supports students!",1
"He is hands down the best teacher i have had at this college. So happy to of met and learned from him and will continue to take his class for my art appreciation, and any other art classes that he offers.",1
"will teach yourself, hates to break prob down, shell be annoyed but be sure to ask all the questions, vague teaching, shes lazy & uses a math app for hw & grading & because of this she wont know how a student is doing on their own, the midterm/final is in class & must show work this is when shell know if u can work problem but still wont care",0
"Having prof. Current online was honestly a really bad experience. I dreaded this class and its outdated materials and lectures - I was bored out of my mind most days. Assignments were pointless or confusing, as was the Canvas page. Most frustratingly, he showed an unwillingness to listen to the concerns and ideas of students. I'm so glad to be done",0
"His Philosophy of Science class is tough material, but he's a great guy and very nice. Majority of class is discussion, and there are only papers for assignments so if you do bad on those you're screwed. He's very willing to help though. I'd take a course with him again for sure",1
Dreaded this class everyday that i had it. Couldn't wait to be done. This teacher takes alot of pleasure out of insulting kids on thier work and pointing out thier mistakes. He emails you late at night and gives you 50 pages of crap to read for a quiz the next day. Dont think he's an awful guy but dont take this if not serious about graphic design,0
I had him for recitation...he's so boring!  He just rambles on and on..maybe he'll be better in anthropology since it's his topic..,0
"Oh Sheryl, where do I begin? If you've had her, you're ready for what this class entails. However, if you haven't, get ready to be open to criticism. Papers turned into her will come back with tons of ink marks and suggestions. However, her suggestions often reflect old AP style teachings. She changes her mind and criteria a lot as well so listen.",0
He's a really good professor but he's a little confusing at times. He tells you to write what you feel is right but then tells you how he thinks you should've felt. He's not good at explaining stuff so if you're not really into English take him if you want to get by. But if you want to really learn how to write essays no.,0
This man is so energetic and passionate about Bioengineering that it will most certainly be wonderful! This guy is undoubtedly one of my favorite professors in the department and really does care!,1
he talks a lot with topics that not related to the lecture.,0
Kept things interesting as much as possible.  A lot of reading and pretty boring reading at that.  Reading the textbook is a must.,1
was this a class or how to follow directions? First of all if you miss one question on the hw she doesn't give you credit also if you take out your phone you have to leave for the day and cant take the test or quiz. there is like a test everyday I didn't really end up learning a lot you have to buy like 8 books I would not take her again. ,1
"Not present during any of the lectures, very hands off, didn't really provide any support. When I was struggling, I was told to try and rely on outside sources aside from lectures and the book. Single assignments would end up taking 4-5 hours because none of it was thoroughly explained in the lectures. Midterm and Final had questions not covered.",0
"For me personally, I came in already fascinated with the topic of French History & Culture so the class was pretty enjoyable. Sometimes the homework and tests could be a little too difficult and time-consuming though. I thought the end of the semester cooking project asked way too much for a Gen Ed course. But overall decent instructor.",1
If you wanna have no life outside of microbiology go for it. Tests every week with questions that are tricky af and will make you question all of your study habits. If you are taking any other class that has the potential of being at a difficulty level of above 2 do not take this teacher!,0
"This is the single worst class I've attended at JHU, virtually or otherwise. Here is everything you need to know. In response to COVID, the professors chose to make this class asynchronous. This is useful for reviewing material. However, the problem that arises when you have an asynchronous class with no grades other than exams, is that students",0
"OK professor. This class was very easy, but his attempt to teach/help was never sufficient enough. My classmates always seemed frustrated to follow and he'll mock you if you didn't understand. I didn't need to attend his class to pass his tests b/c I felt like the textbook was much more helpful! I'd say it's only mandatory to turn in hw/for tests.",0
rude to students calls us stupid and lazy by saying all we do is play on our phones. tests are unbearably tough and half the things on the test he never talks about in class. Whenever u ask questions he rolls his eyes won answer them because apparently he told you about it before. I could go on and on about him! If you see him as your teacher RUN!!,0
"Moved to online courses and he did not adjust material at all, actually had more work to begin with. Constantly ignored emails and uploaded materials late. The class became more work than all my other courses combined. Spent 7 hours on one exam that he said would take 2 hours max. Worst professor at wcu and hoping to get him removed",0
"Horrible Psych experience. As a PSY major, I wanted to learn from interesting reads + classmates. Instead it's ALL text book and extremely difficult gradng. Tests are 100 M.C ?'s very hard stuff. WOULD NOT REC. Not a good Psych professor at all.",0
"James Richards is one of my favorite professors so far. Makes his lectures fun and engaging. A few assignments each week, but he's more than willing to help with them and answer any questions. Made accounting fun!",1
Tough grader,0
"Clear instructions, simple weekly discussion posts, easy assignments, and three online exams. There is a lot of material given as a resource and the book is definitely handy (most of the discussions/assignments come from the book). Overall, clearcut online course that gets you an easy A. She is also helpful with email questions and grades fair.",1
I really don't like his class. Too much work for an introductory-level class. The final Essary requires you to find your own objects from 3000BC -1600AD (you need to secure the object when you are only halfway in the class). There are huge problems with the teaching style and hard to communicate. Doesn't care about his student. For online courses.,0
"FSE100 is an easy class on its own, as there are no tests, but Muhlian sure does make it quite unenjoyable. He is very bad at explaining what happens during lab, and oftentimes the whole class (including the TAs) are confused about what we're supposed to be doing. During lecture, he's also confusing and not very engaging .",0
"I took a class with him at UFV, and I see students from SFU and KPU have the same opinion. Changing schools has not changed his teaching style. Good Luck trying to get him to respond to emails. I'm still waiting for a response from ;6 weeks ago. I would NOT recommend his class. For a first year course, he expects too much",0
"He's very new to teaching & it shows. He's VERY difficult to understand & has an extremely hard time with being wrong & being called out on it. He's absolutely brilliant, but clearly not meant for teaching. I'm majoring in chem, so I didn't have a hard time w/ the class, but I read the entire book & ignored his lectures. Thats the only way to pass.",0
"Assigns on average 8 hours of homework per week for a 2 credit course, and just rescheduled an exam to the day before it was supposed to happen, with 2 hours of notice.",0
"Best professor I've ever had. Made learning really fun, and made me laugh a lot. I was always interested in going to class every day, plus he was an easy grader.",1
"This professor would pick on specific people. There was one girl in my class who she would be extremely negative towards. She would make fun of her when she wasn't in class, tell her her ideas for projects were terrible with no constructive criticism. She lacked a professional attitude and she seemed to lack compassion for her students.",0
"He is a nice guy.. but professor wise, I would never recommend him. His class is passable. But, you will learn nothing. He just reads off the powerpoints and seems disinterested in any comments from others. However, his exams are easy if you study. His exam reviews are very helpful. I wish he was that helpful in daily lectures.",0
"Worst class ever, respect yourself and choose a different professor",0
"Amazing teacher,  easy A for Prob & Stat. Very funny and it might take the whole class to explain one problem but that means no homework",1
"Dr. Simms will make Geology very exciting. You will enjoy his lab projects, especially if you team up with motivated students, and you must be motivated. He does not follow the text book, and you must take notes when he is lecturing or you will do poorly on the exams. He is humorous and highly intelligent, and you will learn alot about our Earth.",1
"I totally agree with all the responses...just dont do it. the tests and projects arent hard BUT going to class is a must and that is the HARDEST part, trust me... waste of your time",0
"Old school... in the sense that class is confusing and there is very little structure or elaboration if you are struggling with something. Really terrific guy, but his class just went right over my head despite great effort.",0
"This guy's pretty boring and isn't very good at teaching. He flies through chapters but highlights what's going to be on the final for the most part. If you want to do well, you're gonna have to study a lot on your own. The textbook is your best friend but he definitely isn't!",0
Fantastic Professor.,1
"Easy class, but he is rude to students. Doesn't answer questions well, and is very short with students. If you are confused, good luck.",0
"As a person, she is very sweet and thoughtful. My only complaint is her grading. I really don't mind putting in effort but after a whole quarter I still couldn't figure out what she wanted. I would go off her suggestions and still get points deducted. Very frustrating. ",1
"At first I didn't think that this class would be hard, I was wrong. 81 percent failed his class. He has a quiz every Friday. All short answers, you must be specific or they get marked wrong and spelling HAS to be correct. The test are ALL short answers too. You if plan on taking him make sure you study, and know all the material weeks before.",0
very nice professor.  he sets up conferences when you write your essays to work with you to make your paper better.  he is always willing to help and answer questions.,1
"Dont get me wrong this prof is very sweet & kind but she is a very hard marker! Make sure you show up to lecture & do your readings or you wont pass. She also has her favourites that she tends to be more lienent with. She canceled a class, and didnt lecture us on those chapters too which sucked. She was an okay prof but I wouldnt take her again",0
"This class is a lot of work, but pretty much what one would expect going into learning a whole new language. If you want to learn Arabic, you cant go wrong with Miss Tabur. So far I have loved this class. She doesnt mind reviewing the material with me during her office hours. She is funny and she also smiles a lot, which I find endearing.",1
"I could not stand this class. I found it to be annoying since I signed up for an in-person class and got a hybrid class. The lectures were boring, people would sign in and leave. It was frustrating because her class was all based on MindTap. I would not recommend anyone to take her just because her class is a waste of time and money.",0
I do not know where to begun because this teachers thinks shes a math god but she really is not good at teaching math at all. She gives you more than 100 math problems per week for homework where like other math teachers I had taken pass gives less than 60 math homework problems. Really a rude teacher that sleeps in class and can't teach.,0
Overall a great professor who knows his stuff. If you are a visual learner he might be a little lecture heavy for you. He is always willing to help as long as you do your job as student and follow the rules.,1
"The man is all over the place!  I've had instructors before that you can tell they feel it's beneath them to be forced to teach at a community college level.  I get that vibe from him.  Condescending.  His quizzes are easy if you listen to 10% of what he says.  The rest of it is just talking to hear himself talk, I think.",0
"Gives ok notes and examples are mostly from the book. If you can learn by yourself, then you don't need to go to lecture. exams are like homework/in class examples but are still different. did a little below averages for midterms not sure about the final and ended up with a C with the curve.",1
I strongly recommend NOT taking him. He is one of the most inflexible professors I've ever had. He preached all semester about how open minded he is and how he is willing to work with you but its all just facade. He calls people out in class for not talking but then bashes your opinion when you do. He's just straight up rude.,0
No Comments,1
"Lisa is one of the most amazing professors I have ever had, she really cares about all of her students work and wants to get to know everyone in her classes. She was very caring and understanding and the way she taught class always kept people intrigued. She is funny and incredibly smart and I would recommend her for any English class.",1
"Nurick is the GOAT. He's a Bentley legend, been here since the 80's. I loved this man's class - very fair grader, not too stressful and he's so accessible outside of class. I loved going to his office and just talking with him about life. Overall, my favorite professor at Bentley. If you have the chance to take him, you'd be foolish not to.",1
"He really knows his stuff and his lectures are very clear. He assigns classwork that really helps prepare you for the tests. If you don't understand something, don't be afraid to ask him for help. He's very approachable and willing to help. For whatever reason, his teaching methods really clicked with me. I highly recommend his classes.",1
You will hate this class. Whether you like it by the end or not is up to you though I guess. Weekly he will assign 5-8 journal articles that span from 15-50ish pages long that take forever to read There are two exams and he gives you two essay weeks for and a term paper and a book report/presentation. He rambles. Far from easy but I hear most pass,1
Professor Pajer was super awesome! She is very sweet and really just wants you to become a better writer. Your grade consists of 5 essays over the semester and a couple of writing process assignments for each essay. She loves helping students 1-on-1. She explains very clearly what she wants you to write for each essay. AWESOME freshman teacher!,1
"I wouldn't recommend taking this class with her if you have little background in stats. She assumes the class knows more than they actually do, so she tends to skip many steps when doing problems. She won't take responsibility for the class doing poorly (My class had a 62 average for exam 1 and said ""it wasn't her fault"")",0
"Such a great prof. Knew the material and how to explain it pretty well. Start your PAs EARLY. I recommend putting effort into your project plan and following it. Schedule your assignments for this class. Koh had some funny stories at times, though the end was a bit rushed. Wish we could've learned RB trees and hashing a bit better.",1
"Like the others said, he's loud and opinionated.  He doesn't give students a chance to speak their opinions and if he does, he counterattacks.  His class overall is simple with 2 essay questions and 50 multiple choice.  If you don't mind rude teachers that are offensive then take him.",0
LOVED HER! I'm taking her for spanish 102 for the summer. Such a sweet woman. The class is VERY doable and she definitely wants everyone to do well! She will help with any questions you have and very helpful in general. I personally loved her. It's not the easiest class in the world but if you can put the time in definitely take her she's the best!,1
"Jeri is amazing! She made me feel at home as a transfer student and helped me find a direction I wanted to take my art! I wish I had more classes with her, because she is one of the only one in the art department who will actually sit down with you and help you through things. Super fun lady as well! She has a sheep farm and a puppy she loves.",1
I've learned alot from him with his real world experience. Never a dull moment in his class. Only wish I could of had a chance to work with him.,1
I learned a lot from her and she is the best english professor a student could have. She tells you exactly what she wants from you. Great professor.,1
He is a very nice teacher and his class is easy to understand. There is no homework and the class is based off test that you take.His test are very confusing because he does not really clairify what he wants you to write on the test.,0
"What I liked about Professor Mayne is that she consistently provided feedback, and applied her knowledge and wisdom to her perspective on the case studies and analysis of basic employment law. It is necessary to read in order to understand the course thoroughly. Her organization and guidance made the course successful.",1
"Paper heavy class, only a couple of exams. You have to work with your group to run an experiment and write a manuscript on it. No attendance but a lot of in class assignments for a lot of points. miss one and your grade drops. Very nice and funny.",1
"Awful teacher! Rude, unprofessional, & completely uninterested in teaching this class. No wonder people don't enter the field of sp. ed! Dresses in tacky attire. Does not teach, prefers to read from ppts. Makes Ben Stein sound like an awesome public speaker. Yes, her voice is THAT bad! Not clear in assignment expectations. HCC should be ashamed!!!",0
"The last two reviews hit the nail right on the head. Lectures can be 4 hours long sometimes, and the time allotted to finish tests/quizzes is unreasonable. I don't believe this Professor would flunk anyone, which is the only good thing, but I would NEVER take a class like this again.",0
"The kindest professor, truly cares about her students learning and understanding concepts. What you learn from this class will help you tremendously in other classes where you have to write and research.",1
"Take this class and you'll be sorry. He pulls up the book online, throws it up on the projector, and reads directly out of it for the whole class period. While he's doing that he explains how the book is meant for mathematicians, not students. His grading system seems completely random and will give you 0 on a question almost randomly. Do not take.",0
Just don't take her. I would wait a year to take the class with some other teacher. She's pretty bad. ,0
"Dr. Teekell is extremely passive aggressive. She sounds really nice but her comments are quite rude in class. If you are sensitive I would not take her class. She assigns lots of reading and says that she realizes her students are overwhelmed and burdened by the amount of reading, then assigns more. It feels very insensitive when she wants grace.",0
"An Honours Thesis with Dr. Rich provided a challenging opportunity which was enriched through regular meetings with her lab composed of graduate students and post-docs. Dr. Rich is a very fair marker who clearly presents the grading rubric and expectations. If you are diligent and work hard, an A+ is easily obtainable.",1
"If you show him you care and try, he will help you out with the material and with your grade. His lectures are funny and he usually doesn't bore you or make you stay longer than you need to.",1
Good guy. Very cool and makes sure that you enjoy class time. Class was not all that difficult. I would take TJ again.,1
"Discrimination, no science only politics! Hater of many ethnicities, including Russian people. Hater of some religious. He was disrespectful even to his wife during the class. The worse person I have ever meet. He is not a scientist because his mind is full of political propaganda!",0
I took Alisa for math 108 and from the very beginning found her very hard to stay interested.  She was very monitone.  She also rarely worked problems on the board unless asked.  I went from 2 prior classes with an A to having to withdraw from her class.  I would NEVER recommend her to anyone.  She is super nice though but that's all I can say.,0
You're better off taking this class with a different professor. Expect her to tell you that you should focus on her class and ignore your other classes.,0
She is an AWESOME teacher.. makes class fun and ineresting!! Easy and FUN!!!,1
The professor can be disorganized but she's very understanding. It's not hard to get an A as long as you do the labs and she drops the lowest quiz grade. There's a lot of reading but she summarizes them in lectures and she was lenient with handing in labs late. She's genuinely caring and her dog is really cute.,1
"it seems like you have aton of assignments, but dont worry, you can revise all of them as many times as you want before the final portfolio. if you placed directly into this course you will do great. if you did good in high school writing, you will do just fine in here. do your work and you will do fine!",1
"I made an A+ in this class - all quizzes and exams are online and are T/F, however, Prof. Frazier is very rude and has snarky comments. He is very harsh on attendance and says it counts for a grade yet actually doesnt. If you can manage his weird teaching ways its an easy A class.",0
"Neva is one of the best teachers I've had so far. Her attention to detail and knowledge of great academic writing made her an endless amount of knowledge. My writing and active reading improved immensely over the course of the quarter. She does have high expectations, and yes it's a challenging class. But worth it!",1
"Worst professor Ive ever had. The only thing done in class is are easy examples and then its home to do 3-9 objectives (9-27 questions) that only about 3 are similar to whats done in class. Mentions tutoring available but for those students who work at night, theres barely time to complete homework let alone tutoring. Lots of pop quizzes.",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FOR CARIBBEAN BIODIVERSITY!!!!! Class grade only dependent on 3 exam grades out of 4 (1 is a cumulative final). The average grade for the last exam was a low D without the curve. He asks questions that are very specific about something he said during a lecture that he barely mentioned. Very unorganized way of teaching.,0
"Very easy to follow his notes as he writes on the board. Unlike other math professors, he takes he's time and you won't need to ask him to slow down. He has written text books in the past, and it shows through his teaching methods. He even shows compassion for his students.",1
"Hard, but I actually learned something",1
"She is very fair, very easy grader. She gets a bad rap because of her accent, but it is nothing that you can't understand as long as you pay attention.",1
Weird guy.  Grades hard.  Boring lectures.  Guy's a total slacker.  Avoid if you can.,0
"One of the worst professors I've taken. Mocked students who ""should've learned the material in grade school"" and was often unwilling to explain calculations in class. Cancelled Friday classes without making up for the time lost and seemed perpetually unhappy. Tests were 2-3 problems and significantly different from homework and lecture problems.",0
Great Guy. Memorized everyones name. Great reading material. ,1
"One of the worst professors I've ever had. Hutton didn't respect any students in the class, as well as she responded to 1 out of 9 emails I send throughout the semester. Also, hutton believes all of her students should ""look up to her"" and become just like her. She accused me of cheating twice and argued with my class the entire semester.",0
"I had this prof. for Spring of 2020 and he very difficult to reach through email. He was very confusing, and unhelpful. Unless you had previous background in it like I did, you will most likely struggle. I had to guide quite a few students through the material. Some were promised regrades but did not get a response at all towards the last few days",0
"Professor Russell is the best professor at Vandy, in my opinion. I would recommend any of her classes to anyone interested in political science or law. She's really funny and knows everything there is to know about Constitutional Law. She is always willing to help students and it a really great person to talk to about legal careers.",1
"3 assignments due thru the semester building on a personal website. Assignments pretty easy... a midterm & a final. tests consist of like 25 multiple choice q's & HTML coding part. The coding part is easy, but the multiple choice questions are the toughest part of the tests. i made A's on all assignments n C's on tests. My final grade was a B.",1
His teaching is just terrible. I pay good money for this class just to sit in here and be confused for 2 hours. His accent inhibits him from giving understandable lectures and he gets an attitude when you ask him to repeat himself. DO NOT TAKE HIM. EVER!!!!!,0
Our semester completely fell apart due to COVID. How do you reach a professor who never responds and is never on campus? Dr. Wigginton does not respond to emails or voicemails. Her expectations are unclear and she enjoys taking points off for reasons not provided in advance. Just plain rude.,0
This rating has been removed as per our site guidelines.,1
"Three papers, but he is unhelpful when you ask for advice. He will grade lower on papers written on subjects he doesn't like, so write about the assigned books if you want to get an A. He is unclear with his instructions and he mumbles a lot during class. His lectures are irrelevant and unhelpful in class. Hard class/grader, not recommended.",0
"Her note taking style is impossible to follow, she doesn't accept outside perspectives for the most part, and is a harsh grader who gives minimal feedback.",0
Very hard to understand. Changes direction with her speech so much you cant follow her. Also grades alot harder after drop date.,0
"The 6 Observational Events might take you out of your comfort zone, other than that it is pretty easy to get an A. This is a Hybrid class. You meet two times in the beginning of the quarter, and all the resources to complete the assignments are available on Blackboard. Ask him for help. He's always available (via Email) if you need help hit'em up.",1
"She has done an extremely poor job of handling the pandemic, and has shown complete disregard for students' digital safety and privacy. When I brought this up with her, she basically told me ""if you don't like it, drop the class"" which is an extremely inappropriate response. 3 1/2 years at UBC and I've never felt so disrespected by a prof.",0
"He was very helpful whenvever you need help at office hours. Online quizes were great. If you do bad on one, you can make it up on the next. His tests have more than 50% of the problems from the homework. The final has a lot of problems that were right from the in class test. Buy the solutions manual to do the homework- it is definitly worth it!",1
The lectures were actually pointless for this class. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE TEXTBOOK!!! I learned all the stats I know from the textbook not him.,0
I though Terri was a very caring and considerate instructor. If you had any problems with canvas or not understanding homework questions she was available and approachable. We used an e-book text book which came with great study tools. She is understanding and has a passion for education. Put in the work and you will get good marks.,1
Took her class a couple semesters ago. Really excited to hear she is teaching math 121. Unfortunately I will be unable to attend this class because the location does not work for me. Very caring teacher.,1
"Mr. DeVries is extremely boring! His tests are unbelievably long and hard! He tests on things not even covered in class. He doesn't lecture on the subject matter, but gets off on tons of rabbit trails! His clothes are messy and he is extremely disorganized! Don't take! Wait for another instructor!",0
"Johnson is very opinionated. Her opinions are clear on whats right and wrong, the class isnt based on truth, its based on her own moral objections of right and wrong. At one point she even threatened that if we didnt like it, we could take sociology with the other instructor who shared and would also voice the same opinions.",0
I wish i knew about this website before taking his class. I recommend not taking this class unless you're looking for failure.,0
The lectures are heavy and that is only because he takes the time out to go over homework(one of three things that will determine your grade). He is funny and open. I liked the class alot. The homework and exams are online. But he does care and wants you to understand the work.,1
"offers a max of 5min office hours. timed quizzes, hw doesnt match the youtube videos he post on weekly canvas, so your own your own relying on classmates for help for all hw cuz he is extremely unreliable and terrible. awful, dont recommend at all unless u dont mind learning on ur own and spending hours asking classmates for help",0
"So far, Sanda is the greatest professor I've had in this program. I had her for GD1 and it there definitely was a learning curve when getting used to her tough love style of teaching, but after a while all of things she asks you to do make sense. Sanda truly helped me evolve as a designer and I'm so grateful for the time I got to spend in her class",1
"One of the most interesting classes I've ever taken. Gets theoretical/philosophical at times, but I would highly recommend all pre-health students consider taking it. There are quite a lot of readings and they are pretty necessary to do well in discussion/papers/exams, so expect to devote a good amount of time to the class.",1
"There were discussion boards and chap. tests which were stupid! He'd take one tiny thing from the book and make it a test Q., instead of asking a question about a concept. I didn't like how he structured the tests, but if you have the book w/you, there's no need to read the chap. beforehand 'cuz you can just take the test w/out reading the chap.",0
"Oooh. Snappy snapy, piccy piccy. Wha's with all the devoloper? Develping your fil m and printing it is not what you can do, either at home, or not. You know. I'ts a good class but HARD because of the pictures, and also because you're have to print it.",1
"He is a tough teacher who at the beginning tells you what exactly he is expecting you to do to actually pass the course. The wording of his tests are advanced. If you're  in for the challenge go on ahead, but besides that I would suggest you to find another teacher. In order to get some points at the end you have to speak up and answer questions.",0
"awful directions, expects everyone to care about art even when none of us are art majors and that we should just leave because we were wasting his time, told me today that he may have thrown my paper away because there is another kid in the class with the same last name and that made it confusing. 70% of grade is in the final week.",0
"Super great professor. Class is tough, he expects a lot from you, but it's doable. He makes lectures fun and exciting and really draws you in whether you're a history person or not. I loved his class and plan on taking another with him.",1
"The textbook and the lecture are word for word the same. Completely and utterly useless. The lectures are SOO long for no apparent reason, but the content itself is interesting. The way it takes forever to make notes, and her tests are based on fine details rather than the general topics. -11/10 would not recommend!",0
Such a great  professor! The material is very insightful. He really breaks down the readings for you in his lectures. Definitely ask questions and participate in discussion. You get quizzed every class but if you just do the readings you will be fine. There is so much extra credit at the end of the semester it would be hard to not pass with an A.,1
"Handouts are the study material for exams.  Field trips are a BLAST - you HAVE to love field trips to take ANY course with him.  Sample questions often show up on the exams.  Study, read, participate and ENJOY.",1
This class is pretty dumb but she is a good instructor to have. Listen to her lectures and you will succeed on the exams.,1
"Worst teacher! I took him for A&P 1. Its hard to understand him at first but eventually you pick up what he's saying. Yes, his homework is unlimited but he gives you like 70 questions, each question has 15+ parts. Gives you a review of 200 questions a week before exam and expects you to know them all for 150 question test.",0
"She was a very nice woman but definitely bad at teaching. Her lectures are all powerpoints which she basically just reads off of and posts them, but she takes attendance. She gives extra credit and has weekly homework but they aren't hard. Also gives study guides for exams that are so long. Exams were harder than expected though.",0
All tests are online.  He drops the lowest test so if you do good on the first 6 then you don't have to take the last or go to class.,1
No Comments,1
Okay let's begin. 1. She uploads the notes (if you're lucky... up to a week after they were covered in class) but without the pictures which she tests you on. 2. Not one soul on the planet can memorize every archaeological site in the world to put it on a map! 3. can't hear you! 4. memorize ALL of your notes for exams or you're screwed!!!!,0
"The sweetest lady you'll meet. I love her freshman experience class!! She brings in guest speakers, cares about her students, and is an overall wonderful woman. If you get the chance take her! She is an absolute blessing!",1
"It's a hard class if you're just taking this for your science requirement, but he's a really great professor and wants his students to do well. He allows re-takes of exams if you do really bad, and is always ready to help you outside of class. His class on labs is easier than the actual class though. I'd definitely recommend him.",1
He makes class fun. ,1
Professor Druffel is really caring and wants everyone to pass. The lectures were asynchronous (and split up into sections with mini quizzes at the end) and homework was a weekly quiz with around 20 questions. She was eager for students to show up to office hours and the tests were open notes. I definitely recommend this class.,1
I really wanted to enjoy this class. Phelps is very opinionated and constantly contradicts what's in the book and DVDs. He will start lecturing about material in test 4 before you've even taken test 3. He is overly critical of the ONE PAGE writing assignments and is known to berade the class before passing out the graded essays. Very disappointed,0
I have taken him for microbiology twice. He has improved so much. I was worried at first but i am so glad i took his class. He is a great guy! Show up to lecture and study. You will do fine.,1
"3 exams, and a map quiz. Theres an app you have to purchase about $25 where you do you're homework and where she takes attendance on she also does mini quizzes during lecture so don't miss class. Her lectures are heavy and will put you to sleep. She does seem passionate about history though and theres extra credit.",0
"Ms. Forth is a great prof to listen to. She engages her audience through the use of technology. Also she is a fair marker, having all exams (two mid terms and a final) in a multiple choice format. I would highly recommend this prof for this course",1
"Prof. Spiczak is really smart, but is a terrible professor. His clicker quizzes don't really help you learn the material, and doesn't mention material that is all over the tests. You definitely need to read all the chapters and go over lecture PP's twice.  Also, he seems really nervous and seems to be staring at the back wall rather than students.",0
"Professor Gilbert is brilliant, friendly, approachable, and incredibly incredibly attractive. I love everything about him and how dedicated he is to the material he teaches. Don't take this class with anyone else!!",1
great teacher,1
Miserable time. Felt invisible. Eventually had to drop the class after she upset me.,0
"He might be the worst person to gain the privilege of earning a Ph.D. This dude is so unorganized its unreal, he doesn't know what time his class is. Do not take him if you are a student that enjoys structure and a stable course schedulethe worst class I've taken in 4 years.",0
Takes forever to grade things and takes FOREVER to respond to emails. The layout of the course is super confusing. I got an A from literally writing all the study guide on tiny index card for midterm and final. The rest of the stuff I did mostly copy pasted stuff on Google. Text is difficult to understand and totally useless. Don't take if you can.,0
"Lori was a mess of a professor. Rude, arrogant, and all over the place quite honestly. The class taught themselves each chapter every week and she completely could care less about the stuff being taught. As a matter of fact - she never taught once. Also, twice a week meeting class only met once a week, forcing tighter deadlines.",0
"DURING COVID Prof Wu was very clear from the start with his syllabus. We only had 2 test (mid term and final) and a project that you work on the whole semester and turn it in at the end. Does have a heavy accent, but he tells you exactly what to do for your projects and powerpoints had all the answers for the quizzes so study those. Great class!",1
"Kai Du is very hard to understand, and his teaching style is ridiculous. During class he'll write a few short-hand notes on the chalk board (even though there are 6 sliding dry erase boards available) and proceed to try to explain the information, which you probably wont understand, and so you MUST read and study the text book every night. GoodLuck",0
"Very good professor, makes everything clear, and goes out of his way to ensure you understand the material.  Says class attendance is mandatory but not enforced but you'll miss critical material 3 tests, 3 HW assignments, no quizzes, possible to cram in the last week w/out reading, only if you attend all in all, best Econ professor, take this class",1
You should not take HUMAN101 as an online course because you will not have enough time to absorb the material covered. La-turner had no problem letting the students know that he did not like teaching this class online. I think if I had of physically attended the lectures I would've enjoyed it.,0
"This is the worst History professor that I have met so far! she thinks that her class is the only one that we take during the semester, and make you read a lot for every single class. Avoid her at any cost!!",0
"Easy.  But frustratingly, irritatingly, infuriatingly, mind-bogglingly inane classes.  If you seek to learn, do not look here.",0
"an earlier post said ""run for your life""  you can't, she is the only one teaching this class. she may be belittling if ask a question during office hours. This will be one of the instructors who will be in your ONE OF THE WORST lists. I think she found the WRONG occupation, but despite the years of Poor Student E-Vals, she has the same job?",0
she is great,1
"Even though I didnt do as well as I had hoped, dobrin was helpful and great in the class",1
STAY AWAY! The school may as well throw a statistics book at you and expect you to learn math by reading the book because thats what he does. He refuses to help students even when i asked for help finding a tutor he said he knew of none,0
"Professor Liu is an extremely tough grader. The reading assignments are  long and difficult to understand at times, but this class really broadens your knowledge on the complexities of restoration ecology. The tests are much harder than they need to be, extremely specific. Overall, not terrible, but she makes you work for your grade. ",0
"He is an alright teacher, giving it was his first time teaching here. Exams were a bit tricky to me, but I probably just haven't studied it extremely well. Covers a lot of material in this class. His writing on his notes is bad, but legible to an extent. Do well in your lab reports and you will do fine in this class. ",0
HE IS SUPER!!!!!!,1
"Take his class if you want challenge. He knows his thing but he is a tough grader, he grades every single homework and didn't accept the only late homework that I accidentally forget to do. Tests are hard and didn't give partial credits on tests so I screwed up really badly. (could get a B with partial credit but get a D) try to avoid him.",0
"Three hours of her going over everything you learned in lecture. Not a lot of hand on stuff, mainly just listening to her talk and not understand any of it. Young more tech savvy version of Palitinus.",0
"Mr. S is a great lecturer, even as just a grad student. I have never heard of anybody having a problem with him personally, and I found him to be respectful and unbiased during class. Whoever wrote the review below is a complete and utter moron. It is sad that a person like that is able to gain admission to SLU.",1
"She's sweet, but I cannot understand her for the life of me. I've tried attending the lectures and she has online lecture recordings but her English is terrible. She's not good at explaining. To do well on the exams you HAVE to KNOW the book front and back and do the online modules and hw. No one did well on her exams, the test averages were awful",0
"In the beginning you think what a great teacher...then he grades analytical essays that he makes you do all semester. He has very opinionated views and grading system. This shouldn't be a history class, more like a essay competition class to make him jump out of his seat but that won't happen b/c he thinks everyone sucks at writing except himself.",0
"She is a good teacher but the material can be boring at times. It is somewhat difficult too grasp some concepts but she does a good job of explaining things throughly. Do the study guides for the exams because if you know that, the test is the exact same. The homework is graded based on accuracy but it is easy. Do not forget to do online quizzes.",1
She moves way too fast but she does give the opportunity to ask questions. I studied hours for each test and I couldnt get an A in this class. She takes points off for everything. She gives study guides but her test questions are different than the study guides and her expectations are always unclear. Shell find any reason to take off points,0
"I thought the course was fair. It wasn't like most Comm courses, and he made lectures funny. I liked him. PS. Don't buy a textbook for this course.",1
"Mr. Tyson is my favorite instructor so far at MSU and I'm a sophomore. I took PLS 101 for a gen ed and loved it because of Tyson. He is hilarious and teaches his information clearly and will go above and beyond to give examples and really make sure you understand it. There aren't many tests, no papers, or homework assignments. TAKE HIM! :)",1
You get about 8 quizzes but he chooses your best 3 for your grades. Grades on a curve at the end of the semester. I barely showed up and passed with a C. A little more effort and I could have actually gotten an A. Taking Soc 012 with him next semester.,1
No Comments,0
Great instructor with years of medical field knowledge.,1
"hated her, UNCLEAR, pulls questions on tests out of her you know what. RUN the other way!!!!",0
"Never replies to emails, never clear about assignments, never clear with tests, terrible lecturer",0
"Honestly, I am fairly confident that she wrote all of the positive reviews herself. I am an 'A' student, but I don't know anyone who would speak well of her. She is unclear in her expectations, terrible to communicate with, and doesn't understand student questions at all. I got a decent grade in the class, but I would seriously NEVER take it again.",0
Ms. Aguilar is more of a lecturer so be prepared to listen as soon as you sit down till you leave. She grades pretty difficult in English 1302. Always be there and never skip unless it is an emergency.,0
"Love love love this class, makes me think about who I want to be as an artist and Jeri is just so great at helping you achieve that goal! Can't wait to have her for future classes. Love her! ",1
"She's a very nice and easy teacher. Just do all the assignments on time and participate in the class group discussions, I bet you will get an A for sure. You can email her to ask when you have questions. Hard to find her in her office, usually she doesn't have office hours. I recommend take her class if you are an ESL student.",1
Very helpful compared to other AP professors!,1
"Steve is a great guy for culture heritage, I had him for 1 & 2, he truly cares about his students and wants you to succeed. He has high expectations for you, but he just wants the best for you. There is a decent amount of reading, but usually it is interesting. A lot of group stuff, usually discussions. No final exam, test or quizzes. Just papers.",1
"He got phone calls in the middle of class almost every time. He would ignore your questions. His TA didn't know how to complete most the HW questions. Would go through examples in class that had nothing to do with the HW. He seemed out of breath most days. But I guess he knows R pretty well, if that is what makes you a good teacher.",0
AWESOME PROFESSOR!! He is amazing!  He teaches with such clarity and helps you to understand Microbiology without any fears.  He makes sure that you understand the material and makes you appreciate the course without it just being a required course. I wish the rest of his students would give reviews because he is a GEM! I wish hetaught more courses,1
"She cares a lot about her students passing and always gives you chances to boost your grade up. Lectures were confusing but I think that was more because of the material. You definitely need to study to pass. I enjoyed having her as my professor, she is very nice!",1
Good professor and more than fair. Discussions are clear but you have to pay attention. What you get out of this class depends on what youre willing to put in,1
"Lynn talks excruciatingly slowly and the lectures are painful. She grades homework so harshly for absolutely no reason and doesn't explain things well AT ALL. I would rather drop out of college than take this class again. She made me cry on the first day and if you like yourself at all, don't take her class. You will fail.",0
"Professor Schap will hold you well over the time period every single, showing a blatant lack of respect for students as individuals outside of his class. He also decided to send us links to YouTube videos halfway through the semester and watched those instead of class. I payed a lot of money to watch random YouTube videos. Frustrating.",0
Awful grader. Even if you got every answer right she can still take points off  for millions of reasons. She made a lot of mistakes in class but she wants you to be accurate as a machine in the meantime. In order to get a perfect score you have to split hairs on every question even if it has nothing to do with math.,0
"His exams have nothing to do with whether you learned the material or not. He simply takes small details from photographs and picture captions and tests your memory, of 8 CHAPTERS AT A TIME!",0
Take this class to get credit for a plan letter knowing we signed up for a introduction class. Then he says if you have a brain youll get b or better and talks politics half the time. He grades and talks to us like this is a class in my major and I will be taking religion for the next 3 years. Hes got to understand were taking it for a letter.,0
"This class was the only class that I'd look forward in the morning. As a freshmen, I thought that I wouldn't be ready for this course but man, she's hilarious and super caring. Homework? Barely any. Her lectures are very fun and most of them relate to the world today. She always bring laughter to the class, it's truly an amazing class.",1
"Highly suggest for her Freshman Experience Class, she tells you what you need to know without an excessive amount of work.",1
"she goes off topic a lot, makes it hard to pay attention and understand her",0
"The study guides are basically the tests. You must go to class to get majority of the answers to the study guides. There are 5 exams. There are 2 papers. That is it. There are no guidelines to the papers, which makes it hard to write and she destroys the papers. If you like women in history, take her!",0
"She might have been having an off semester, but could have given some more feedback. Feedback was pretty sporadic. Assignment due dates were mostly unclear or changed at the last minute. Useless syllabus. Project instructions were vague, which may have encouraged creativity, but definitely inspired frustration. Probably needs to improve rapport.",0
"Gives notes out in class already printed off along with practice notes for you to work on. Goes over everything in class with you and has reviews before the test. Great teacher, advise going to class because you can get extra credit and is much more helpful if you are there. Makes Econ actually very interesting and fun.",1
"Do NOT take this class. He is very inconsistent and unfair. He gives pop quizzes multiple times a week and they are very different from the tests. He assigns up to 5 worksheets for homework a night. Granted it is easy math however sometimes It is very time consuming. Overall, he thinks hes never wrong and is very hard to work with.",0
"He is definitely my favorite biol prof! I enjoyed his lectures for BIOL126 and he is very approachable outside of class. His exam could be tricky, but you will be fine if you review his powerpoint carefully.",1
"Mr. K was fantastic! You can tell he is passionate about art, drawing, and composition. His lectures are filled with rich descriptions of textures or moods to inspire us as we draw. His feedback is thoughtful, honest, and encouraging. If you are someone who's just there for the grade and you don't care about the spirit of art, he may annoy you.",1
"Very helpful, if you tell him you want to pass the class he will make sure you do. You need to show that you are trying and he will work with you. I failed this class before and with him I received a B. I attended every class and did all work but I actually learned.",1
Span 315 with Profesora Hess was a great class. She is very knowledgeable & also very funny & nice. She's also helpful during office hours or after class if you have any questions. Highly recommend her. ,1
"This professor likes to point out the ""appalling propaganda"" from movies and groups that promote conservative ideas like capitalism... but fails to include analysis of propaganda from the liberal political ideologies. Sure she's inspiring - if you like being spoon fed political indoctrination.",0
"Wilson gets a bad rep for being vague and very confusing, which is definitely true. Her class was definitely interesting and in my opinion valuable. To be successful in this class just participate in class, do all of the assigned work, go to her office hours (she's really nice), and work well with your group. Tests are super easy.",0
"Personally I felt the course was a bit unorganized and formatted in an usual way. There is a lot of reading and the course is broken down into multiple assignments. If you put in the effort, it's possible to get a good grade in this class, it can just start to feel dragged out pretty quickly.",0
Hes very dry but funny. actually enjoyed class. If you show up you will pass,0
Avoid at all costs. Asks for work far beyond what is listed in the syllabus.  Very vague in directions and then grades you on things you could not have known. Requires 2-3 copies of all lab reports.,0
Dr. Harris was an amazing professor! He makes the lectures more interesting and the iClicker questions were a lot of helpful in the class. All of the work in the class was online that way it will make things much easier and more time to work on your other classes and still pass the class.,1
Dr. Smith is BY FAR my favorite professor Ive ever had in terms of being inspirational. She definitely made me so excited about education! She is fantastic. This is the second class Ive had with her and I wish I could always have her as a professor!,1
Although he is very kind he is not specific with tests. Most questions will not be on the slideshows he puts on canvas and blames you if you dont succeed in the class. Very disorganized and is unclear of when deadlines and tests are in his class.,0
"My only class out of 5 for the semester that did not adjust to this ongoing, world-wide pandemic. I let her know my work schedule was not consistent due to the virus, and my internet connection was terrible and I was not able to do my work because everyone in my area is home. Work is also due by 8 and not midnight, and assignments almost every day.",0
"He was very unhelpful and doesn't tell you what he expects of the essays. On the first one, I got an A and the second one I got a C. When you ask him for help he disappears. Apparently, medievalists are very busy living in their parent's basements doing jack****.",0
"Not only is she very clear about everything (assignments, lectures, etc.), she is a really funny, entertaining teacher.",1
"Lots of people like him because he is funny, but frankly I think he is just a lazy drunk, didn't grade any hw till the very end, never saw the correct answers so know I got things wrong, no way to know why or how to fix.",0
Terrible teacher and calls out students.,0
"Professor Wheeler makes lecture enjoyable and interesting. I believe the class is way too hard for a 100 level so if you are looking for an easy GenEd, this isn't the one for you. A ton of reading outside of class. Befriend your TA for sure.",0
Dr. Field is the BEST professor at UNL. Tom is a very unique guy who really cares for the students in his courses. He really wants to cultivate a great future for everyone. His classes are very fun and exciting to attend. All information is very practical and relatable for the REAL world. Take as many classes with him as possible. Hes a GREAT guy!,1
"Have to buy textbook and access to another platform which was kind of annoying. Reading the textbook is important as all quizzes and exams are based off it. She's approachable, accessible and really nice and held review sessions before each quiz. Gave lots of opportunities for people to ask questions, although course was hard would recommend her.",1
aw. thinking back to this course i could cry. that class was so traumatic like destroyed my 4.0 and the one class i think is genuinely impossible to get an A in unless you live and breathe astronomy. It's sooooo bad you have to do like hours of reading then have a quiz every class that has nothing to do with the reading and he does not care,0
Very hard to understant do to her accent.  Class was taught at a graduate level over our heads.  Did not like answering questions.,0
Shes a VERY HARD teacher shes horrible she never helps you when you need the help she expects you to know how to do the work take someone else who will help you.,0
"This was the professor that helped me decide that I wanted to go into the sciences. I love his class so much I am taking him again next semester. Go to class, form a relationship and be genuine and you guys will get along great! I've learned so much from him. His tests are pretty tough, but he also can grade easy if you have concerns. Funny too!",1
"boring class, but easy grades. very repetitive and i really didn't learn anything new at all. good professor, just boring teaching style.",1
"Nice guy, but I lost count the amount of times I almost fell asleep in this guy's lectures. Talks too fast, and goes through slides like lightning fast. Goes so fast we all have to take pictures of the slides since he doesn't post the solutions to the questions. Also his quiz and exam questions are WAY TOO HARD, ended up failing the final.",0
"I know its the pandemic, but he hasn't taught half of the year and moved the due dates or cancelled half of the work for this class. I was hoping to learn something in this class but feel this was a complete waste of my time. Take him if you want an easy A without having to work for it.",0
Dr. McLaughlin is a nice guy but the critical thinking class is useless in my opinion. He assigns 8 homework assignments that are worth next to nothing point wise. He expects you to participate in class daily & deducts points if you dont. The midterm was decent but the final was ridiculously stupid and worth 35 points of your grade. Never had a C!,1
Many students in our class opted to not attend lectures and study the textbook on their own. Dr. Sander reads directly off of her slides which can be difficult to follow. She offers bonus assignments and group quizzes to augment your grade. 2 midterms - the last 10 minutes of which were spent in a group setting. She is helpful during office hours.,0
"Very nice man, but this class was awful. He assigned YouTube videos instead of teaching and yet gave the hardest exams and homework I have ever had to do. Questions were unclear and made to trick you. He takes off an unnecessary amount of points for small errors. In office hours he is not helpful and says that it is for you to figure out. Run!!",0
Worst class and professor I've had so far at VSU. The concepts are easy but he makes his tests unnecessarily hard! Not willing to meet with you if it isn't during his office hours. He's very smart but isn't good at teaching the material. Take another professor!,0
Her test were way to hard and had tricky wording. Her study guides were not the best either so that was no help. Wouldn't recommend her if you have a busy schedule!,0
Worst professor I have ever had!,0
"Her course is simple- readings that lead to homework, which lead to tests. Lots of reading but honestly you can just just skim the reading. Tests are all short answer and extended response. Overall if you like theology, not a bad course. If not, I would recommend perhaps another course because you might just fall asleep every single day (i.e. me).",1
"Absolutely amazing teacher. Has an infectious laugh and adorable personality. We always laughed so much in that class. You get the feeling she really cares about her students and wants us to do well. She challenges you, but only to bring out the best in you. I just loved being in her class.",1
Great teacher and really takes interest in her students. Workload is managable and she is a fair grader. There were a few writing assignments and quizzes and a discussion question each week. There was also a Proctored exam. You won't regret taking this class.,1
"Absolutely one of my favorite professors. His lectures are very entertaining? But it's very important to attend the lectures and take good notes because you won't pass otherwise. Also, do your readings!! Your grade will suffer if you don't. There's only 4 tests and those are your only grades.",1
"Look, organic chemistry is hard. But MS is a solid choice. He is hilarious and tells stories in class which honestly helped me engage more and pay attention. Orgo is hard, but if you put in the work you will do well. Downside to his class is that tests ARE THE ONLY GRADE. There is a large curve though. I took him during COVID-19 and he was generous",1
"She makes this class really hard, but if you ask for help outside of class it will help. She moves too quickly through material, her accent makes her hard to understand, and she doesn't answer questions in class well. There are graded clicker questions each class. There is a semester long group project. Definitely suggest going to office hours.",0
Professor Walker is a nice guy who cares about his students and tries to get to know you on a personal level. He tends to go off topic a lot and lose track of time a lot however. Most of the time class is spent talking about random things going on in the world today than actual learning. If you want an easy A this is the class to be in.,1
"350 characters is simply not enough for me to explain all of the reasons NOT to have Stephen Connor as your professor. Please save yourself hours of studying, attending his lectures with hopes of learning, and the tears of getting an awful undeserved mark. If you can wait a semester to get another prof, please do it. Just trust me.",0
"His English is not that good and he can't really explain well, he mostly reads from the slides and the lectures are sooooo boring!!",0
Not helpful at all. Will tell you to rewrite everything! But the narrative books are interesting.,0
(online summer) He is a very nice guy but I feel like the exams were harder than the actual problems that we were given in Mastering Physics. Heard both good and bad things about him but more recently heard to take Physics 2 with him because he has quizzes and exams that are straight forward.,1
Her Teaching ability is very pathetic,0
"Great professor, everything is clear! 3 online open book exams with study guides! Easy-A, he also does some discussion posts but very few. All the lectures were great, and available online as well, which was like being in class. He checks if people see the lecture, it is 10% of the grade. Caring gives extra credit. Take Him!",1
just don't do it,0
"Overall, I would say that he is a decent teacher. My downfall in the class was attendance. You do receive an attendance grade and trust me when I say it will affect your final grade. I would've had an A if I would've came to class more often. Sometimes he will get off topic, but he has a good sense of humor.",1
"Difficult class.  A majority of that was due to Dr. Wilson's inability to actually teach.  Assignments, etc were moving targets.  I altered study habits w/ each section to see which would bring the most success.  The amount of time that I spent studying for this class did not coincide with my final grade and overall effort.  2/3 of class dropped.",0
"SF STATE, had him for Stats. It was his first time teaching the subject so he was just getting the hang of things which is completely understandable. Very chill guy. Exams based on lecture and/or homework questions. Can be a bit difficult to understand him as he confuses himself at times, but is willing to answer questions for clarification!",1
"Very bad professor. Explains things without detail, expects you to understand the first time as if you already know the material beforehand. Extremely disrespectful to students during class (won't let you use the bathroom, condescending if you don't understand, etc.). Random pop quizzes and random homework checks can make or break your grade.",0
"Ugh, I literally didn't learn one thing in this class, I barely even remember taking it. It was online and there where barely any assignments. The test where hard because there was no lectures to go over it was all based of off text he told you to read which was very long and boring. He seemed like a nice guy through emails though.",1
"Quizzes and test do not test over lecture content. The online format is very difficult to navigate. Three-Four quizzes per unit, four or more activities per unit, and, one exam per unit. This totals to over 15 quizzes and approximately seven exams, with over forty activities.  Also, a midterm and final. Excessive work load, in one's opinion.",0
Extremely rude and doesn't help you if you ask. Tells you that you did an assignment wrong without telling you specifically what you missed.,0
"Great Class, Professor Birnbaum definitely knows forensics.  The papers were not difficult (for graduate level) and he is generous enough with the grade.  There is one test, the final, just make sure that you have been doing the readings or it will bite you.  The grade of your previous assignments can carry you though.  Would take again.    ",1
"Excellent lecturer, very personable and flexible with deadlines if you put in a real effort.",1
Way too much work and reading for a 200 level class. He expects his students to do way more work than should be expected for a class at this level. He is very opinionated & seems to make personal vendettas against students who voice opposing thoughts. Anyone who thinks for themselves rather than just saying what the professor wants should stay away,0
Although his jokes are lame and he tends to give facts/side notes about mathematicians he makes the class understandable. He gives plenty of time to do the hw and ask questions on the hw. Knows what he's talking about and wants you to understand too. HW assigned basically every class but not a lot of quizzes/tests and no final. Take his class :D,1
Just memorize random facts from his book and you will do fine on the exams - if you have sharp memorization skills. There's actually little to no actual learning about NUTRITION in this class. It's basically Biochemistry 2.0. I am disappointed because the instructor failed at articulating the material in lectures. Just memorize his book.,0
"everyone seems to be complaining about her, but she really isn't that bad. Class got cancelled half the time but we still had to assignments from home that were due at the time class was normally over. Those are easy because you can work with a friend. so just have a smart friend in the class. you don't need the book, but you need the course reader",1
Professor Walling was an amazing professor. He cares very deeply about his students and is willing to help them out when needed. Just be prepared for plenty of reading and a whole class lecture.,1
"professor rombo is horrible, lecture slides have no information on them so if you miss one class you wont know what was going on that day. gives 3 tests including the final. ridiculously hard grader when it came to projects and assignments, she wont tell you what she wants but then will fail you if you dont magically give her exactly what she wants",0
"The only homework you have is the questions in the book. They are due on the vocab quiz day. Please go over those vocab words by the way. She teaches a lot about the different words used in different countries and dialects. Helped a lot with my speaking. 3 individual presentations, 1 group project and the final. Overall, not a bad teacher to have!",1
"Very time restricted exams online, has habit of not unlocking assignments on time",0
Dr. Jon visit class in China and have the deep thought and fun activity for our learning.  He is very nice man and good teacher.,1
Very intense. Amazing gaining. High risk of A minus.,1
"Martin is not a good prof, he glances over important topics and goes in deep detail of things that should not be covered in the course(Like putting Riemann integrals on a midterm, this is not MATH 261). His practice problems he posts are terrible half of them are applied topics which you don't need to know. Get ready to teach yourself some math.",0
"Great professor. You definitely have to do the assignments. Homework and quizzes every week. It took a little to get use to,but it wasn't long. You get to comment on your own personal thoughts, which is nice. There is one paper due towards the end of the semester. Really glad I had Professor Smith for this class.",1
"This course heavily relies on participation. As long as you are doing your work, you will be just fine! I would wait until after class begins to buy the books that he requires though, because you only dive into one or two out of the bunch. However, the others are interesting reads if you are someone who likes a good book.",1
"Dr. Britton is one of the absolute best teachers I've ever had. Her lectures were engaging and interesting, and a lot of that has to do with her excitement about the subject. If you attend lectures and discussion, read the book, and study for tests you can get an A fairly easily. I miss her class already- she's absolutely brilliant. ",1
"Mr. Burt would just read off the slides. He doesnt give a straight answer to any questions whether it be regarding course content or grading. In labs, he only gives about 15 minutes to do them them and spends most of it trying to set it up. He curves at the end of class, so you dont really know what youre going to make until the very end.",0
I almost fail this class even I read whole textbook. very difficult. Not recommend,0
"He uses a ""flipped classroom,"" so basically, you are paying $4,500 to teach yourself the entire course and then have him grade your tests. He has a thick accent so his lectures are a little difficult to understand, and they're SUPER boring, but he's a nice guy and will provide help if you need it.",0
I loved Professor Mack! She is entertaining and really cares for her students. Semester long group project and discussions every week so don't skip class. Tests are not too difficult if you study the information from each chapter. Definitely one of my favorite teachers at CofC.,1
I WISH HE WAS TEACHING FOR THE SUMMER TERM BEACUSE I LOVE HIM!! I AM IN HIS CLASS NOW AND IT WENT BY QUICK!! WE USED OUR TESTBOOKS MAYBE 3 TIMES THE WHOLE SEMESTER!! HE TEACHES FROM SLIDE SHOWS AND IS VERY NICE ABOUT MAKE UPS AND TURNING IN ALL WORK..HE MAKES STUDY GUIDES AND WHATS ON THERE IS ON THE TEST(HELLO!!)..I RECOMMEND HIM TO ANYONE!!,1
DON'T TAKE HIM!!!! Unless you wanna fail... Lots of studying outside the class for the exam since the explanation in the class is not that useful... although I attended all his classes and recorded the lecture on my phone to make sure not to miss anything and studied really hard for the exam I still got a C with a lot of hard work...,0
She is the greatest spanish professor i've ever had.  Extremely helpful and enthusiastic.  Will get you interested in material even if you never thought it possible.  Take her if you ever get the chance!! She's great!,1
Very unclear about anything.  Handed back assignments 4 weeks after we turned them in.  Makes me want to vomit everytime I am in that class.  By far the most uninspiring teacher I have had.  I have learned something in the class...shes the model of what not to be when you teach.,0
"She's very knowledgeable, but somewhere across her career shes saw $ signs instead of actually teaching. She's the head of pace's bsn program, adjunct at Columbia, works at a law firm, works here and there, she does short cuts with her kaltora videos. She doesn't teach, its reflections on rotations, if she gets paid thats all she cares about",0
"Take notes and you'll do well on the quizzes. only gives about 3. for the papers, work hard because he is a hard grader. very nice and wants you to learn and understand what he is teaching.",1
"Professor Veliz was my introduction to Computer Science, and it was a great one! He really helped me develop my skills and encaouraged me to be involved in more activities. He is really good at explaining, and accesible outside of class. His grading is also very clear and he is alwasy willing to help. If you can, take him! You will learn a lot :D",1
Great teacher. Helped throughout the course. Had extreme anxiety about speaking in public going into the course. She made it much more relaxed and the course layout couldn't have been any better.,1
"If you want to keep a healthy state of mind, stay away from him. he expect you to know everything. in class very easy examples to solve, on the test, nothing similar to the lecture.",0
"she is the best professor I meet. she helps me a lot and encourages me to be better. if you study hard in her class, of course you could get A and receive a lot of knowledge.",1
Currently taking her summer online trig. class. Best decision I could have made on a summer course. Her material is organized & easy to follow. The homework is easy to understand and we get 2 attempts on quizzes. On exams we can take a note card with formulas. Do homework and you will pass the quizzes. Would definitely take again,1
BEST PROFESSOR AT CSN! Enthusiastic and passionate about what he teaches. Great class.,1
Pretty much just talks about himself for 3 hours. Very boring class but I would recommend you bring other homework and it can become a very nice study time. Study his study guides and you will be fine. Only 3 tests make up your grade.,1
GREAT teacher. Torts can be a bit confusing so you must not fall behind. Start memorizing early on as he expects you to know every rule & policy verbatim or you will NOT get credit on his exams. Study his model answers & follow his suggested formating! You will be expected to know every detail of a case so don't skimp on briefs. You stand to brief!,1
Wow what an amazing class. Not! The longest most boring thing youll ever do. This course is like watching paint dry and you get just about as much information from both. Professor Thompson shouldve retired 20 years ago. He will mumble on forever reading power points that have nothing to do with the actual tests. failure in action.,0
"He was the best professor I have ever had. I learned so much from his example of a good person, and great teacher. Thanks to him I am a better counselor.",1
"Professor Debbage is wonderful, very helpful",1
"He is a caring and easy professor, just do what he asks without complaining and he will respect you, and you'll have a good time.",1
"I found her very unhelpful and unapproachable. The few times I interacted with her she was very unpleasant to deal with, and never fully answered my questions. She is clearly passionate about what she is teaching, but lacking the teaching skills. Would not recommend taking this class.",0
"Has an accent, but while it is easy to discern what words are coming out of his mouth, it is impossible to understand what he is talking about. He spends every lecture covering the board in equations and theorems that will never be used on any problems and does not explain what they do. After the first test the class becomes impossible do not take.",0
"Devey doesn't seem to be able to apply the educational principals he is teaching. Though i was well prepared, i barely survived the first exam- got an A, but scrambled to understand the questions. When I tried to contact the prof he ignored my emails and discussion board posts, and doesn't hold office hours. This class was a major bummer.",0
"Great class, great professor, responds quick and works with you. Definitely take this class..",1
"If you want a job in journalism, take this class and talk with Marty regularly.  She will teach you the things you need to know to succeed as a journalist...and she will work her butt off if you are one of her best students and show a real effort.",1
she is a great teacher very helpful.,1
I took her course online for a minim-ester and it was very easy. The homework and quizzes were very easy and she gives enough time to do. Easy A if you everything as she says. We did not use book. Definitely Recommend!,1
Here is all you need to know. He is NOT a good teacher and will not respond to emails or calls. He WILL give you the TEST as a study guide the week before. You are dumb if you don't get an A in this class.,0
"Covers the basics well, but the class is really easy using some logic and common sense.",1
I would never in my life take this class again.. If you don't write your papers in his writing style then you can best believe you're not going to get a good grade in this class. He's rude and I did not find his lectures to be interesting. I would never in my life recommend this class to anyone... even if there aren't any other classes available.,0
He is a great professor!!He teaches you about the reality of life. His stories were amazing and his exams were mostly from his power points. He get's the class involved and ask you questions that makes you think twice about what you can do to make a difference in your field.It is impossible to not get an A in his class.,1
Had her for Workplace Communications. She is the best. I am passing her classs with flying colors! (:,1
"This was an online course. Fawcett was not quick to grade but was very respectful and grades easy. He guides but does not micro-manage class, just leaves you alone. I loved that he didn't require a lot of discussion board entries. He was understanding for extenuating circumstances.",1
He's really chill. All his classes are fun and everyone learns in his class.,1
"Very nice, she knows a lot and if you're struggling let her know so that she can help you. Make sure to check moodle and turn in packets even if she doesn't bring them up.",1
She gives so much homework that takes a lot of time for little points. She is also a very hard grader. My roommate turned in all the parts separately because there was no template and the professor gave her a 0. Her lectures also are long and boring. Her instructions aren't clear and docs points because her instructions aren't clear.,0
"Professor Cramer only gives out about two museum paper assignments and 2-3 exams, which are non-cumulative. He has his own website that lists all the works and terms you need to study for, but you still need to take good notes to succeed on his exams. He rewards active participation and improvement too, and is an all-around excellent professor.",1
"She is a nice person but I found her ineffective as a prof. Very confusing, as she seems to go in circles with her explanations and will never give you a straight forward answer. I highly recommend the textbook as that is the only way I learnt anything, I taught myself the entire lecture. She was defensive when I voiced my confusion. Unapproachable",0
"A dope professor and is really understanding. Gives good reviews that reflects the test perfectly. She gives out extra credit and extensions if you need it. 10/10, cant complain.",1
His voice is super boring.  He does not teach you anything and reads off PowerPoints you could read yourself. The real grades in the class are based on SAM (online program for computer class).  Just do the trainings and do well on the quizzes and exams then you're get an A. Also contribute to your group project. ATTENDANCE MANDATORY! ,0
"This is one of the best kinds of graduate school professors: the kind that will challenge you, enrich your experience, and provide you with vital tools to move forward. She is not an easy professor and takes hits from no one. But she is empathetic and willing to invest her time in you if you are proactive.",1
"she requires many books that you have to order online because some are not available in book stores. Although i highly recommend to not buy all books she does not even use them, also her syllabus was not clear on her grading, i got a 74 and she gave me a D which dropped my GPA by a lot unfortunately. I thought as all professors a D was 69 or 70",0
"ALI, ALI, ALI, this guy is the real thrilla in Manila, Clear, flexible understanding and fair. He should teach the other Profs at York to be like him.",1
"Mildly passive-aggressive in class, but willing to explain some topics again when asked. Tests are poorly designed (typos, repeated questions & confusing phrasing). Was appointed to instruct my class at the last moment, so not entirely her fault. Generally interested in student learning, though lectures are not always useful.",1
"Moves through material too quickly and will not pause for questions. If you have the courage to ask a question, be ready to be ridiculed for not understanding the concept. By far the worst teacher I've ever had. I made sure to take an onsite class so I would get the most bang for my buck, but I would go home and teach myself online anyway :(",0
She is one the best lecture professors at CSULA but she is brutal when it comes to her tests and assignments. Her tests are multiple choice and rest is scenario questions. She will combine every thing she lectured into one question multiple parts. She does curve but depends on the highest grade in the class. She is very helpful during her office.,0
Worst professor i have EVERRRR had . She does not help you whatsoever. Expects you to know every single thing. On blackboard her power points have atleast 105 slides. EXTREMELY tough grader. Takes of points for the smallest things such as adding a 0 or removing one. Test are weighed ridiculously high. do yourself a favor DONT TAKE HER AT ALLLLLL.,0
"I took this teacher for Statistics at De Anza and it was a rollercoaster to begin with. Constant shouting of ""Stop Talking, You have a question?"" and other little distractions that would get her off topic. Her lectures move at a slow pace and staying focused is hard due to her thick accent. Overall would not take again, nor recommend to anyone.",0
"This prof made me absolutely hate this class. She and our TA miscommunicate on everything. Get ready for the most unorganized class of your life. If you want to be spoken to like a toddler, take this class. Gets mad at people for being on zoom and not in class. Like sorry we're in a pandemic and I don't want to get corona? Extremely insensitive.",0
He explains everything really well and will answer your questions very clearly. Homeworks are harder than actual tests. Difficult concepts at times but it is all very interesting. Would definitely recommend.,1
"Schubert teaches slow enough for everyone to understand and is easily approachable to ask questions. He doesn't use Canvas and at times, he would go on a tangent and talk about his personal life stories; nonetheless, I recommend to take him for Math3!",1
Horrible teacher. she made me want to drop out of college entirely. She lowered my self esteem and I felt very uneasy around her. TAKE KATHY SOHN!!!,0
"Moody Professor, Grades how she desires. Be prepared not to get grade results for weeks. Easy subject made hard!? Doesn't respond to emails, no grade checks ever! ",0
"Very confusing. You only use the notes you take in class for about 4 different extremely difficult tests throughout the semester. They will do you no good on the weekly online quizzes. I thought he was okay as a person and he seems to know his stuff, but hes not a good professor.",0
"Took 4 classes with her within the passed 2 years. Her classes are boring and can be hard to get used to her accent for the first week but after that, no big deal. She's really easy and her classes are straight gpa boosters and I'm not even smart that's why I took 4 classes with her. She's helpful too if you actually go talk to her in her office.",1
"Intelligent. Probably knows a lot about physics. Though, it is too bad he is unable to communicate that to his students. Wish the university would let this dinosaur go. His views are antiquated, and close minded. Which is odd for a science professor.",0
Had the worst experience with this Professor. Had a family emergency but he did not care whatsoever and would not reply to my emails. He will make your life harder than it should be. Lots of work and hes very extra.,0
This professor is willing to explain things and he explains it articulately. Very kind me analytical person. I would definitely take the class again. Not sure the e,1
"With Mme Emond, it's mostly about stats: what are the % for this, for that...  important concepts in sexuality (gender identity, homosexuality...) are not explained with details they deserve and based on psychological processus of the human mind. It's basically memorizing things and throwing them up on your exam. Still, very difficult to get A.",0
"Dr. Callaway is a very kind woman, but as a professor she can feel a little removed and intimidating. Her class is sort of dry and uninteresting. The readings are not long but are constant. A VERY VERY HARSH grader, on papers and exams. I personally think the class is not worth taking, but she is worth getting to know. ",0
"Does not read discussion boards, so unsure as to how the grading works",0
Doesn't grade or give feedback on the many lengthy assignments till weeks later.,0
"4 people in our class of 32 passed Professor Konya's Calculus 1 class. I understand that this is not an easy subject, but when 8% of the class receives passing grades it is no longer about how the students are failing to understand the concepts, but rather about how the teacher is failing to teach.",0
"Hybrid class: Do online work & go to class, even if you feel you dont need to, GO TO CLAS -lectures are tough to understand -examples dont make since! -I would def. take into consideration before taking him if math is your weak spot. Hard to tell if he actually cares to see his students succeed! -Utilize tutors & study groups for sure!!",0
He goes to fast and it's hard to follow. He seems more like an honors math teacher than remedial. Only take him if you are good at math.  He gets really intense when he is working on problems on the board. Nice guy ,0
His grading system is extremely frustrating.  He grades harshly with no feedback to give you room for improvement next time.  His grading system is ambiguous  and inconsistent.  The works studied are borderline X-Rated.  He specifically tells you not to use any outside research.  You must accept only his interpretation of the material.,0
"Not what I expected in a Children's Literature class. The work assigned was not hard just too much. It was hard to follow her syllabus as it was not updated to the textbook required for the class. This professor was the worst at grading, and forget about getting a response back if you had any questions. I do not recommend taking her class online.",0
"I enjoyed his class, hes very clear on explaining the material and brakes every topic piece by piece for a better understanding, he does give 3 quizzes and alot of reading is required, MUST STUDY KEY TERMS they will definitely be on test. Hes also very funny. American politics is a hard class but with his teaching i passed with a B.",1
"Monika was so disorganized. The course structure was all over the place and so last minute. 90% of students in French112 were taking for language requirements - we don't want to be doing presentations in French, we just want to pass the class! Terrible, UBC needs to reassess language requirements.. ",0
"Professor Peters is great at explaining everything and doesn't rush through things. its easy to ask her questions as she responds very well, she does not respond to emails at all. my advise it to NOT miss class",1
"All topics discussed were extremely detailed & unorganized, covering far too much than what should be expected of students immediately entering the MBA program. I would not recommend Jagpal for students starting their core MBA classes. This nontraditional prof does not give graded work throughout the semester: participation & a final only.",0
"She knows a lot about this topic. I advise everyone to take this class due to the algorithms taught are real life stuff. Start coding early and ask her for explanations. She cannot write code well. It reminds me of a CS102 student. Besides that, cool class.",1
"Very ambiguous grading and takes off points like crazy on exams. Spits formulas on the board with little to no explanation. Can't clearly answers questions and responds with ""you should know this from a past course"" but almost no one knows. Make sure to copy down the final forms of formulas and try to get past exams to practice b/c he's useless.",0
"As a junior biochemistry major, I've had all A/A- in all my sciences courses until this one. I got a C+ and struggled immensely. I don't blame him entirely.. i hated physics and did not work as hard as I should have but he did not make it easy with his unclear lectures and 5 point multiple choice questions on exams. Def would not recommend.",1
"hello everyone don't take her class it's big mistake laguardia is doing big mistake to keeping her here and letting her teach psychology classes , she have attitude problem .",0
"While obviously brillant by any standards, Nelson should not be teaching freshman composition. Lectures were not helpful and he was never clear about what he wanted in a paper, although he likes classical litterature more then modern stuff. The class was the bane of my existence this year.",0
The professor teaches outdated material and is rather rude at times. I wouldn't recommend taking this class if you can avoid it.,0
"Do the prelabs and do them well because you will need all of your notes during lab. He comes off kind of mean and strict, but he just doesn't want anyone to get hurt in lab. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether or not he's being sarcastic because of the masks for COVID, but he knows his stuff. He has a ton of office hours, USE THEM!",1
Dr.Houston grades unfairly and she is not helpful,0
"1. His slide decks are awful - paragraphs c&p'd, reads directly from, few in-class examples, no excel use, no computer lab classroom 2. Projects were good, but all self-learning, easy grader 3. Final is egregious nonsense. Took full 3h for 30q, and I wasn't alone. Most material not covered, you need to self study book. Take CFA instead.",0
"Taken as a GEP because I like political science. Honestly, I hated it. He might be better for people who are PS majors/minors. Class was nothing more than basic civics and he got off topic telling stories about his lobbying often. The papers are easy but he won't cover the paper topics in class until the week of the paper or sometimes not at all.",1
"Prof. Clausen is AMAZING! She goes out of her way to make sure you understand the material. She hosts outside class review sessions after each topic, take home midterms, and tons of practice questions. Does on call by the seating chart, but not harsh whatsoever-just give good faith effort. She feels like the cool aunt you can go to for help.",1
"Pretty easy, despite the other comments. Yea, he reads from the notes, but that means you'll know what's going to be taught and what's on the test. Don't feel like going to class today? Luckily, you'll still have the notes. He's also really good if you go to his office hours or ask questions in class.",1
GREAT TEACHER! VERY HELPFUL! ALSO KIND. MUY CALIENTE!,1
No Comments,0
I couldn't imagine a more self-congratulatory professor. How could you screw up craft of fiction? Use it as your podium/back-slap/let me tell you about me and the writing process therapy session.,0
"Dr. Stein is amazing. Easily the best professor I have had here at UT. Very engaging lectures, his exams are the basics of the material so he doesn't try to trick you. He is a lot of fun and can be really funny.",1
He is incredibly disorganized. He shows up to class late 3-4 times a semester. He doesn't communicate with the people teaching recitations whatsoever. The exams are graded differently depending upon what section you're in ( F in one section  B in another section). At the end of the year no one respected him and he completely deserved it.,0
she expects too much from an online HISTORY class. like girl it's an 8 week course and you want us to put 4 sources in a discussion... bye. dont take her if u can help it,0
I took her class online. There are a few assignments but are all pretty easy and it's obvious what she's looking for. She's a fair grader who responds to e-mails promptly. I thought the class was easy to get through and decently set up so I did learn a few things. I would recommend her for anyone needing an online class.,1
"I thought I hated ""art music,"" but this class changed my perspective.",1
The work that she expects you to do is reflective of a 400 level course. The depth of questions and speed at which she expects you to finish exams is not something that someone who is just trying to get their associates degree should be worried about. Just take someone else.,0
"Horrible professor, so rude and reads straight from power points, doesn't actually teach. Tests are confusing. Read the anatomy textbook because it's your only chance of passing.",0
"This professor is one of the worst Ive had. Professor Smith has hardly done any of the work herself and leaves it up to her Sophomore TAs without a set grading scale to grade a majority of your assignments. While its and easy A, its if she actually grades your paper in a timely manner. Im still waiting on a huge grade and its been two months.",0
I think she is a good teacher and funny too but she needs to learn to be more respectful of students and more understanding!!,0
"Professor MacCabe is very patient with students who want to learn, but has little patience for disruptive students who try to hijack the class (we all know that one kid). Sometimes the subject material can be a little boring, but bare with it. If you are willing to show that you are actually trying, MacCabe can be the most chill and flexible ever.",1
"You will never find a more caring, passionate, and professional teacher than Matt. He will do his absolute best to help you succeed. A truly rare breed of professor.",1
His exams are fairly predictable but he is a total male chauvanist.  Doesn't think girls have any place in geology... or the world for that matter.  avoid at all costs.  he's been around since the university opened.  hopefully he'll retire soon,0
Only 5 exams total. Lowest score dropped. There is reading that you have to do in order to pass the exams. Great Class!,1
"we are like halfway through unit one and I changed my major. These classes are special and if you miss out, it could be the worst thing that happened to you and you wont even know it. Carters classes are all easy if you read and are into learning ideas as ways to change how you think. Takes attendance and has quizzes but his heart is in it so ok",1
"She is SO unaccessible. She teaches at like 3 different places, doesn't always reply to emails, and has a grad student do ALL of her grading. If you want to feel like you're taking a pointless and difficult class with no teacher, take Oakley. She isn't helpful but still grades harshly. Complete waste of time, do not recommend.",0
excellent teacher and mentor,1
"This was the most disorganized course I have taken. Prof Lai did not teach the material well. He often talked about topics but did not explain the theory or solve any problems. The textbook chosen was also terrible, and did a poor job of explaining topics. He tries to make the course easy by giving lots of hints, but you end learning nothing.",0
"Professor D'Sa is extremely smart in his field. There are two tests; both 25 questions and multiple choice. He is willing to help and will not trick you. He will tell you what is on the Exams, verbatim. He is the ONLY teacher that lets you use a financial calculator! Take advantage of that! Otherwise, formulas are not easy to memorize.",1
Very hard and extremely picky instructor. Student be aware!,0
"Bertram is exactly what to expect if wanting to go to a university, JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND! I did not care for him! Once you figure out his tests and quizzes you will be fine. His tests consist of the types of cells, the physiology of how major concepts work,  and diseases associated with anatomy. HE GIVES Extra Credit that can bring up a letter!",1
"Dr. Wydner was wonderful! Had her for lab & lecture for Gen Bio. She goes over the PPTs, however lecture can get a little boring. Offers a lot of extra credit, and make sure to keep contact with her if you want a career in healthcare, she is the health careers advisor! Her exams are tough so study all point on  the review sheet, it'll help a lot!",1

"If you completely understand something, you will be confused once she explains it. She never finishes a thought, and is completely unclear. She is not too tough in the grading though, but get ready to teach yourself. ",0
he is annoying and doesn't care about anyone opinions,0
He is pretty straight forward professor online. Class was pretty easy but make sure you study for the mid-term and final as they are most of the points for the class. Would recommend him to other classmates.,1
Beware of this professor. He assumes that all his students come from same have same educational qualification and they all have to undergo his FIRE TEST. I knew I will fail his test as he will give you 50 MCQ 0.5 marks each with 5 choices to choose from. Then short answer questions which are as difficult to understand as this professor himself,0
Great teacher! Unfortunately I had to drop but if I hadn't I know I probably would have passed with a high B or an A!,1
I have taken this class twice before and failed it because professors don't know how to lecture. Professor Hercules does a great job explaining the material.,1
"I liked the way he went over the homework in class. If anyone had trouble or had a question, he wrote it on the board & explained it. I also liked how he gave 4 tests during the semester & averaged them for the grade + points for homework. I think it's much easier than just one test at the end & you can see how you are doing before it's too late.",1
"I've never written a review, but I wanted to because she helped me see that law is the path for me. At first I thought she wouldn't be good because of all the bad reviews on here, but its just cuz she's an older lady, with annoying opinions and habits. She really enjoys teaching, is friendly, and most of all passionate about law + women's rights.",1
Good teacher.He knows what he is talking about and he doesn't try and push his views on his students.,1
"This class is straight group activities, group projects, and outside work. Sometimes she chooses to not have class which is AWESOME! This could easily be an online class, as you can pass without studying for anything. The group you are assigned day 1 is the one you stick with for everything, so don't burn bridges. Most pointless and boring class.",0
"I dont know what he is like in person but his online class sucks. He has two sites that for assignments which can be confusing, and no notifications for when he makes a new assignment. For due dates some quizzes don't have a due date while others do which is misleading. Also you don't know if a certain assignment has a due date until it is too late",0
"I took phys 2 with Mr. Burt over the summer. He would get numerous example problems wrong daily and refused to demonstrate the correct way of doing them. He wasnt capable of setting up the labs or answering questions. It was as if he did not even know the subject matter himself. Started out funny, but wasting 4 hrs daily is no laughing matter.",0
"As a person Im sure professor miller is a great dude, but as a teacher. He is so robotic its hard to learn. Before the corona virus, I had an A+ in the class and was able to find the class easy because I had people around me to help. Now during the virus he puts these videos on YouTube (khan academy like) and expect us to learn this. Bad teaching",0
"I found his lectures rushed, disjointed, and unclear. This is partially because his powerpoints are a mixture of the textbook publisher's ppts as well as a few other professors' lecture slides. It was easier and clearer to read the excellent textbook and skip all lectures. That aside, he's helpful out of class and his exams are fair.",0
"He's not a difficult prof. but he sucks at teaching and likes to hear himself talk. He'll go off on tangents that have no real importance to the subjects and its unfortunate he's the only surveying lecture prof. I don't know what he's like in labs, but be prepared to deal with a lot of nonsense in his lectures",0
Very engaging.,1
"asked for help on 2 separate occasions in LL; both times she was excessively rude and clearly annoyed when i dared interrupt whatever she's (always) listening to with her headphones. no idea how she is still employed at ACC, let alone teaching. sour attitude with a superiority complex.",0
"Dr. Schwartz is a great professor. He is tough, but he truly cares about the material. He has review sessions, responds to emails quickly and will help you if you need it. Put in the effort and you will do well. His test care challenging but so Anatomy is a hard class. Be prepared to study a lot.",1
"Professor- mostly serious, dull The class- only guest speakers, boring and long, annoying, heavy group work. On top of this class being pointless, he was not a good professor. Constantly talked about himself and about how he made it through college and complained about his paycheck like theres no tomorrow. Super Easy hw Pointless class but easy A.",0
"Judith can be all over the place, and she is great at what she knows. However, she is an extremely empathetic person, and as long as you're being honest with her, she is understanding. If you try to just get out of things, she will catch on. She is challenging to work with, but she is so respected in the theatre community, it is worth every minute",1
"Shaw is an awful teacher. She might know about dogs, but she is a ridiculous and unfair grader, with unclear expectations. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. I love dogs and she made learning about them unbearable.",0
"Dr. record is a really good prof. He listens to the students concerns and helps a lot. I would love to have him again. Be prepared to do projects without a ton of guidance. You are welcome to ask questions, but also be independent.",1
Math is not my strong point.,0
"she was a really good professor. class wasn't always thrilling, but she was passionate about all of it. she had great stories and graded fairly.  plenty of small papers and 3 take home exams that ruined my life while i was writing them. but if you finish them, she'll give you a good enough grade.  i'd reccommend this section.",1
He is not helpful at all,0
"Extremely rude,Breaks her own rules by being habitually late and constantly contradicts herself. You will NEVER have the correct answer for her. Her lectures are Long and Boring and at the end of them you still haven't learned much. English is my best subject and she has ruined the class for me;with her poor teaching style.",0
"He gets very distracted by everything although he would be a good teacher if he could just stay on track. He also picks favorites quickly, and constantly starts conversations with them while teaching. However, he is very nice and understanding.",1
Tests are rediculous. Cheat sheets dont help because he  has stuff on tests that you have never seen before. Sucks at teaching/and tries to fail everyone,0
Do NOT take his class unless you are looking to be stressed and fail. I am a hardworking student and complete all my assignments yet that doesn't seem to matter. He yells at you or makes a sarcastic remark if you ask a question even when you go to his office hours he makes you feel dumb too. Just do yourself a favor and don't take him!!,0
horrible teacher. ,0
Its a really tough class,1
Dr. Holt is extremely easy.  All you have to do is 15 assignments all year and take open book exams.  The assignments consist of you typing some numbers straight from the book and sending them to him over the internet.  Extremely easy.,1
This course is just for learning the software. ,0
Farzin Irani is a great professor. We did our quizzes and case studies online on mindtap. The quizzes are based directly from the book so you cant go wrong. You will get an A if you put the time into the class. She knows a lot about psychology. ,1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS INSTRUCTOR IF YOU WANT TO GET A GOOD GPA OR GRADE! He brags about failing students during class. Attendance is mandatory and they fail you without hesitation even if you have a doctors note. Although they teach a freshman level class, their grading scale is very harsh and they expect students to know everything about painting",0
Awful,0
acosta was an okay teacher but moves to fast,0
"Dr Chang teaches Probability Theory in a way that is plug chug. Does not go over the meaning of the topics in this course. Only shows how to compute Problems. The book chosen is a great book (Degroot), however, it can be hard to read at times. Due to Chang's teaching style, the proper book was not chosen. I will not be taking any courses with Chang",0
Absolutely Horrible. Treats it like it's highschool. Rarely answers questions. Won't help you with anything in excel. Doesn't work with students. Leaves grading up to other people. Blinks too much and her only child is cat...Stay away from rankin if you value your G.P.A,0
Horrible class structure and the professor is a bit crazy. I dropped this class because I had a bad feeling about him. He has lots of assignments and he is ridiculous about how he requires you to submit them. The class has a horrible structure and he treats the students like it is a second grade class.,0
"All she ever does is read off what the questions will be on the test and on the days she doesn't do that, she has groups right a paper using 5 vocab terms, and the papers can be the crappiest and she doesn't care. I didn't learn anything from her class and it was such a waste. I would never voluntarily take her again. Great class for slackers",0
she's so nice and she gives all the help you need to succeed in her class.,1
"I would not take this class again. With this class, it would be impossible for me to even pass. Lecture you had to practically teach to yourself using the powerpoints slides which briefly described the concepts. The practice problem videos were unclear and it did not seem that she was interested in the subject. For lab she was unhelpful and unclear",0
"You must go to all her classes,test are hard,paper is hard but you can team up with a partner,bias,rigid,makes comments without knowing she is hurting others.Study you power points and attend class daily.",0
exams are difficult,0
"Mr. Koehler generally rants about things that have to do nothing with the material of the class. 10% of the class is spent actually looking at the material, and usually, that doesn't end up on the quizzes anyway. I have sat through multiple 2 hour and 20 minute sessions without getting a single note in my notebook.",0
bates is freaking hilarious. great teacher and have learned a lot.,1
"Take this Professor!!! He is so nice and allows you to express yourself in your writing, which was my favorite. He doesn't expect a lot from students so his class is easy but I got to actually enjoy it. Take this class, you wont regret it",1
"She is a nice lady, but that's about as good as it gets for this review. This class was very disorganized. The TAs made a complete mess of the ""project."" If you really want to learn OS, I would hold out for another professor.",0
"Summer AP II is extremely rigorous. Use the Pearson site lab tools to prepare for lab practicals. Those helped me significantly to learn models/diagrams, even more so than actual lab time did. Take pictures of the microscopic slides and memorize key details. Complete the objectives in precise detail. Tests are hard",1
I took him this semester and he says he will respond to emails within 24 hours but Ive emailed him about a project days before it was due and he didnt respond until after it was already turned in. Also he doesnt keep up with grading and you wont really know if you passed the class or not until its basically too late. Will never take again.,0
"Great teacher, really nice and made accounting very digestible.",1
"To start off, THIS IS A WEED OUT CLASS. This means that the class is required to take if you are majoring and he tries to really motivate people to do their best. Tom is a really nice guy who loves his students. He makes it known he wants you to succeed in the major and does everything to prepare you for the future. Very hard class, but rewarding.",1
"Worst Professor Ever. I didn't understand any of the lectures not even one of them. The midterm is all based on proof. I made a big mistake taking his class, I advise you to stay far away from his class. If you can, AVOID at all costs. He is simply a bad teacher. Also, the entire grade was just based on the midterm and the final.",0
Ms. Magdaleno is not only an amazing artist but she is a wonderful teacher.,1
Do not take this professor. She is rude and gets frustrated when you ask questions. Lectures are very disorganized.,0
"Very easy class. Easy quizzes. Attendance was taken everyday but it didn't really have an affect on grade. Fun class. Not hard at all. Projects were not hard at all, given a lot of class time to work on projects. Always accessible before or after class. Would definitely recommend taking this class.",1
"DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HER CLASSES. Very disorganized, doesn't follow syllabus and is harsher on you if you don't have the same opinion as her. Although her classes are art classes, she teaches them more like history classes (I.e memorize dates, names, typical issues of the time period)  If you value your gradessanity do not take her class.",0
"It is difficult for professors to switch to teaching online, but he was simply a terrible professor. No clear expectations for exams and assignments. Questions on tests were full of mistakes. Homework randomly ranges from 1-4 hours. He rarely stuck to the schedule on the syllabus. He was extremely disrespectful to students on multiple occasions.",0
"Danae is an amazing teacher, and has so much passion in her teaching. She is one of my favorite teachers. I took her class Tuesday nights and expected it to be and learned so much! She is an amazing teacher, and made the class very interesting. I loved everything about the class. And homework was enjoyable. I really recommend this class with her!",1
"Prepare to do a lot of reading 150+ pgs a week. You have 10 quizzes, 3 journals, 5 discussions, and a 10-15pg final paper. It's a ton of work, but it's something you can use in everyday life.",1
the class was ran very well in parts 1st and 2nd half the professor explains what you need for this class form textbook and exams he does games and reviews for exams and extra credit take notes his reviews will help you on your test he makes the class fun and interesting gives good lectures show up and pass and try not to be late,1
"He needs to work on his people skills. However, if you have to take a religion class, take with another teacher please.",0
Let's be honest Robinson is a grrrreat person but a horrrible teacher. It is sad to say that someone with as much knowledge on the subject he is teaching NEVER teaches. We have to do these group projects and all this busy work which does not help you learn what Social work is. This is just a heads up take this class if your good at self learning.,0
"Randal was an okay professor. Easy subject, however, all he would do is read from the power point slides or show art history videos. If attendance was not required, I would have only shown up for the quizzes and tests.",0
"Anderson is great! He's always willing to help and makes class interesting. Latin is a tough language to learn but if you go to class and do the translations you will do fine. If you take Latin, take Anderson.",1
The best voice professor ever. She transformed my voice. Shes old school and you cant be one of those sensitive types that gets offended over any kind of critique. Pay attention to her critique because she is going to make you a better singer. I absolutely love her! I went from a not so great singer to a powerhouse.,1
"She's not bad, but really boring lecturer. You have to remember all the readings though, and she takes off for every little thing on exams. Nice person, but boring. Tests aren't bad if you really know about everything she says in class. You need to go to class to do well in the class. ",0
"BTW, the majority of the students are doing fine in the lab skills b/c they have prior esperience at their jobs, or volunteer work. That's a no brainer.",1
"Great Prof. Very sweet, will try to help you as best she can. Definitely read the textbook if you want to do well and make good notes. This is not an easy class, but she is not unfair. Just study and read carefully and you'll do well.",1
Great teacher very easy!!,1
"Kathleen is a super nice women. She's talkative and clearly passionate about writing. She's very helpful with any assignments she assigns and clear about the assignment criteria. Resume, cover letter, LinkedIn, thank you emails, and job related documents are created and revised in this class. I would personally recommend.",1
This guy thinks he is teaching at Harvard and it is almost impossible to go against his opinion. He is always right and makes students feel uncomfortable during class.,0
"Mattson is one of Suny'sbest professors. He likes to talk, but he knows his stuff. I took Vietnam history and thought his class was interesting. I left learning a lot about the subject. I Thought he was so great, that I took other classes with him.His tests are fair and he mostly gives take home papers.",1
"Very hard to understand, and very fast paced talker. Hard to follow what she is saying and I cant stand this teacher. I took her on accident and I hated her class. Regret doing it . Do not take her class.",0
You will pretty much have to teach this course to yourself. He only goes over the examples from the textbook in class and is unclear. Nice guy but horrible lecturer.,0
"This is a relatively harder course to take online, but if you read all the material presented and do the weekly assignments, it makes testing easier.  Questions are specific (attention to detail is important), so get use being able to answer the Where, What, When, Who, and How.",1
This class is hard for anyone that has not taken BIO. She is super sweet but her powerpoint's are too much. She gives us a study guide but its up to use to study the right material. I passed her class with a B but it wasn't easy.,0
"Horrible professor. Might as well be an online course since the only learning done is through youtube. Lecture isn't worth attending, since all he does is grunt and mumble in lecture. Take literally anybody else but Kelm for any calc class he is eligible to teach. And this is coming from someone with 2 years of calc experience.",0
"Good microbiology professor, I would recommend him as one of the best teachers in the CUNY system.",1
"I cringed every time he laughed at one of his own jokes and didn't really like his personality, but the class isn't bad. At least go to the beginning of class for the clicker questions, but otherwise lectures aren't necessary. Neither is the textbook. Use the powerpoints to answer his study guide questions and you should be fine.",1
"This was one of the worst classes I have ever taken. I am fairly certain I will retake it, not because I didn't pass but because I didn't get anything out of it. I don't feel like I have any better understanding of the subject. DON'T TAKE THIS TEACHER! This was a disaster of a class.",0
"If you like comparative lit, you'll love Avital.. She's inspiring, but she tends to talk in circles and goes off on tangents a lot. She doesn't allow computers in her lectures, though, so be warned.",1
"Professor Johansen was awesome!!! Very professional. Very understanding. Simplifies learning at your own pace. Journals were engaging and fun to do and she is very specific as to what is required, so there is no confusion about grading. She was a wonderful teacher and made this class experience fun for me. Definitely take her!",1
Would not recommend taking him. Very difficult grader and does not help very much unless you completely understand the book. I attended every class and participated in almost every lecture and attended office hours and he would not round my 79 to an 80. He will call you out in class and ask you to speak randomly. Don't take this class.,0
"Best introductory Linux courses available in the Puget sound area. I would highly recommend D.C if you want to jump into the Linux world, be a Slackware guru.",1
"This professor may be ok in person but DO NOT TAKE HER ONLINE CLASS It is so hard I literally can't get over a 70 on her quizzes. She gives no extra credit, and is not helpful at all!!!",0
"very knowledgable and well versed on his sujbect matter. His lectures can ramble and sometimes he takes 2 hours to say what could be said in 30 minutes. Overall good instructor, you will learn a lot if you apply yourself and follow his clear instructions. very helpful when you ask for help or clarification",1
"English 201 is a literature survey course, so it's no surprise that there is an exceptional amount of reading. Overall, this professor was fair if you made effort in the classroom. This was not an easy A, but I found that this class was very enjoyable and worth it! Very interetsing professor and no lectures really-lots of class discussions.",1
"She expected you to know everything, but taught you nothing. Lovely lady, but terrible professor. Avoid her at all costs unless you want your GPA to drop!",0
"i have no idea how she got her Phd. her way of teaching is just stupid. i was planning to get at least a B in IE 314 class. but after the final test i was hoping for a D :( . She thinks she is strict, but in reality she is not. she doesnt know how to be flexiable with students. you will understand me if you try other professors in the department.",0
Most amazing professor I have ever had. She cares very much about you and is an amazing teacher. Even when you don't understand something she will explain it so well that you will understand it afterwards. Best organic professor ever !!!!,1
"Dr. A is very good. He is more than willing to stay on one topic as long as you need him to. He doesn't create the tests, so don't blame him for not testing on certain things. You'll need to study ALL of the material from all of the chapters. It is a lot of work, but he definitely assists in making it as easy as he can! DO SIMS!",1
"Fall 2006 was his first semester here, and I think he did a good job.  He's passionate about the subject.  Uses PowerPoint slides that he makes available on BlackBoard, which is very useful if you print them out before class to add notes.  Genuinely cares; created additional study sessions to help students understand anything that didn't sink in.",1
"History can be boring at times, but hes very enthusiastic about history and its obvious that he loves the subject. Just be prepared to take a LOT of notes, so dont skip. Ive had him for history twice, so I highly recommend recording incase you miss any notes. Dont be scared off by his long tests, just study your notes and youll pass.",1
"Took Business Calc summer class and she was a terrible teacher. Didnt care if you understood the material or not, she just had her agenda. When students asked questions she answered in a way that put them down and that made students afraid to ask questions if they didnt understand a problem. Overall she was not good and strict grader.",0
"Students like him because he's an easy grader. His ""holier than thou"" attitude is unbearable, his humor is very dry. Funny how he thinks he understands what he is teaching when he ran for local office twice and didn't win either time lol. Take the class if you want an easy A but if you want to learn something, don't bother.",0
Professor Kaufman was hands down the worst professor I have ever had at RVCC. He is a stingy grader and his tests are unbelievable hard. He doesn't care if his students fail and he is not flexible with grading. I highly recommend anyone to not take his courses. He truly made anthropology an unlikeable subject.,0
Greatest professor at Seton Hall.  Not only teaches you about managerial accounting but also valuable life lessons.  Murtuza is a must take as he is striving to make seton hall great again,1
"The people on here who actually liked Prof Peters must have sucked up because that's the only way she'll like you. Her grading is lame. When she does leave comments on papers, they are completely illegible. She ruined my interest in English. Better participate or she'll fail you. Reading is a must. Least favorite teacher at SBCC or any school. ",0
"Marek is a very courteous and professional individual but he has many flaws in regards to his job as a professor. First of all, he does not tell you what he expect. No rubrics or guidelines are given for projects, so you have to do your best and accept the bad grade that comes with it. He also is very inconsistent with his marking. ",0
"Stay Away. Only grades are 5 tests, each 20% of final plus each one only has three questions. Misleading about curve. Since each test is worth two letter grades, one mistake and you fail the class. Speaks poor english. No help if stuck and no extra credit. Take other classes to avoid this professior.",0
Maria is an amazing instructor! She is very knowledgeable on the subject and has some great life experiences that she will sometimes bring into the lecture. She explains well and is very clear when it comes to her expectations for the exams and projects. I wish I had another class with her!,1
The class is super boring. He super arrogant. He only talk about himself and bragging about his connection.,0
"Definitely not a hard class/teacher. You just have to show up, do your homework, study and ask questions. Nothing super crazy though, easy A in my opinion.",1
Tres long et ennuyeux,0
This class seemed easy until finals came around. She makes the chest sheet for you which for me is not very helpful as what makes sense to her does not make sense to me. She was however very understanding during the other parts of the course I doubt Ill pass this class.,0
"No textbook, just a link to papers he's written about sociologists. Multiple choice questions are really just papers written in response to his writings. A paper a week plus extra book reports. Not engaging, treats you like a child & makes comments if you don't have prep notes for his papers that are written more suitable to an upper level class.",0
"His lecture consisted of him scribbling incomprehensibly all over the board.  All learning was done entirely from the text, as he did not instruct in any sort of clear way.",0
Arnold is obviously very enthusiastic about science. But the class... boring and a waste of time. I would have ditched if attendance wasn't mandatory. The 10-day unit plan we had to create - a burden that I won't ever look at again. The whole unit assignment needs to be revamped somehow.,0
"If you take any of Professor O'Quinn's classes, make it the one class that you show up to consistently and LISTEN. Seriously. Listen to what he has to say. He's one of the most brilliant English profs I've ever had and can make even the driest subjects mind-blowing. If you show up with enthusiasm and pay attention, you will learn so much from him.",1
Grades hard for no reason. Its an easy class you just get no chance to ask questions because she acts like your dumb if you do.,0
"His lectures consist of online powerpoints which you can access at home. There was no point in going to class because he would just read off the slides. I passed the course by reading the textbook, constantly. He does curve test scores. The test consists of phrases from the text and slides.",0
He is the worst and does not care how hard he makes a 100 level class. I hate this guy with a passion.,0
"Mr. Perez was by far one of the best professors I have had at riddle. No matter the size of the problem I had he always responded to his emails fast with an answer that actually solved my problem. At the end of my online class, we had a group project where I worked alone. Mr. Perez worked with me to help with the lack of team effort.",1
"Be ready to get outside help from tutors, SI, or other classmates from the beginning of the class. There are homework problems. Do them before class he lectures about them! This is a class that you have to stay on top of. He doesn't really explain the example problems in class.",0
"VERY BORING. class moves very slow even though material is easy. Could do the lecture in half the time but it drags. Allows one absence. Does a lot of group work during class that is pointless. Discussions, no textbook, essays, group projects. SO BORING and she is kind of confusing ",0
This instructor is very vague in her assignments and will turn around and tell you you didnt read the assignment if you didnt do it to her standards. Everyone in the class gets confused and while she seems like a nice person she is not a great teacher.,0
"His teaching style is not easy to adapt to. The concepts in the class are drowned out by his example problems and poor explanations. The guy ""teaches"" coding and algorithms yet doesn't have the ability to operate his laptop (which uses Win '98...).",0
"This class is an easy A but the issue is she grades your free response answers on the quizzes, tests, the 2 assignments, and 2 discussion posts with impossible expectations. She says not to plagiarize but then she COPY AND PASTES questions and its answers from the FREE ONLY TEXTBOOK (openstax - American Government 2e). PS who cites for a trivia????",0
Hard grader (very hard to get a A on anything). Teaching style is very dry and makes it hard to keep focus and learn from lectures. Troys to cram too much information into such a small amount of time.,0
His homework requirements sheet is vague and everyone could come up with their own interpretation but you will be graded based on how close you can get to his interpretation of the question and close to someones solution he thinks is the best. His grading is very strict and unfair at times.,0
A person inflexibly attached to policy without regard to its practicality.,0
This professor had an open discussion forum.  It was helpful to see different outlooks.  Dr. Coutinho was always insightful on different projects.  The course was stress free and life changing.  Highly recommend him.,1
Prof. Keeling is an amazing professor! she is a gem! recommend going to her office if you have questions about something or if you need help with something. would take her again.,1
Amazing professor. She used the Margolis Method from a woman named Kari. The method worked. And she creates her own vocal warm ups. I would 100 percent take her again.,1
"Be super careful on tests as she will ding you for the slightest thing. Lectures quickly, making it difficult to understand everything. Goes over time on the lectures every time, making it difficult to make it to your next class on time. Believes that memorization is easy for everyone. Not the worst professor I've had, but definitely not the best.",0
"All of the great reviews on him are accurate. He is very easy to understand, he is organized, he posts the PP slides on BB if you don't want to go to class, and you don't really need to do much if any reading at all. If you show up to class and take notes you are almost guaranteed an A. Would take him for all of my history courses if I could.",1
"confusing questions, unclear expectations and unavailable. awful professor stay away from any classes he teaches",0
Best professor I've had so far! She is passionate about her career and education in general. Although she has strong personal opinions she doesn't dismiss others beliefs on certain topics. She helps everyone as much as possible. If you do your work and participate you will have no trouble passing. She made this class a fun experience.,1
Worse professor EVER! He expects you to know everything & can be rude & sarcastic to students. He was also barely ever willing to explain things. His tests are 80-100 questions & spent class talking about Connecticut & all the trainings he attends,0
She wouldn't cut me some slack and bump my D+ to a C- just so I could pass during the coronavirus pandemic. Overall she's a good professor but I just wish she was a little more understanding.,0
Utilizes a lot of examples from business. Does a good job of explaining the material.,1
"Wonderful professor! My only complaint is at times she can be too easy to pass. If you are not self motivated to learn the material, you can still get an A with very little effort while learning very little. Otherwise, helpful with good lectures and very easy to talk to. ",1
"Mr. Velasco is a really nice teacher. Participation counts in his class, but it just feels like everyone is discussing ideas nothing drastic. He is really understanding and just use the study guides to prepare for the tests.",1
"Not helpful. Extremely Hard marker with stupid multiple choice selections like ""C. None of the above D. None of them apply"". Makes you do your whole group project on D2L which is extremely inconvenient and inefficient. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.",0
It's very clear on what she wants you to do. Papers are back to back. Also she will not grade any of the papers on time.,0
Makes many mistakes and doesn't take questions. Would not recommend if not STRONGLY proficient already in math 122. Be prepared to be given hours of homework each night.,0
I took Prof. Zeman for A&P I and Microbiology she is a wonderful professor. She is very nice and extremely helpful. She makes everything clear. Her test are not that difficult as long as you study you will get a good grade. Her exams also have extra credit available. I definitely recommend her!,1
I found this class quite confusing. The lectures never seemed to match with the tests and seemed to be mostly a distraction from the subject matter. A vocabulary lists words and definitions that are surprising since most are never addressed in class.The links to Wikipedia prove especially annoying since I'm not paying to have Wikipedia teach me.,0
"Excellent lecturer! Presented International Politics in a way that made me want to go to class, even though it wasn't mandatory.  My interest was peaked whilst taking the course but IP is not my thing. Definitely check him out though, great prof!",1
"I loved the Course, especially with George. He is very specific in his requirements for the course. You should attend classes because he goes over important stuff too. He is genuinely caring if you talk to him.",1
"This class is a mess... He had no idea how to teach Unity and also was confused every class, his TA even more. He was also late to every class, cutting class time by 20 mins on average. If you actually wish to learn game dev, skip ASU & learn it from another school or online. CPI111 was already bad, but CPI211 isn't even a class, but it is an ez A.",0
"Overall, my online class was pretty straight forward. The only thing I didnt like was how we were slapped randomly with an extensive assignment and a final about something we wrote two posts about. If a study guide was given, I would have liked it a bit better.",1
"He made me wanting to transfer to management major. He is great at teaching, easy grader, just 3 essays through the whole semester. Take him.",1
"Great professor. If you're looking for a career in the sports industry and have any questions, you can go to her and shell give you the answer most of the time. Overall this class was fun and taught me a lot about what it takes to be a professional in the sports industry.",1
He's a very chill guy. Really laid back and lots of extra credit. But there is a lot of homework and assignments in his class. He grades so slowly and is unorganized. You won't know your grade anytime soon no matter how much you bug him. I wish he would get organized. But other than that he's really chill and inspiring! Take him at least I passed.,1
"Honestly, not as terrible as everyone says. She is an awful lecturer and makes the material dry, but if you show up to every lecture, take pictures of the images that she omits in her lecture notes, and have good memorization skills then you're fine. Easy A for science (biology) majors. The tests are a lot of writing, so you can BS a lot of it.",0
"This guy does really messed up things like give problems on tests that use notations youve never ever seen before, or material you've never seen before. Need to put a lot of effort in to pass, but he does know what hes talking about and will help you if you go to his office hours. Does not curve and is the most unfair teacher in math department.",0
"Dr. Spiczak is genuinely such a smart man. That being said, he struggles interpreting the information to students in a clear and orderly manner. One - on - one he is much easier to understand, so I'd make sure to check his office hours. He's a very generous grader, the curves on his tests and overall class is favorable. ",0
"Mrs. Wang is the best math professor ever, no kidding/exaggeration. Her lectures are perfectly concise and she will do ANYTHING to help you master the material. She set up study halls on Saturdays for students who wanted to come in for more help (everyone benefiting from everyone else's questions). Correct ur mistakes on tests for half credit.",1
"Honors class, very dull. Teacher is more interested in her own personal stories than teaching a subject. Thinks she is very worldly, but isn't. If you have a choice between her class or being pepper sprayed, get sprayed. It will hurt less.",0
"This guy is legit! I don't know why he gets so much guff on his online classes. In-person, Dr. Goodyear is someone who takes his course material seriously, but he doesn't take himself too seriously. Consequently, his class has a laid-back, low-stress kinda vibe; but stay engaged with his lectures! Very relatable, but textbook reading still a must.",1

"Awesome professor! Great lectures! He makes difficult material so easy to understand. Not having an A in his class, would honestly require active self sabotage, because he gives SO many extra credit opportunities. He cares so much about his students.",1
Randy is a great guy and wants to further our futures art. Super cool and nice guy! Wants you to succeed and helps you with your project ideas if need be.,1
"Super easy class. Just do the work and cite things correctly, that's all you need to do. You only get 4 essays that have a 450 word minimum and 6 multiple choice quizzes. Everything is open book. Take him if you are taking the class because it is a requirement and don't really care about learning and want something easy.",1
I had SOC201 with Hallett and this course was a small class and was project based. We got into groups the first week and the rest of the semester was working on the project with a little bit of homework. The material was not difficult and her lectures and notes were helpful.,1
No Comments,1
I enjoyed my class with Dr. Currier. She's clearly passionate about micro and enjoys teaching. She broke up lecture by having small group questions (not projects or anything) to help review. Definitely recommend the e-book and using the quizzes in it to study. She gives you extra credit for doing them as well. Tests are pretty difficult.,1
"This class was easy except for the chronological portion on the exams. You have to know certain dates. The terms she gives you is what is tested on, she doesnt pull outside information. You will have 1 paper and you are able to submit it twice for a better grade. Her lectures are interesting, but sometimes she goes fast explaining the terms.",1
"He does not go over prelab, he leaves the stuff on the counter tells you to read the manual with no direction. We weren't provided with the materials the lab manual states to use. When asked for help he just says ""read it"" repeatedly. Lectures are insufficient and criteria for what he wants is unclear. He had to curve his class very hard. Be warned",0
He is approachable.,0
"a complete mean, arrogant man. Had for visual fund. He recently told the class that we deserved to die if we did not vote (in which it is against some of the classmates religion) and also that 85 percent of the class is waisting their time in school and will be working in retail in their future. Forgive me if i am wrong, but teachers are to help mo",0
"I came to every class, asked questions, read the book, followed her syllabus and rubrics, and still did terrible in the class.  She's a really nice person, but just reads from the power point during class and doesn't go into great detail with examples.  The tests were extremely difficult and she graded the papers very harshly.   ",0
"This is the absolute most disrespectful person I have ever had to encounter. Extremely rude, unsympathetic, and name calls. Completely unprofessional, and you need to have some proof that you were tardy else she will mark you as unexcused absent causing your grade to be potentially affected. Avoid this professor at all costs.",0
"Boring, tardy, unclear and verbose",0
She is glamorous as ever but not as helpful. She will help if you go to office hours but she tends to talk in circles. I really wanted to like her but I don't feel like she explained what was necessary. I will say she attempted but it wasn't the best.,0
"Very educated teacher who expects his students to be on the same wavelength. That being said i learned a lot about the preternatural, so many other fields of science, and even some Latin. Pay attention, do the hw and don't skip.",1
"Everything is confusing for me (can't speak for everyone else). Even when I'd get help, it just always seems like she doesn't really want to help because ""we should know this already"". Math used to be my favorite subject and now, I hate it.",0
He refuses to use Canvas or email so contacting him outside of class is a hassle. He rarely takes time to explain the lessons so he almost expects you to know what he's doing. It's honestly easier to learn from the textbook than from his lectures. His tests seem simple but his grading makes it difficult. Just horrible and difficult.,0
"she has a really thick accent, so at first it is hard to understand her, but you get used to it. her tests are very straight forward, the study guide is essentially the test, but just in a different order. COME TO THE CLASS BEFORE THE TEST. she goes through the study guide and gives you all the answers, but only in class.",1
Not a good lecturer. All he does is assign youtube videos to watch at home and tests you on it. His classes consist of answering questions about the homework and correcting quiz questions you got wrong. Only reason I passed is because I took Calculus in High School. I chose to take 75B with him after 75A because there's very little work to do.,0
Lecture notes are not very helpful. He is a very good guy but doesnt give very meaningful notes.,0
"I cannot say how Dr. King is during in-person classes, hence my rating instead of 2 instead of 1. I can tell he is passionate about the subject for sure, but Dr. King ended up just assigning textbook readings instead of doing much actual teaching, leaving you to teach yourself. Perhaps it'll be different once classes are in-person again. Hard tests",0
prof rodriguez is a great professor. there is really only one concern i had. He doesnt really answer his emails promptly which can cause alot of confusion. overall it is a good class to take. The final project is a little tough but as long as you show some effort youll get the credit. ,1
very strict with turning things in and grades hard...,0
"Don't take this guy if you are someone that needs organization. Lectures are PPT presentations that are like 120-157 slides long and boring as hell. He lies about assignments like he'll say to 1 person that  paper should be 1 page, then a week later, he'll tell someone else its supposed to be 3 pages. no one knew their grade til last week. he's bad",0
"Get ready to have to do at least 50 pages of reading (textbook and articles), watch 30-45 mins of videos AND read about 20-30 powerpoint slides PER WEEK. The quizzes are open book, but the questions are so specific that, no matter how much you prepare/study, you will still have no idea what's going on. Also, lots of trick questions.",0
"I loved her teaching style. Very informed and actually interested in what you have to say. Easy to talk to, and willing to work with you for you to succeed. Would highly recommend her to anyone. Great proff that cares about her students.",1
"Difficulty in class is due to material, NOT professor. During Midterm week we had 5 exams, the last Friday was capitalized by a Quiz none of us had prepared for. You could feel the mood of the room and asked if he could move the quiz. We were fried and he knew it. We reviewed the topic and he moved the quiz. I will always respect him for this.",1
"professor Andrews , he is a good professor I like him and he is very easy .I like his class and I encourage other students to take classes with him.",1
"Dr. Mark is extremely passionate about her Human Resources, and very positive. If you need any help she (and her GA) are more than happy to help. Make sure that you participate in class, otherwise it will hurt you in your 'participation' category. Stay ahead of your online discussion posts (called Yellowdig) and do your work.",1
Lectures are hard to pay attention to b/c kinda boring. Tests were hard considering the class basically failed. NO CURVE. Iclickers so class is mandatory.,0
"Like below, nice person, god awful teacher. Although she is willing to help when needed, she's not clear on anything during class. The subject is hard enough. The first test she gave a sheet of about 200 anatomy terms to know and about 30 were on the test, its like that for every test. Waste of time studying and guessing whats on test. FRUSTRATING",0
You have to teach yourself. No matter how many zoom recordings reviews & practice exams BE PREPARED TO TEACH YOURSELF. I regret taking this professor esp. online. Homework takes up majority of your time and has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EXAMS & reviews HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EXAMS! take her if it's your last option. You've been warned! Be wise!,0
"After 60 hours worth of classes, she is by far the worst professor I've ever had. I took the summer session A&P course and it was the most sporadic and unorganized class ever. She would loose our graded papers,  biased when it came to essay questions, and overall rude to students. She would make you feel unreasonably incompetent if you asked a ?.",0
The worst professor ever :(. please don't take her class I had no choice but take her class because when I register for class all the teacher info was TBD. I got so much stress just thinking about going to her class. she doesn't give you enough direction to perform any experiment and she is awfully sarcastic at everything.,0
"Excellent for 108. NOT for 201.  I was 2% away from passing and I only missed one class AND did tutoring, and she didn't care.  Only cares about smart students or those in front row. Rude outside of class. She got corrected EVERY class period.  not a good teacher for 201",0
"He completely killed any passion I had for Math. I went into this class excited to progress my Math learning, and he shriveled up my dreams like a raisin in the sun. I cant tell you enough DO NOT TAKE HIM, you WILL fail. This is not a challenge, please save yourself  He's got an alright sense of humor though BUT do not take him.",0
"Run in the opposite direction. He's Satan when he writes those exams from hell. His lectures are awesome, but those exams are hard!!!!",0
"After taking both Seminar and Management with Monahan at the helm, I quickly realized what a star of a professor that SCCC has on their hands. His lectures are like no other, and he truly cares about his students. The next semester, I chose to do what so many others do, and take a third Monahan class, completing the ""experience"". He's the man!",1
"Took this class last summer and it was not a pleasant experience. He hardly lectures and expects students to commit their time hours-on-end on difficult hw, online quizzes and in-class worksheets which barely reflected his simple lectures. He can get frustrated easily with struggling students too. The only upside about him is that he curves exams.",0
Doesn't explain things well in order for you to get a really good grade in this course. A calculator is not allowed! Better be excellent at Math or you probably won't pass. Majority of students dropped his class and one student switched her degree because of this professor!!! HORRIBLE WOULD NOT EVER RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!! TAKE SOMEONE ELSE!!!!,0
Definitely take this course with her if you like for people to be condescending to you. Heavy workload. Assumes everyone wants to be a Pollution Manager...This course and instructor were so not worth my time. The material could be interesting if you didn't have to WASTE so much time being an English major for an Environmental Studies course.,0
"Essays and final exam were the hard ones. quizzes and midterm was easy. Not an easy class, take notes, but listen even more carefully. exams are going to have what were on the lectures. VERY HELPFUL. if you are not doing so well in the middle of the semester, just visit him in office hour and you will end up where you wanted.",1
"I didn't ever meet him. He left his class to a TA who made the class absolutely miserable. There is no professionalism whatsoever. I would have been nice to have an actual professor teaching this lab course, or at least having more of a handle on the way the TA was teaching. She was so condescending and rude people refused to ask questions.",0
"Don't get fooled like me with these reviews. STAY AWAY. You have been warned! This class is unbearable online. professor is unorganized, inconsistent and gives a lot of work in a little time yet takes about a month to grade assignments. Had to withdraw to save my sanity.",0
"Elementary Logic is very much like Algebra or other forms of math.  If you do not enjoy math or are not good at math, avoid  Elementary Logic.",0
do not recommend her,0
"Professor Murphy is easily sidetracked and very disorganized. Our class was unable to cover even half of the material intended for the course. This caused many students to not take the class seriously and become rude and disruptive, making for a bad learning environment. The final grade was based on a total of three assignments.",0
"This man is the worst professor I have ever encountered. Disorganized, wild tangents about Nazis and Eugenics, and ""jokes"" that would probably get a student a one-on-one meeting with the dean. Stay as far away from this guy as you can. Tests and finals used to be easy, but he had instructions from admin to change them, now they're super difficult.",0
You can tell he knows his stuff but it is kind of difficult understanding what he's teaching. Tests are difficult.,0
She responds fast to emails and provide great feedback about an assignment.. She knows what she's talking about and I took her every semester while taking my BS in criminal justice. Keep up the great work !! ),1
"give low really grade on lab report although u have 20 pages, barely can hear him, never ever c/p someone's work on ur report even though u only use  5% out of ur entire work, he considers it's cheating, and report to university. over all he is easy but mean.",0
"Pete is awesome. This class is a lot of fun and extremely interesting. I think it is rare you would ever be able to discuss and study such explicit material in a classroom setting. This material, nonetheless, is so fascinating and very engaging. A must take class here at Duke!",1
"One missed class will bring you down basically a letter grade. Lectures are circular, slow, and if they do end up coming to a point the point is generally something that any breathing human could have gotten to on their own at age 15. There's no final but there's a funky amount of busywork. Daily discussions are torturous. A very timid teacher.",0
This teacher takes forever to grade assignments.  I took him three weeks to grade discussion questions and homework assignment that were suppose d to be graded the first three weeks in class.  His discussions don't follow along with the book.  So it's important to read the book and not listen to his discussions if u want to pass tests.,0
"Dr. Sarah La Belle's passion for ""research methods"" can take a toll on someone. Going to her class everyday was BEYOND the worst experience I have had in my very long time in academia. Do yourself a favor, do not take this class. There are other ways to fulfill the research methods cred (soc295 forsome). You will be saying, what is research method?",0
DEAN DOESN'T KNOW HIS RED PINE FROM HIS SCOTCH PINE!,0
PROS: 1.) automatic 50% for just turning in assignment. 2.) Automatic 100% for submitting completed assignment. 3.) Plenty extra credit! CONS: 1.) Little directions on how to do assignments 2.) Gives mostly busy work 3.) Portfolio worth 50% of grade 4.) Don't miss class for any reason,1
Not the best professor. if you don't have the same opinion be prepared not to do well on tests.,0
"My time in Professor Kanchi's course can be summed up through one thing she said to me when I asked her a question about the homework: ""Why are you using the lecture notes to answer these? Use the books instead, they give much better information than what we covered in class"".",0
Erica makes you work for your A. Go to lecture and take notes. Do the readings. Clarifies very well during office hours. I enjoyed the class very much. Very interesting content. Makes exams from study guide she provides. Use them Don't be afraid to ask questions and for help when needed. Has a lot of common phrases that she repeats during class.   ,1
Petty work load.. Busy work,0
"Phil is a great lecturer. There are quizzes every week, but they aren't hard and if you pay attention, you'll be fine. He really likes to talk about more than what's on the slides he uses. Really useful info. He also grades his papers really hard.",1
She is very nice and makes you work hard on project but helps you a lot. Overall she is very good grader.,1
"Participation is important to her and will ask you to participate directly. She is enthusiastic about the subject and is very critical of you if you do not do your work. In this manner I think she is caring, she gives at least 2 short essays per week, final is on book of choice. Musts, use the writing center, check your grammar, submit on time.",1
This was my favorite class. The reading and assignments were so interesting. For an online class this teacher was very responsive and helpful and writes very clear directions for assignments.,1
"I took Professor Tulin for Honors Humanities 1. He is a great and passionate teacher but his course is very discussion board, essay, group project, and reading heavy. You will have weekly discussion posts and a group project over a book that he assigns. You will have to read several books throughout the semester and attendance is mandatory.",1
"Tabea is a brilliant instructor. She can be quite intimidating and her syllabus is daunting, but as the term goes along you will  realize that she is super kind and her assignments are manageable. If you show up to class and do what you're responsible for, you'll have a great experience in her class. Dont go on your phone when shes lecturing. Ever.",1
"I had Kim for lecture and lab. She's amazing in lab, but dismal in lecture. She would go off on tangents, then speed through the remaining slides expecting you to understand everything. Her final was filled with mechanisms she told us about last minute. If you try to get points back, don't expect her to be nice. Hard HW. Very unprepared for 3020:/",0
"This guy is the worst. Plays favorites like crazy. God forbid you have your phone out in class or else he will take it. He runs his classroom as if it were a high school class, for an upper level business class with mostly seniors in it, it is quite ridiculous. He loves making people feel uncomfortable, has a serious superiority complex. Avoid! ",0
Hes ok! Sometimes his mouth cant keep up with his brain.,1
One of the best professor in University at Albany,1
She is a good at accounting but not necessarily teaching but she can be rude sometimes especially if you're late or aren't showing up. I would not take again.,1
"she puts up with loud people in a huge lecture hall, so she gets props for that.  the subject can only be so much fun to talk about for an hour and she does an ok job keeping it interesting.  however, the class is really easy, and she makes it seem hard or like we're all stupid.  easy class",1
":( Im usually an honor roll student. taking this class makes me feel like Im dumb. There is a quiz every class period and hes not clear on whats on them. Even when he is, they are next to impossible to get 100%. It could be me, but personally I would not recommend this class. Solid 0/10.",0
this teacher is okay. After the first test i realized showing up for her lectures was the dumbest thing i was doing. The test are 100 % based on you knowing the terms and identifying them in scenarios. What she talks about in class is so off topic and her slides are generic with no definitions or key notes. They will not help.,0
good prof. very clear instruction.,1
"I understand that online classes are probably hard to teach, but she was totally AWOL the whole time. I emailed her four times during the class, and she never once got back to me. She would fix and change things but never communicate at all. The class is graded (often outdated) busywork, more time consuming than chemistry or calculus.",0
terrible,0
"He's a good guy, but not my favorite professor. He makes attendance worth a test grade (plus some extra) which is nice if you go to every class, but his lectures aren't very helpful. I and most of the people I know in this class only learned from the book. So definitely buy the book.",0
Extremely rude professor.,0
"Super nice and helpful, easy to understand, knows the subject very well, but don't ever expect to get out of class early. If you get through all the material for the day she'll go back and review for the remaining 5 minutes or 50 minutes, because she wants students to get their money worth. Having Devito for K helped a lot with my success in Sales.",1
"Holly does not teach the class. She spends the whole class talking about her personal life and will spend 10 minutes at the end of class barely teaching coding, and keeps us 10 minutes late after class because she doesn't want to teach during the actual class. She doesn't care about shy people and grades extremely hard. Lynda will be your friend.",0
"Prof. Calkins was an awesome teacher! I held an A all year because of the feedback that she gave on all my papers. There is a lot of reading and online discussion posts, but they all help with the major assignments. I would definitely take her again!",1
"Jenneke is less of a class and more of a commitment, but it's very rewarding. She's willing to work with you along the way as long as she can see you're actually trying to achieve your goal. One of the best instructors I've ever had.",1
"He is very good pro,  everyone should get A . Try his class",1
"He is a nice guy who loves to joke around. He's not a strict grader, or strict about anything really. Not good for super serious students.",1
"She's not terrible, but she rushes during classes and she expects us to know as much as she does with the content. I asked her a few questions,&there are just times when she just assumes that you know it already. She reads from the textbook ,I thought going to class was futile. She goes through mechanics without explaining what purposes  they serve",0
"I am not sure why so many students like this teacher. Calling her nice is like calling a rabid dog friendly. She grades at a post graduate level, and is not very approachable. If you take her in conduct, you will have a different professor for the first semester than the second.  Maybe she changes over the holidays. Study 8 hours a week or take a C",0
DO NOT TAKE HER! She gives a lot of assignments and takes a long time to grade them. She doesn't explain anything and never responds to emails. Plus a lot of presentations.,0
She is not good about getting back to her students if you email her.  She doesn't use the PAL grade book so you have to ask her for your grades.  She is a very strict grader.,0
"Prof Zuidervaart is a gem of a teacher, take her! She used to be the English chair and stepped down a little bit ago if I'm not mistaken. If you're good at English, this class will be easy. The lectures are straightforward and you do 4 papers (3 over the summer). Each one is to hone in certain skills; show her you can do those, and you'll do great.",1
"Professor Harvey was amazing. Due to the pandemic during the semester, we had to switch to the online class (both lab and lecture), but she tried to make everything easier for us (recording lectures, great workshops, and etc).she is very kind and caring. chem 102 is not an easy class, get ready to study, but Dr. Harvey helps you a lot. Good Luck!",1
"The hardest class I have ever attended. While she is a nice person, her grading system is subjective. It's almost as if she expects prior knowledge of economic perspectives before taking the class. Avoid her class(es) if possible",0
"I have never once had any issues with any professors at Clark, but Jamey Marsh is not one that I would recommend taking. I would not say that Professor Marsh cares about his students success because he purposefully sets you up to fail. He is not helpful when it comes to trying to understand what you got wrong, and you only pass because of the curve",0
"She really sends you out of the class if you are 5mins late.I narrowly passed this class,before every test she gives a handout of what would be on the test. but don't let that fool you,if you do not answer in her own words she marks you down,so you are basically studying to fail. I do not recommend her at all. I felt like i was still in high school",0
"Ill be honest, yeah he is not the best at teaching BUT outside of class he really wants you to do well and acc would help you, so talk to him, he is so kind and understanding and mans acc funny! I didn't expect to do well, but he helped me get the grade I needed!",1
You never put a first year teaching in such a serious class,0
This man is the worst person and the worst professor.,0
"Very fair course. Yes, I won't lie, his lectures are quite unclear, but if you follow along in the book and do all the homework you will do fine in this class. The tests were difficult and there's a quiz almost every class but just put in the work. very nice and he will help you if you seek it. Take him over sepinsky.",0
"This is a terrible class. DO NOT take him. He is not clear and makes you read a whole book for approximately 2-3 questions on the test. There are about 4/5 books. He does not care about the students and is rude and oblivious. One question on test is one percent of grade. Do not take, very bad class!",0
"Mr. Brooks's class was very difficult. A lot of my class mates withdrew. I think there were maybe 7 of us left. However, I am very glad I took his class. I learned a lot from him, especially about composition.",1
"do not take him-does read out of the book, is clear in teaching, but totally unfair-takes a lot of points, and not reasonable. the humor works while in class, at the end when u get ur grade-hes not fair!",0
"This the worst teacher ever.  She talks like she makes a lot of sense but unless you are a research expert, you will never understand what she is saying. If you ask too many questions in order to clarify her teachings, she gets upset and is either rude or disregards what you say. In the end she did grade on a cruve but the stress doesn't compensate",0
"motivate? he constintly puts people down, refering to their personal lives, and when asked for help often catches an attitude. He makes you work double hard to earn extra days off, but the days have to be benificial to him. He plays favorites badly so kiss butt!",0
"Would give the weeks assignments halfway through the week, it's December 24th and the most recent assignment entered is from September. Kept on pushing back deadlines and essentially made the class last until December 23rd. Easy class. Pretty funny but posts some kind cringe anime memes but if that's your thing then go for it.",0
moderate,1
"Dr. Berger is a really funny guy who has a great personality. He's pretty tough to follow in lecture, but the exams are a piece of cake. For intro to computer engineering, half the mid-term is in class, half take home, easy grade. Then there's a presentation you have to do which is another easy grade. Final exam is all take home. Class is an easy A",1
"Great teacher, grade consists of 8 out of 12 response papers, 2 exams, and 2 research papers. Make sure to keep up with the reading and you'll do fine but it is quite a good bit of reading. Very caring and will help you out if you miss a couple assignments",1
"Unclear on assignments, had us set our own due dates. Purposely graded tests wrong so u can correct her and get bonus points. If u like nature and writing about trees, this is your class. Otherwise, stay clear. She cancelled 8 classes this semester, not including holidays.",0
Mrs. V is one of the best teachers ive had at wake tech. She explains the concepts that will be on the test and the labs we completed were fun. Recommend her to all of my friends. Put forth a little bit of effort in this class and you can pull out a B if not an A.,1
I usually always fail history but for the first time I understood and passed history with an A. Her lectures are really well written and she makes the content easy to understand. As long as you pay attention and you do the homework youll easily pass the exams. I would definitely take her again.,1
"Dr. Hansen does an assignment called ""Brown Bag"" where he meets up and has lunch with a group of students from his classes. This is so he can get to know each of his students. He really cares about his student's individual situations. If you need more time on an assignment or test and have a valid reason he will work with you. He is very kind.",1
Oh my God where should I start. Stay away Professor Thompson is so very terrible. If you like sitting through long boring lectures that have nothing to do with what youre going to be tested on then this is your class. His Tests are made up as riddles and have nothing to do with the material gone over in class. Stay away very far away.,0
"Unfortunately, this is just a terribly made class that has seen little improvement in the years that it has been offered. McEntie isn't a bad instructor, but his lectures are boring and lots of filter talk. The textbook is not extremely helpful either. I wished they could use articles online since that has helped me much more. Hard class for a 100.",0
While Mrs Yang is a very kind professor her ideas over group work are less than ideal. She will assign people to random groups at the beginning and at the middle point of the semester. Group work sometimes isnt bad but when you get stuck with a bad group it hurts your grade bad. The professor also did nothing as one or two groups had conflicts.,0
"Professor Fritsche does a good job at explaining things, he takes his time to explain things if you are confused. There is a lot of homework but the notes that are taken in class help you a lot with it.",1
Extremely harsh grader that makes you feel like the worst writer in the world. Pray for a B.,0
"Nice but grading is arbitrary. Turned in final draft of paper that was nearly identical to 1st draft and got perfect score on final but B+ on 1st draft. Students with weaker presentation skills graded more leniently. Largest grade scaled down based on rating given by teammates, opening you up to being screwed by anyone you had a disagreement with.",0
"Dr. Miller is awesome! He is good at approaching hard-to-learn biological concepts so that they are easier to pick up. He gives a lot of extra credit, so there's no excuse for a low grade. IF you study hard, you will leave this class with a good understanding of A/P. His favorite line seems to be ""Diffusion: ALMOST always a good answer!""",1
Fowler is totally disorganized. Class discussions are rambling and unplanned and it's not clear what you're supposed to get from them. Class is almost entirely digression. Horribly unstructured.,0
She was horrible. Took her as my first class and there was absolutely no remorse for me as someone new to college and the hybrid format. She took the class way too seriously considering it's a required class and rather pointless in the age of the internet.,0
"She has a very high energy level.  If you're not sure about poetry, take this class.",1
"She's a really good teacher and the assignments are easy but she's really big on attendance, she is really fun to work with. As long as you go to class nd do your work you ae sure to pass,",1
Shes very rude and doesnt even do english its all about plants,0
"He is a good human being, but his tests are tough. Not too much homework, but a lot of reading. Sometimes when M.R jones talks, he uses a lot of pronouns, so you miss what he is talking about. Also, half of the class is about brain anatomy which is in my opinion, not a part of psychology.",0
"I really liked his class.He is really straightforward.Exams are not bad.What I DONT like is his grading scale.Even though you have a chance to bump up your score,it still makes life more difficult.The reading is only a little intense but as long as you get the main points, you'll be good.I didnt even finish reading and I got the right answers.",1
"I don't like thw fact that he uses a website through a website for the class just stick to one. The subscription for the second website is not free and students must pay for it on their own. I have not struggled to figure out what was going on using the canvas website until this class, every other class was clear and straight forward.",0
actually found him as a hard grader but he gives opportunities when needed. based on midterm and final. He is super passionate about what he is teaching but personally was not interested so much,1
The way she teaches is confusing. She expects you to know how to do problems before she explains them and then when you don't know the answer she acts like your stupid. The class average for the second test we took was 60%. Then she gave us a 25 minute lecture about how we should have done better.,0
"So sad that she's retiring! She gave so many extra credits questions on test and quizzes plus gave extra credit quizzes!!! Her lectures are extremely long and dreading, but she makes sure she goes through everything. Her test and quizzes are more based off of the book than her lecture. Overall, she was a great teacher!",1
"She assigns a lot of readings, but you don't necessarily have to read them all to pass the class. Overall, I think she fit in a lot of material in a short period of time, and I felt like I learned a lot. However, her instructions for assignments could be confusing, and we had to ask for clarification of expectations a lot.",1
Bad communication skills,0
Shon is a great person and really does care about his students however his teaching style is very hit or miss. He puts excel on the board and tells us to print it out so we can write out our own notes on it but his edits throughout the class are too much and hard to keep up with. I learned more from teaching it to myself than from class.,1
"All the class is about the tests, but requires homework and turning in scratch paper from all assignments. No real in class instruction.",0
3 mc exams on definitions found in the textbook. 5 easy hw assignments. he grades on participation and attendance but as long as you show up you'll be fine. he doesn't allow any electronics. you don't need to pay attention long as you memorize about 50 terms each exam. he's approachable and always willing to explain more. kinda boring lectures.,1
"Review sheets and in-class quizzes do nothing to prepare you for the tests. She is a great teacher with passion for finance however her tests are insane. She expects you to know how to solve problems that you don't discuss in class. If possible, I would recommend another professor just because her tests are INCREDIBLY hard.",0
"I have no idea what those others are talking about saying shes a bad teacher. The only way youre getting an F or a low grade because you dont pay attention in class and not doing your homework. I failed two math classes because the other teachers were horrible. Prof Choi Baek, not only a great math teacher, but shes a great teacher overall.",1
"Professor Lee is a great instructor, she teaches well to where the students understand. she gives extra credit assignments to help improve grades. Which helps students that are struggling.I do wish she was available to tutor outside of class it would be helpful because her style of teaching is understanding but some students need extra attention.",1
Very very hard class. Professor Alse seems like a really smart guy but is not a very good teacher at all. His in class lectures are just all over the place and are really hard to follow I had an easier time understanding the material by reading the book.  His tests are extremely difficult be prepared to study all day and all night before the test.,0
"Although you learn some cool technology uses, the environment in the classroom was awful. He'll constantly go off topic on things unrelated to class making the class feel longer than it already is. He constantly yells, get frustrated and impatient to any student wanting to ask questions or clarification and overall an unpleasant person. STAY AWAY!",0
"Absolutely horrible teacher, worst I have ever had in my life I dreaded going to her class every day. She grades the first two pages of an essay and then doesn't read the rest if she doesn't like what she has read. Also on the day any major essay is due no matter the excuse she will mark you down 10 percent on the essay if you are a minute late.",0
"Absolutely Ridiculous. Way to much reading its as if she thinks that her class should be the center of our universe. We read 2 3/4 books, the whole books in one fricken semester. She is not helpful. I would never recommmend someone to take her. If you get her as a professor switch classes immediately.",0
"OH MY GOD!! Stay away from this professor!  I am in her class right now and I have to drop it.  The course average for EVERY student in my online class is below a 40%.  I spent 6 hours on one of her ""basic"" homework assignments, and had a friend with a MASTERS DEGREE in computer sciences help me with this homework, and still got a 65%. SHES UNCLEAR",0
We know you use a hair dryer.  What What What a hair dryer?  Great Instructor.,1
She was really cool i liked the way she talked.  She helped go over a lot of things with me and good to talk with,1
"I struggled w/ Math my entire life until I took Prof. Ball. He's accessible & cares that you understand - allows you to ask all the questions you need answered. Absolutely the BEST math teacher I've taken in my life! He breaks it down until you comprehend the material & is patient with you but most importantly, will not judge you for not knowing.",1
"I have always loved History Theory but Rob ruined the class for me and many others. He puts down students publicly, wastes our time when we have group assignments that need to be finished within 2 hours, and grades unfairly. He gives the same grades to students in group assignments that do nothing or do everything. He needs to fix this class.",0
"Dr. Goodwin has to be my favorite professor at Centralia College. She gives lectures that are easy to understand and provides plenty of example problems, which makes the homework assigned through Mastering Chemistry a lot easier. After taking a class with Dr. Goodwin, every other gen chem class I took at my 4-year university was a breeze.",1
"This man has pushed me farther away from engineering than even my parents' disapproval ever could. He has made me question every decision I have ever made. With his boring voice that is enough to put an insomniac to sleep, I've been unable to focus in any class. He is the WORST professor I've ever had, and that's saying something. Take it at a CC.",0
"Very intriguing lectures, and always brings in personal stories.  She does not lecture for the exams, but rather broad ideas. You teach yourself from the book. Easy to approach, and seems to care deeply for her students.",1
He is one of the most straightforward professors I've had my freshman year and his lectures are great. His tests clearly reflect his lectures and homework and as long as you take detailed notes on lectures you will easily get 100% on the homework and if you do well on every homework passing the tests will be easy. He's also pretty fun to listen to,1
she may be a brilliant playwright but she is far from a brilliant teacher.,0
"Stay away!!! Took her for two online courses and she is a very tough grader. Assigns discussions+comments every week, (not terrible) but she barely ever gives full credit for them. You NEED textbook for her or else she'll give low grades. 3 to 4 tests, makes you work for them. Don't miss assignments or turn in late ones. She WILL flag you.",0
Amazing professor takes the time to answer question and lectures are very interesting. Would recommend highly !!Tests are fair .,1
"He is great for BA 370 but NOT MIS 300. I am very positive towards learning, but I can honestly say, in this class I learned maybe the same amount I could have read on my own in two hours, & I'm avg. at comps. He uses the same tests of the professor who wrote the course. Easy 'A', but if you care to learn, doesn't teach well like he does in BA 370.",0
Don't take him. Worst profesor ever! 3 weeks to hit finals and the only thing I learn was football. I'm so disappointed.,0
"Ms. Mancini is a life saver, definitely one of my favorite professors at NOVA.  She will go the extra mile to help a student with anything.  I took her class online, which was a little extra work because you had to teach yourself, but she was really helpful and replied to all emails quickly.  I would recommend her to anyone!",1
Awesome professor! Very caring and room to improve grade!,1
"Funny, but lazy and class was an insane waste of time after the first test. If he didn't feel like teaching he'd just pop in a movie. Sounds easy but his tests were intentionally tricky to make it seem like his class was harder than it really was. Wouldn't take again.",0
"His notes are lack of examples, even some of them are not completed. Most of the content are definition and hard to understand. the assignments are so tough without a clear definition list or a lot of examples. he is not a good choice for math classes.",0
"This class is tough.  Homework is no cakewalk either.  SHOW ALL WORK ON TESTS, I didn't and paid the price.  Seems like many students did very poor on the first exam, below 50%.  You just got to work hard and ignor him if he is talking down to you.",0
"Very low voice, soft-spoken. Gets embarrassed when things aren't clear. Went over individual example programs in class. Let us write our own with guidelines for added practice, without grading. Not really able to clearly explain in simple terms. Fairly attractive.",0
amazing.,1
"Truly one of the most boring classes I have ever taken. Not completely horrible, but I'm sure everyone would just zone out or do other work in class and then just read the textbook before the tests because her powerpoints are useless. Get another professor if possible just because her teaching is so boring.",0
"Dont sign up for this class. RUN. Average exam grades are Ds. The only reason youll pass is because of the exam drop. If want to keep your 4.0, choose another class.",0
She is nice throughout the semester but does not give any updates about grades. At the end of the semester she basically gives you what she wants you to have. No matter how well you actually did on assignments. She gave our entire class a letter grade below what we actually had because she felt like it. Take her at your own risk!,0
This teacher was the most unclear professor that I have ever had. She was never avaliable if you needed help. YOu could never get a hold of her. She told me I was getting one grade then ended up with another. I know a few people she did that to. My thoughts are they could find someone better to teach an education course.,0
"There were a lot of readings (free online textbook and articles) and videos, but I learned a lot. It is not hard to get a good grade in the course if you follow the rubrics for the major assignments. There were weekly online discussion posts, an online quiz, a midterm assignment, and a final paper. She was very accessible via email for questions.",1
"extremely unorganized, but papers aren't difficult. Canterbury tales are the only thing covered. No theory or background info given on the text. Lectures are a bore, but he is apparently ""a very busy parent"" [like no one else is who teaches...] so he is rather disjunctive. 3papers. He canceled the final exam. You get pizza on the last day. Eh class",0
"An insightful class which changes your view of the world. Reading expected before class, amazing lectures with heavy note taking. Study guides for each exam, but get ready to study, exams have a lot of material that require lots of explaining. If you follow his guidelines to success in his class then you'll have no problem succeeding.",1
This professor is so rude. Not recommend!!!,0
"Humber is one of the nicest profs I've met, but I hated taking MATH 213 with him. He wasn't prepared to teach for two hours straight. I found his lectures very difficult to engage with, which was unfortunate because the textbook was not helpful either. His homework was really difficult, but tests and quizzes were easy.",0
poor explanation,0
I studied with this professor 11 years ago but she was the most dynamic and stimulating professor I had in undergrad.She encouraged the students to come up with ideas instead of stating all content herself and moved the lecture on by getting the students to make the logical connections leading to the arguments she was presenting in class.,1
I had him and he is very aggressive when it comes to the students; he uses his power to destroy the student.,0
I used to hate life drawing until I started taking it with Kathleen. I learned so much from her because she is so clear with her lectures. Every day in this class is dedicated to something different. She wants the students to experiment with different techniques and find what's most comfortable for them. Take her! You won't regret it! I promise.,1
"Judith is not a very nice person.  She plays favourites in her classes, and if you're not one of them, you can not do anything right.  I think that she teaches so that she has a captive audience to brag about her writing.  So she's a Canadian writer - she's not that famous - don't be starstruck. If that's all she's riding on, it isn't much.",0
He is possible one of the worst professors I've ever had. He is very bad at explaining topics and doesnt go over half of the clicker questions so its hard to catch up if you are behind. The only reason I go to his lectures is for clicker questions because I learn little from him. The class by itself isn't bad but do what you can to avoid having him,0
"An amazing professor, you will not regret taking his class. Even though his class was online, he makes it fun. He throws jokes in his writings and he gives good feedback. You will be graded based on you quizzes, exams, and assignments. One extra credit opportunity.",1
"I took him for Calc II, and would not recommend him if you're going on to take Calc III. I need Calc III and I do not feel prepared at all. I taught myself almost everything I learned in this class because he does not give good lectures. Not many notes, lots of example problems.  If you end up taking him, read the book before going to each class.",0
"Not a bad professor. Can get pretty long-winded.  Work was concise, grading was clear, and work was very manageable.",1
I really wanted to enjoy this class. Phelps is very opinionated and constantly contradicts what's in the book and DVDs. He will start lecturing about material in test 5 before you've even taken test 6 He is overly critical of the ONE PAGE writing assignments and is known to berade the class before passing out the graded essays. Very disappointed,0
"HORRIBLE! I could not wait to take Spanish but after her class, there is NO WAY that I am taking Spanish 2. This woman cannot teach. Talks a lot yet says nothing. If you aren't willing to eat,breathe and sleep spanish 24 hrs a day,then don't take Fletcher's class. This is THE ONLY CLASS you will have time for.Don't do it.Take Sign Language instead.",0
"Way too text book oriented, not up to date with current trends his knowledge begins and ends with two examples: coca-cola, and Toys-r-us. participation based on arbitrary facts like if you check your email in class, how professional you are, etc. has pop quizzes like elementary school.PHD in consumer behavior so he scrutinizes little details .enjoy",0
Amazing teacher best teacher I had in college. gives good feedback I would take her class again,1
"Good prof; very engaging and enthusiastic about topics and conversation regarding the course; can be a bit over-enthusiastic when this was a morning class, but overall easy to talk to and approachable. Would recommend for a research paper prof.",1
"Awesome prof. Extremely entertaining, fair grading, great guy- definitely recommend him.  I wasn't looking forward to the class, and it ended up being my favorite.",1
"You MUST read the book, you'll fail if you don't. Code not required, so buy used. All tests have extra credit (10 pts max) DO ALL OF THEM!! She answers all questions asked. Printed notes are okay, but reading the book helps you understand WAY more. Labs were fun, pretty cool stuff. You won't regret taking Prof. Sieber.",1
Doesnt explain things very well...,0
"Professor Stevens is great. I found Calculus class very difficult but she helped me to stay on track. She always responds to emails and answers questions in weekly forums. One can clearly see that Prof. Stevens cares about her classes, from neatly organizing Canvas and material to answering the students and helping them understand complex concepts.",1
"Without a doubt one of the worst teachers I have ever had, in one of the worst classes I have ever taken.  She has an extreamly annoying voice, and can't control the volume of it.  She says um at the beginning of almost EVERY sentance.  The worst 2 hours you will ever have to sit through!",0
"One of the best professors I have ever had. Introduction to counseling, you need to take it with him. Smart, funny and he knows his stuff. Two counseling videos are required and a summary of every chapter in the book he assigns which is 8 dollars. TAKE HIM",1
"You have you to take this guy for any class. He'll get you all ""fired up"" about accounting. Go to his office and talk to him just to say hi, he's so friendly! ""How bout that?!"" P.S. ask him where he goes shopping for his clothing.",1
"He is a great professor. He makes it very clear on what he expects you to know for the exams. The powerpoints are posted on moodle, but he goes into detail during lectures.",1
Get ready to fail this class. No matter what you do. No matter if you study 24 hours a day. At the end you will not pass the class. Really tough grader and very confusing. tons of homework and quizzes. you will get crazy of studying. Please Please Please do not take a class with him because you wont get good grades nor understand mathematics.,0
"Schilling's lectures are boring, but if you just do every single reading, this class is an easy A. Tests are all multiple choice, including the midterm and final, with some easy short answer extra credit questions.",0
"This was the worst professor I have ever had !!! She is very condescending, I would NOT recommend her at all. You have to go over modules by yourself and then come to zoom sessions and ask questions, if you need a professor that teaches then dont choose her ! Her mid term had 8 or more answer choices per question!!! WORST PROFESSOR EVER",0
"Only reads off the slides. You can download slides but is NOT very helpful. Funny Heavy accent when he says ""packet"", and hard to understand what he writes (scribbles etc)Go to his office & he will ask you rhetorical questions but he will help u in his office but is difficult to comprehend his teaching u the stuff. Take this class at own risk.",0
"Dr. Laflin doesn't really interact with the class, by more so her TA does, being Mr. Burkett. Burkett is wonderful and provides excellent feedback. You have weekly readings and projects (not hard at all though). No quizzes. 3 exams all semester. Do the work and you will get an A. Lots of extra credit as well.",1
Mr D is the best! lectures a lot but you dont even need to take notes because he goes over every question to the test a few days prior. homework is jusy busy work and he grades really fairly. get ready for a 10 page paper! you get to pick your topic so choose wisely. He is a lot of fun and i will be taking 2 more classes of his in the spring,1
I loved torts! This man is truly a character and you will only pass by truly reciprocating his exact instructions. Outside sources will not help you because he teaches through his own language. BUT BEWAREyour grade will only be based on the final! Outlining early is the key to success.,1
"Professor Noland is absolutely AMAZING. I was super worried about taking this class but she made it so simple! The assignments can be tough & a little scary, but Noland is HILARIOUS and super passionate about all of her students. She wants everyone to succeed in her class, and she makes that obvious. DEFINITELY recommend. :)",1
"Really a good class. TBH Im conservative and didnt expect much from the class, but felt like Dr Carter respects all students and wants to use anthropology to reach out. Like others said, he changes lives. the work load is what you would expect, and Patrick did a great job as teaching assistant. Always responded to emails and was v friendly.",1
Super easy class. Watched movies every now and then.  No tests at all. Lets you out super early. Not always straight forward but a super easy grader and lenient on late work.  Looking for an easy A? TAKE THIS CLASS ,1
"My previous review was deleted, but I still stand by my opinion that she is unclear with directions. I got an A, but her rambling instructions were frustrating. Also we didn't have the benefit of receiving graded work before submitting another report. Still, you can rack up pts on quizzes + exams, so at least that was objective.",0
"Power points are helpful, Go to class , study the questions in the back of the book easy A!",1
clearly he is writing his own feedback on here. sitting in front won't help. going to innovation lab or slc was only way I could understand it. not helpful. kept saying right... like everyone one understood what he head just said and the room sat there confused and shaking heads as he kept talking... get ready to hear him talk nonstop...,0
"A very good professor. Anyone who can't hack-it in her class is a joke. Easy class if do your part. Just show up on time, be respectful, and do your work. Compared to the demanding math and science faculty, though not her field, here at ccp, she is one of the easiest professors.",1
her grading system makes no sense and I have never had more panic attacks than I did this semester when taking her. do not take her. worst prof at westconn.,0
"2% chaque cours pour les travaux d'équipe en classe, mais on en a fait a peut près 5 max, donc 2% facile à chaque cours (pour un total de 20%). Il n'est pas très pédagogue. Ce que j'ai le moins aimé c'est qu'il va plus vite que ce que prévue au plan de cours et donc lorsque l'on prend un peu de retard dans les exercices c'est difficile à suivre.",0
"I have mixed feelings about Maureen... she was so helpful in pushing me out of my comfort zone with speaking in front of the class. However, shes a tough grader and has issues with time management. She cares about her students and will meet you at anytime of day or night. Get ready to not know your final grade in time for the final though....",1
I absolutely LOVE Professor Wheeler. She is very engaging and is an unconventional teacher because she doesn't give us slides of notes to copy down. There are discussion questions that she will have on the board and you will be able to get the answers from the discussions we have in class. The readings are all very interesting and I truly enjoy it.,1
"Lectures can wander a little, but the content is good and hes decently engaging. The concepts I learned in this class were some of the most interesting in my undergrad. The exam is pretty reflective of what he mentions in lecture, so take notes. As long as you work hard on the paper and go to class youll get a good mark.",1
"If you showed up and paid attention, everything was very simple. Makes it very easy for you to understand. Great teacher",1
"I thought he was a good professor! He was very interested in the topic he was teaching & I actually learned a lot in his section of the course. Because he is foreign he can be hard to understand at times.  I took Judiaism, Christianity, & Islam with him in which he teaches the Islam portion.",1
Most classes were a lecture presentation format. Weekly quizzes and discussions plus 3 out of class experiences were required. She is pretty flexible if you ask about deadlines and we played jeopardy a few times.,1
"New, but willing to learn.  Enthusiastic, and approachable.",1
"Positives: he grades on such a generous curve you're bound to get a decent grade. Negatives: you must show up for ALL classes to take notes, and he gives homework every day. If he doesn't like you for whatever reason he is extremely rude and disrespectful! My friends and classmates have told me I should report him to the Dean for what he's done!",0
"She assigns a ton of work. She is a nice person, but the comments that she leaves on your papers are pretty rude. She can come off as condensing.  There are so many papers and they must be incredibly detailed. She is a ridiculously hard grader. Like she grades you on participation (only professor I know that does that)  I suggest avoiding her.",0
(part 4) Pros(3): The final exam is non-cumulative. But the algae identification is cumulative.  Cons(5): He doesn't give any curves for the exam. He thinks giving the sample exam is a form of curve and he believes he is doing the fair thing eventhough many of those questions are a PITA.,1
You gotta WORK for your grade in this class 3 midterms and a final. Prof has at least 1 essay per test and final is cumulative. Difficult class but if u do the work u can pass,1
He is the most sb professor in BU. I take it for summer term but the homework is two times more than other class in regular semester. And we all think he has OCD because he just wants us to do everything in the exactly way he wants. I don't think he knows he can grade A in this class. I feel like my time is wasted and I did not learn anything.,0
Dr. Birx is a prolific author and an exceptional teacher. He pushed me to look beyond and challenged me on my suppositions. He was also able to shed illumination on a whole area of Anthropology that I overlooked. He was also available for questions and gave great advice!,1
"Good, fun teacher. Lots of homework and online confusion. Probably one of the better choices for this class. I would give her a B+; well worth the hassle.",1
"I would recommend taking somebody else if possible.  She has a split personality.  One day she will be cool and other days she goes into full-blown psycho mode.  I am not kidding.    She doesn't allow students to use laptops or cellphones to take notes or look up stuff to help out.  If you take her, good luck.  You are entering a nightmare.",0
"3 individual papers, 3 group papers/presentations, 2 memorization tests, group and individual online business simulation.  Professor creates an uncomfortable learning environment.  Half of the class didn't say a word the whole course.",0
Very interesting class. Great activities. Fascinating guy to talk to.,1
"very dull and boring, his time has passed. great guy, but not too effective on the educating side",0
Terrible professor. Guarantee he will not help you at his office hours. Boring class. A shame to NC State's CHE department,0
"She's a proud woman and doesn't deal with people who cause trouble, so knowing a little bit about Spain (where she's from) couldn't hurt... Anyway, I liked her. She isn't a hard grader but there's a lot of work involved (book work, online assignments, etc.), none of which is too hard. Overall, she's a good teacher and explains lessons very well.",1
I took this class in 2020 and I don't know if it was just the circumstances but this class was lacking structure and presence. Lectures were hard to sit through sometimes but it was an easy pass. If you are looking for surface level insight into the field consider this class.,0
"AP is one of the best professors Ive ever had at Reynolds. She makes you work for your A bit if you show up to class, be involved, stay motivated and respect her the way shell respect you, youll get an easy A. Shes always willing to help and give feedback, she makes English class fun and hands on. Please take her while you can.",1
"I honestly don't know if she's a good teacher or not. She was extremely late giving back work and grading assignments and didn't respond well to inquiries regarding assignments. Additionally, none of the dates or assignment values matched when looking at the syllabus versus the actual assignments. Really disappointed.",0
"She is very helpful, gives very clear assignments and good feedback. You can tell she cares about her students! Would definitely recommend her.",1
"Hw is myPhysicsLab, each time u get a Q wrong, it decreases your %. He will drop for attendance. Class time consists of 90% group work, before it was 100% lecture. Also, you need to read the chapter and take a reading quiz before each class on canvas imo they're hard. I wish he would go over worksheets in class more. You can use equations on test!",0
"Very caring, helpful & accommodating professor. Valuable to students entering the medical field. Lectures can be long but it's an upper level science so to be expected. She acknowledges they can be tedious. Focus on power points, study guide & short answer question prep for exams.  Labs are easy. No paper/presentation. Highly recommend her.",1
would only recommend this class if you really enjoy journalism and I mean really enjoy it. The professor is very demanding of how he wants things done and there is a ton of writing for this class,0
"Mary is the best teacher! math also isnt my strongest subject, but she made it so easy and enjoyable. i would definitely take another class with her again!",1
very easy to co-operate with,1
"The class itself was very boring and not enjoyable in very many aspects.  I learned more by reading the material than I did by discussing the ideas with both the professor and the class.  For English majors, a class with her is inevitable.  She may not be the most personable person around, but if you focus on academics, you should be fine.",0
Super boring classes but they always ended early. Three super easy essays and an extra credit essay. Hes not very nice but an easy grader,0
"Really great and rewarding class, I loved it!  You'll find your art improving a lot with it!  Teacher is very nice and helpful. You'll do just fine if you have an interest for the subject",1
You have to do the homework and show up on time this semester half my class dropped because it was too many papers like too many he should at least put it on the syllabus before because it would be better and gets mad that we couldnt take words from the class discussion for the mc notes he is a character mainly speak and you better be right,0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR IF YOU DON'T NEED TO! At first she seemed really cool, but come to find out there's homework EVERY WEEK, You have to type a 500 word journal 6 times out of the quarter, which is a drag. Has two midterms and a final. She has study guides for it btw. You Also need to participate or you won't get any participation points -.-",0
The best professor I ever met he not only professes the truth.. He has taught me about life. I learned about Sociological Perspectives and more.,1
He was not really helpful at all. He never gave us graded assignments back on time. He was disorganized and did not follow his syllabus. He graded papers way too hard for no reason. I didn't learn really anything in his class.,0
"Maureen teaches an amazing class, and her ideas are inspiring. But she is genuinely senile. She has so many things she requires that are ridiculous, takes forever to give back assignments. And she marks hard on the first assignment and then easy on the rest, somehow making it look like her students have improved when they haven't.",0
I study for this class at least two hours each night and still get test scores in the 60's and my scores are in the top 25%. My normal test scores are typically in the 90's. His handouts are not current and don't match the text material. It is difficult to cross between his handouts and text material.,0
"Class is hard but you can really learn a lot from him. Hard assignments and exams, but since it's advanced course this is expected. Very personable.",1
"Annoying, tons of work, and rude. Hard to reach and messy, unorganized syllabus. Don't take her. -1/10 for me.",0
"Meyer makes you think his class is really easy throughout the quarter, but then he's really obscure about how he grades. Basically, the only feedback I got was A/A- on the midterm and then he dropped an A- on me for the quarter even though I participated and was in class every day.",0
"He's incredibly boring and the material was dry. Read off his notes most of the time and attempted to make it interesting sometimes but not very well.. Could have taught myself better. Tests were pretty straightforward. Makes you use Connect which sucks, but it's pretty easy. Probably wouldn't take him again.",0
"Her participation grading - stupid. Claims the way she grades you for coming is rewarding but you buy an app and get legitimately graded. You could show up and try but get a 50 on the questions. Her quizzes - easy. Use google and powerpoints. Her ""business problems"" are rough. Isn't challenging. you wont get an A. Time consuming... Learned nothing.",0
Grades more grammer and writing than content. would not recommend this particular professor.,0
Dr. Beckman clearly has passion for his subject matter and inspires his students. He is the best professor from which I have taken a class. He is always helpful and will go the extra mile for his students. ,1
Really a horrible teacher had to drop math 112 from winter term. This class she doesn't know the material at all and student ask her if she supposed to follow the math formula in the text book and then she get mad and yells as the student. Really a rude instructor and bad at teacher math course. Please avoid taking this instructor for math.,0
"Prof Richards is the coolest, nicest professor ever! I took his class but then changed my major so I didn't need his class anymore but I still decided to stay in it because he has such a great teaching style and is always very organized! Definitely one of the best professors at DSU!",1
Great Prof,1
Poor time management. (Waited almost 3 weeks for him to post an online exam.) Very wishy-washy on the material he was using. Added a required book to the class with less than a month left in the semester. Also tells lots of stories. Im sure hes a hoot at barbecues but theyre mostly distracting and rarely relevant to the question asked.,0
"I have Mr. Kraft right now, and he is absolutely one of the best teachers I have ever had, especially for english. He is always willing to help with your essays and never makes you feel stupid. He is understanding if you are unable to make it to class and has a funny personality. He makes english fun and I would recommend him!",1
"This guy teaches for himself and not students. The class is devoted to his repetitive life stories. My class literally had to teach themselves. Leave during class he takes points off tests! How? He just decides to make questions on YOUR test worth less!!  O yeah, and he doesn't round up grades--I got a 79%. very unorganized for an accountant.",0
"I had him in high school, possibly one of the best teachers I'd had back then. Now I got him again, I purposefully took this class just to have him teach me again. Without a doubt I can say out of all my current profs he is probably the coolest one I've had so far. He is sarcastic, friendly, and he goes above and beyond. You cannot ask for better.",1
"She uses the ALEKS system, which means that you take an assessment in the beginning and then only have to study the material you don't ""test out of"". There's homework every week, but it's super manageable. Only the midterm and final are proctored, which is also a plus! (this class is also Pass/Fail, so you just need over 70%)",1

"Professor Nakaji was an amazing professor! You could tell she really does care about her students. Her methods of teaching ASL are really interactive and extremely helpful with learning the material. If I were to take ASL 2, I will definitely be following her to whichever college she goes to! Such a fun class, would highly recommend.",1
"Interesting topics but not worth it honestly. She is very passionate but lectures the WHOLE time, readings everyday, and only 2-3 tests with a good amount of papers.",0
"Once gave a pop ""TEST"" ""TEST that is"" NOT a pop QUIZ, ""POP TEST"". And his tests take like 2 weeks to complete. He should also be retired/gone since he sits in his office 70% of the time!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Not a bad professor.  Like the rater before said, it's just hard sitting through 2 1/2 hours of lecture at night.  Basically an easy A if you go to class and do the papers.  He is full of a lot of information though.  He knows his stuff and has a lot of real life experiences.",1
"His in-class assignments were a tad ridiculous, and the group project took a crazy amount of time to complete. He expects everyone to participate in the class, and would call upon people to talk if no one volunteered. His exams were really straightforward and fair. Textbook helped if you missed a class or were unclear on some of the concepts.",1
"Very helpful, clearly explains and won't proceed unless you understand. Allows corrections for half credit and he is very patient. This was my 2nd time taking one of his classes. I was really dreading Trig until I saw him in the class offerings. Totally recommend him for anyone who isn't math friendly.",1
"I really enjoyed this class. She was quick to respond to all questions. Went over all quizzes with me, so I would understand everything. If I didn't, she explained it in a way that was easier to understand. Few quizzes, then midterm, few more quizzes, then final, with some assignments in between. I really enjoyed this class.",1
He is the toughest grader I have ever taken. He gives a lot of homework and is really tough on the specific details required in your answer. He is the hardest teacher I have taken. There is a lot of drawings and answering questions.,0
"Awful professor. Can't answer anything on the spot and is rather unknowledgeable about most things (i.e., referring to PCC as PPC, or thinking methylene chloride is the same compound as chloroform). Apparently used to be a great professor until recently. Not very well respected.",0
"Zhao was a great professor. His class was only offered at 8am and that scared me, but he made me want to go to class. He reinforced my love for chemistry and although he has an accent, he was very easy to understand. He gives all of the information needed to do well in the class. He also gives major extra credit points. Also pretty attractive.",1
"Professor Smith is one of my favorite professors at UCSD! He literally wrote Constitutional Law for Dummies - there is no better professor to take a course about constitutional law. His courses are detailed and difficult, as he teaches them like he teaches is law school courses. If you are a POLI major, I would highly recommend!",1
"very good instructor. he makes everything pretty easy, he dumbs things down and make it so understandable. ur grade in his class is based on test alone. which is fine because they're pretty easy. anything in the med field is based on memory, so study the notes he gives u and u get an A, that simple. i'm new to the med field and he helps soo much.",1
"AWFUL TEACHER! If your interested in Asian art don't take her class--you retain notihng because she doesn't have herself together enough to be a teacher. She is moody, nasty, and really difficult to get along with. You will dread going to class! She grades unfairly, its all subjective. She puts down everyone-evn those who thought they were ""friends",0
"Barely showed up for this class & passed with an A grade. You can skip his lectures, but DO NOT SKIP review day! He gives his EXACT exam questions so be sure to write it all down & print it on his allowed 1-page cheat sheet. He doesn't check his homework so I just passed HW1 for all the homeworks and changed the name to HW2, HW3, so on. Easy A",0
"Online course, easy, but assignments were boring and ""worksheet-ish."" Almost no communication. Course VERY poorly designed: missing info and instructions, erroneus assignments/dates; she clearly had not gone through the material and had copy/pasted from a previous semester. Grading return time awful (over 6 weeks). Disaster of an online course.",0
"Ven is a caring professor who gives very good, detailed lectures. She is very flexible and knowledgeable. HW's are doable through following lecture, textbook, and other online resources. Midterm and final are similar to HW's. There is a short coding project at the last half, and shouldn't take more than 2 days.",1
The lectures were disorganized. 200+ pages reading a night before the class not discussed. Very tough grader. DONT TAKE HER CLASS.,0
"Just to clarify I emailed her and you're not allowed a index card on the exams anymore. Overall she's a good professor. Do your labs, discussion boards, and study the study guide and you'll be fine. Honestly I think its an easy A if you just put in the effort (not too much work anyways). You can't turn in late assignments, but you have extra credit",1
"Bushey is HARD. You must put excessive amounts of time in practice aside from homework, to get it fast and be ready for weekly quizzes. He also changes questions unnecessarily and makes it 10x difficult sometimes. He is unfair on time for quizzes, and leaves almost no value in understanding what we are learning, b/c of how fast you must finish.",0
I took Prof. Venus after being out of school for several years in a month long summer class. He helped advise me on questions i had when my advisor was not available. He sometimes went off track but usually found a way to skate back towards discussion. He may be more difficult if you have trouble understanding older literature. Participation HELPS!,1
"I've been performing for years, and I can tell you right now, he is definitely one of the best acting teachers I've ever worked iwth. he knows how to instruct you to really understand what acting should be about and what he teaches will make you a better performer. And hes funny as hell, and creates a totally comfortable environment. Hes such a bla",1
"Given that accounting is a hard enough class as it is, he doesn't make things easier. The exams are hard and he will randomly call on multiple people in class to participate.  He does very little teaching and makes you learn from your peers. Be prepared to put a lot of work into this class just to barely pass. He is hard to understand at times.",0
I think his classes are useless. I don't understand his explanations. He cannot be a good teacher!a good researcher? Maybe!,0
"This guy blew my mind. The class was extremely difficult for me, so I had to work really hard for a C+, but he loves economics and if you go to his office hours then you're definitely on his good side and get more XC opportunities. He tells the craziest stories in between lectures, how he speaks 7 languages, was in a refugee camp, etc. Very wild.",1
"Just an outright amazing professor. His tests are straight forward and not hard at all. You do have to read the book, but you are in college so this should be a no brainer. Good luck",1
"One of my top 3 teachers. I had her for Fairy Tales and Fables and I wish I was allowed to take that class again. The class was a very open discussion about concepts and it was a class that we could think in. Only had 3 essays throughout the class, and we had plenty of time to think them out. She's so sweet, and very easy going. Loved this class",1
"Personal experience and friends taking the course, he tells you what will be on the exam .... he gives you the complete opposite.  He definitely knows what he is talking about but is very boring in class.",0
"Karen is a great math teacher, I personally don't like math and have struggled with it in the past, but she makes it easy to understand and is always there to help.",1
He seems to have stuck with the same processes for years and has never innovated his teaching style or class format. The homework is incredibly straight forward and actually allows you to learn. The exams are a different story. He has no questions from either the homework or workbook that prepare you for the tests. 75 percent of the grade is exams.,0
"The class design makes grades heavily reliant on timed exams, which unfortunately are on applications of the assignments which no student would understand unless a student has taken the course or some equivalent before.  This places students who don't have the proper background at a disadvantage.  I learned a lot, but I'm worried about my grade.",0
"Compared to other psychology profs at uOttawa shes not bad. Her curriculum is fair, with a presentations and two midterms. But as a person, shes really unpleasant. Even though I performed well in the class and loved the topic I found it really hard to like the class",0
We weren't able to have his class face to face due to there not being enough room for social distancing. If you're not good at chemistry definitely do not take this class online. I struggled but was able to pull out a high B. 5 tests and random quizzes sometimes weekly. One chance for extra credit and its an essay.,1
She is Amazing. Very encouraging and helpful. I wish I could have her for my next math class.,1
This professor does not answer e-mails in a reasonable amount of time. He barely interacts with the class and his assignments are VERY incomprehensible.,0
"finished this class today and wow, I really don't care what I get. The class was made sooo difficult. just glad Im done. ",0
"talks/writes/moves very quickly, difficult to contact, homework grading is very harsh, tests vary in difficulty but he curves. relatively hard class, but i passed. not sure how much really sunk in, but i suppose i gained some sneaky reasoning skills...",0
I did not find this class helpful.  Most of the information we learned came right from a textbook.  We learned this material in health and wellness but have to take it for majors.,0
This class was ridiculous! I am a senior and a psychology major and this is by far the most difficult and boring class I have taken at UT. I highly recommend not taking this class!!!,0
You'll get use to his humor. He's a funny guy and made the material fun to learn. Get connect and start it. 50 questions on all exams except final is 75Q. Exams based on notes. Write everything he says and puts on the board. Curves n gives EC. He was my favorite professor and I enjoyed coming to his 8pm class after a long day. Highly recommend!,1
one of the hardest classes ive ever taken in my life. he is no help at all and will rip you apart if you make a mistake. he may be a very smart man but just dont take him,0
"She has a lot of personal experience under her belt. However, her grading is harsh, and her manner in class was very uncomfortable. For her I'm sure it feels like impassioned political discourse, but it comes off as mean and belittling. Unclear assignment criteria. Interesting but narrow range of topics discussed. Needs major changes to class model",0
"She was sweet and clearly knows her stuff . However, I found that she just assumed the students understood the topic. Hard grader yet she does give extra credit points. Overall , She heavily lacked clarity for what was expected during assignments . Without knowing what is being expected of you definitely makes it hard to succeed in this class .",1
"Tries to maintain a balance between liberal and conservative political interpretations, but is definitely left-leaning. She is open-minded about politics, but the care ethic is very strong in her. There is A LOT of reading for this class and so if you aren't inherently interested in the subject, take a different class. Grading depends on your TA.",1
He is a terrible teacher. Please don't take him. I had to drop. I don't feel like he gave me the chance to really appreciate the subject and topic. His exams have only 3 questions and are nothing like the 40 questions homework he gives you. He CANT TEACH! He will mess up your GPA.,0
The best Spanish teacher ever.  Easy homework and he gave a review that looks just like the test.. we even had extra credit on the test. He is very knowledgeable and HELPFUL! !! Easy A!,1
"very bad teacher , no examples",0
"She is a very nice teacher and I think she does care about the students in her class. But she doesn't go over the material well enough in class. She always lets us out early, which to some of u might be a good thing but when u are trying to learn about managerial accounting and she keeps letting you go early all the time, well thats not too good. H",1
THIS class was absolutely amazing. He gave you multiple chances to redo papers when you didnt recieve the grade you thought you deserved. He makes you think and opens your mind to so many things you never thought about. He really explains things extremely well. This class is the highlight of my week!,1
"CLASS WAS A BREEZE. SHE IS A GREAT PROFESSOR. STUDY, STAY CAUGHT UP ON YOUR WORK AND YOU SHOULD BE FINE.",1
"Great class! Professor Wood was very helpful, the class was fun and engaging. She encourages you to communicate, work in groups, and build friendships. She also teaches you key steps to get past your fear of public speaking. I would highly recommend her classes, if you pay attention, participate, study, and communicate you should do well.",1
"Gives you samples for midterm and final, similar questions. Online quiz and homework, easy A if you are following, attendance is mandatory first several classes. The book is not required.",1
"Christina is a really cool person, but if she doesn't like your piece then you might as well just turn in a totally different piece. She is also pretty unclear of what she wants which can be good in art, but in this case it didn't work because she wanted specific things. I took Color Theory and I don't think I learned enough about color in class",1
"If you're in his class for Quantitative Methods, I have only one piece of advice for you. GET OUT NOW! How he is qualified as a teacher is beyond me. You will not LEARN anything, but you will pass his in-class tests very easily. Beware come exam time as the only thing you will only have learned how to copy off others. Ho' Boy, Enjoy... ",0
"Dr. Schmurr is such a great guy! The material he teaches is hard sometimes, but hes open to helping, and also allows a lot of corrections. I would highly suggest choosing him as a professor. Also, as long as you go to the class 50% of the time, youll be fine. He doesnt take attendance.",1
"I hope that I could give 0 for him. For those who have to take this class, do it wisely. Write your letters clearly, cuz he took points off because you did not write '2' or '5' properly. He also can not read your exam if 'x', 'z', and 'y' is in printed format. Very stubborn , impossible to argue with (about anything). Argue for grade? Take care!",0
"I believe she is a good teacher, she mostly reads out of the books but expects you to do your own work and be ready for test on all books. BUT over all was an easy class as long as you do your work. EASY TEST!",1
"She is a TOUGH COOKIE! This class is hard if you don't put in your all. If you want to pass this class with an A, I recommend doing everything she tells you to do. She will try to intimidate you by picking on you and blast you with tons of questions. Believe me, when I tell you to study, study, study! Good Luck!",1
"Probably one of the easiest classes Ive taken. You get discussion assignments per chapter, along with quizzes per chapter. Quizzes are straight forward. We had 2 groups projects, 2 major exams worth 100pts each, again pretty easy and straightforward. She gives feedback on assignments which is great because it allows you to correct any mistakes.",1
For the Leopold book just copy the 4 articles in the back thats all you will need. He is an awesome person and extremely understanding if you cant turn something in on time. Keep up on the readings he will stop reminding you to do them so the syllabus will really help. ,1
"More than half of the class got D's or F's and Dr. Stone confirmed it in an unprofessional letter to the students. There is no mathematical curve in this class. So if everybody gets below a 60% as their final grade, they are all getting D's or F's. And he said doing the homework and easy quizzes are count as a curve. Avoid this guy at all costs!!!",0
"Such an easy class and such a cool prof! His assessments are very easy and his lectures are a lot of fun. Only downside is he has no clue how to use mycourses. If you miss a lecture there are no slides or anything to learn from, that content is lost to you forever.",1
Avoid at all costs. For context I am in the honors program and was a straight A student. Ive had hard profs and classes before. But she is a gpa crusher. She doesnt care about any student. Terrible teacher. Wont learn and will be punished for it. Avoid this professor,0
Not sure how this guy has such a high score. He did a terrible job explaining lectures online and they were short and uninformative. He included stuff that wasnt really covered on exams and homework. Maybe he does a better job in person :/,0
"Terrible teacher. Gets off topic during lecture, and highly subjective grader. By the end of the semester the teacher did not input at least half of the grades i received in the course, only the final letter grade two weeks after taking the final.",0

she is a good teacher but she is kind of crazy. It is hard to understand her because of accent. but she Is pretty good,0
"My second class with AR. Ok, let's put the looks aside because she IS a looker and focus on her teaching style. As a teacher myself I found it too research oriented but in this case that's exactly what I needed. A researcher of her caliber would be perfect for grad students. Less sure about undergrads. Overall high marks.",1
"I would take her again in a heartbeat. She was caring, easy, and nice. Get the books or not, it's easy understandable things. Highly Recommended. Very clear.",1
I don't recommend her if you need extra help. I couldn't understand her very well and her method of teaching made it extremely frustrating. She likes to do the hard way before she shows you the easy way and won't fully answer your question. Even if you're good at math i would still hesitate to take this class.,0
"THIS PROFESSOR CHANGED MY LIFE!! He is amazing. That class was so interesting- i actually looked forward to going to class. I did not do any of the assigned readings, rather i paid attention during lecture and I have an A+ in the class. it is not an easy class unless you pay attention(luckily, he's intriguing). I will miss this class.",1
"you will get out what you put in for his class. his exams aren't easy but they are in no way there to trick you! he clearly and thoroughly goes over all the reactions in lecture, and if you need more explanation, he is super accessible and thorough in OH and via email! don't fall behind, study in advance, and attend OH to reinforce tough concepts",1
Pretty good teacher. Really helpful with any questions. Really wanted to help everyone learn and succeed. Not a big fan of the final project in Adolescence class but other than  that pretty good class.,1
"She is literally the worst teacher I have ever had. Her unprofessional and hostile attitude are sort of shocking level. In my opinion, this program, especially in the clinical part, does not constitute and organized well.",0
No Comments,1
Your best bet is to use Khan Academy or some other online resources and just use those over relying on the book or lecture too heavily. He says the book isnt student friendly then proceeds to read directly from the text. He took an hour to do 4 examples and a quarter of the class left after the following 5 minute break.,0
I was horrible in math and with this class I made an easy A. Gives one extra credit opportunity. Dr. Brown is very sweet and willing to help. He always makes sure everyone understands before moving on. Best math teacher at AUM!,1
"Orgo is going to be a hard class no matter who you take, but MS is a solid choice! He makes jokes that really aren't funny but let you relax a bit in class. If you want an A, be prepared to study at least every other day & go to GSS - it's so helpful and way easier than teaching yourself; I probably put in 10-15 hours a week for an A. 80% was an A",1
Great Teacher!,1
"Bar none the worst professor I've ever had.  He repeats the same stories over and over again and his exams don't reflect anything that hes taught in class.  Be prepared to teach yourself anything that you need to know from his classes, because he sure as heck isn't gonna teach it.",0
She is a  tough grader. I  won't take any class with her in future . She really wants that student get low grades. Pre Calc is  easy but she made it too hard.,0
I with I could assign Margarita higher than a 5-star rating. This is an incredible instructor who knows exactly how to work with language-learners. I want to keep her in my life to practice Spanish in such a beautifully non-judgmental environment... Not to mention the fact that she would be an awesome person just to spend time with.,1
"Great professor.  The class is easy if you read the assignments and study for the tests.  She is very helpful when it comes to inderstanding the readings.  As a class ask for a study guide for the tests...she will give one!  She also brought in coffee, apple juice, and bagels on the day of the final! Looked forward to going to class!!",1
"Class was easy enough. Weekly writing assignments and three research papers. No tests. I'm not too sure about the grading system though. I got an A- with a 95%. Not sure what this is all about, but it's my only real complaint.",0
I finished this class with 108%. Quiz and exam questions come straight from homework! Maybe numbers are changed. Lecture is super helpful and great explanations! All you do is examples and the material really sticks. Very good at explaining! Lots of extra credit opportunities. Quiz each week: 2 questions. Two midterms: 5-6 questions. No surprises,1
"Professor Foster was great to have and I wish she taught French 102! There will be homework everyday, but it's definitely worth it. She had fun exercises and games that helped with learning the material through out the book, which you will definitely need! Attendance is also extremely necessary to be successful in this class!",1
Horrible,0
"To sum it up, Vannozzi was the absolute worst professor or teacher that I have ever had. He expects you to pass everything in on time, or you will lose 50% of the grade, but it takes him more than a month to pass back homework. He is impossible to make meetings with, he is unclear in his lectures and just does not know how to teach. DO NOT TAKE",0
An awsome teacher. Can sometimes ramble in Japanese and lose you but overall she's an awsome teacher. And HOT!!!,1
"Professor William reminds me of a second grade teacher, while she is extremely upbeat and always has energy, her lecture do not help to understand what she is teaching. Most of the time you are teaching yourself.",0
First of all its hard to understand what she is trying to say because her English isnt very good. She makes things harder than they needed to be. Yes she lets you use all your notes and past homework on exams but they are not helpful at all,0
I am not one to complain about a professor but this guy is AWFUL. Not only did I teach myself everything he is a nasty disrespectful guy. He would choose certain students and pick on them. During the year all the hours of packets and chapters in Lab Manual don't even count towards your grade. Your end grade it strictly tests. Try to avoid this man.,0
"Actually a pretty nice guy, obviously very intelligent.  Doesn't really cover test material in class, though, and you rely heavily on former tests that he posts.",1
"To keep it simple... I received an average of a 74 with Prof Conner for Intermediate Algebra. The next semester in College Algebra I got a 95. Wasn't a fan of her style, pace of the class, or patience. Went at her own pace and got annoyed if you asked her to work out more problems to help you understand.",0
If the class is online expect to teach yourself most of the material.. The examples shown in lectures are no where near how hard the exam questions are.,0
Professor Fan is a good professor she goes over everything really well to make sure her students understand. I would say make sure to go to class every day and pay attention because it will make it a lot easier for yourself since she explains all the concepts in class really well. If you chose to skip class then you will have a harder time...,1
He was one of the best professors I have ever had.  He is very straight forward and doesn't ask for much from the students.  His tests are MC and if you know the notes you will make an A on the tests.,1
"What a horrible professor! Unorganized, ill-prepared, unfair & rude...I actually had to go to her boss about a grade b/c McClung can't figure out how to give a peer review assignment. Tried to give me a 0 b/c no one would send me a paper to review! Her boss sided with me. Grades VERY harshly & I have my doubts about if she even reads the papers!",0
Dr. R challenged me to meet my potential. She is tough as nails but sharp as a swiss knife. Outstanding researcher and great fashion sense)))) Oh and she is soooo pretty)))) Definitely a role model for women in research professions,1

Professor Yemut teaches straight from the text book. He lectures 2 hours straight. Lets u leave 30 min early. His tests are hard. He does offer 10 points extea credit and drops the lowest test grade. I was .2 ponts away from a B �� wich sux.,0
"WORST PROFESSOR EVER! so much work, lack of interest; can come off as rude..take someone else!",0
This man is very sweet but very out of touch. Online teaching is definitely not his format of choice. He rambles a lot and I found myself doing better by not attending lectures.,0
If you don't have your notebook you've basically failed the class.,0
"I took a native Spanish, and I thought it was going to be easy. I was wrong. He is a tough grader, gives homework, regular papers, and group work. All in Spanish. He is a tough grader, and takes attendance. If you take him, don't slack off.",1
"really tough grader, extra credit is only worth one point. She is not helpful when you have concerns about your grade and has a very smart way to respond, always. since her english isn't so good, her lectures are not understandable. Do not recommend her.",0
"It's true that you may take it for an easy A, which it is, but b/c she cares, you will care as well. You will ACTUALLY become friends with the people in class because it is all discussion based, so be ready to talk. There is a lot of reading, but it can be skimmed easily. Assignments involve going out into DC to experience culture & write about it.",1
"Where to begin *sigh*. I'm a solid student, I make A's. She makes it IMPOSSIBLE to make an A in this course. She does not hold lectures, only Zoom/Webex meetings once a week-which are impossible to get into if you have a life outside of school. She is snarky, she's very picky with how she grades, and you basically teach yourself everything.",0
"Dr. Hill is there to watch you succeed and she will move mountains to make sure you understand the topics. There are discussion forums, labs, quizzes, and extra credit opportunities given. She also looks into her student evals to improve things for her next class and takes them with pride. Loved her as a teacher",1
"Bit on the timid side, which some students take advantage of. Other than that, great professor! Art history lectures are hard to stay awake through sometimes, but the hands on, creative aspect of the class is very enjoyable.",1
"Absolutely horrible professor. Completely unorganized, has no understanding of the concept of explaining assignments. Terrible at giving instruction and when asked for help, she's totally vague and doesn't help at all. Would NOT recommend this prof. Take another class.",0
Don't ever take him. Its a terrible experience.,0

"Hands down worst professor I ever had, talks down when people speak up in class ""The class room is a place to learn, not a place to ask questions"". Very unclear as to what is being taught during class, 1/2 of the content she lectures is about china and nothing to do with the course outline. Highly recommend to NOT take a course she lectures.",0
"I Took Abnormal Psych Advanced as an independent study for my Bachelors's. Just a suggestion when you get her book start reading the book and begin answering the questions through the chapters; they are either in red or blue boxes depends on edition. Not consistent giving feedback on the papers, made it clear to me she is VERY PART TIME.",0
"Legend and likeable. The one freebie class first year. Easy assignments, but you don't learn much.",1
Prof Sigal is great. He's far from the stereotypically boring history prof. He really encourages you to be creative which is refreshing. I took his course on colonial Latin America and enjoyed it a lot. Whether you're taking a course in history to fulfill a general req or for your major I definitely recommend him.,1
"Pat McKean is an amazing professor. He gives you major insight to what it is like in the journalism world, so if you are interested in being a journalists take his class! I did not buy the book and good thing I didn't because he went over the important info in class.  There are many assignments but if you do them in a timely matter you'll be fine. ",1
"Get Chegg. Very abstract, non-linear teaching. Your quiz and lab report grades rest on your group members, so hopefully they actually participate for you. Attend every class, even the shorter, non-lab days.",0
"She's great.  At first, she comes off as intimidating, but she is actually very easy-going and approachable.  She tells you exactly what you need to do to receive a good grade in the lab.  Some of the experiments are tedious - obviously not her fault",1
"Professor Swartz may seem scary at first but he is just trying to weed out students who don't belong in hard STEM majors. I took his Chem lab 2 semesters in a row and he honestly is a teddy bear once you get to know him. He will not explicitly give you answers but help you to think in a way that you come to the answers on your own. Overall, great.",1
"she is terrible when it comes to writing notation, does't accept homework once class starts, says an answer is wrong when it is right, basically impossible to do anything correct.",0
She is a super awesome and hip teacher.,1
Don't take her class! was super excited to learn HTML but was slowly ruined by this prof. She signaled me out to always answer questions I didn't know and wouldn't take that as an answer. She's not helpful and I just learned HTML on my own time because it was easier than learning from her. This course would be good if there was a different prof...,0
"She does not provide study guides. She is always late to class but requires her students to always come to class and be on time. She lectures to us as if we have a degree in Biology already. Every time you ask a question her response is 'Well, what does the book say?"". She is a nice lady but a HORRIBLE professor. Please do not take her seriously.",0
"Mrs. Noland is an amazing teacher. Shes super funny, very easy to understand, and she makes it easy for you to do your speeches. For someone that has extreme anxiety for speaking infront of other people, this class was a breeze.",1
"Terrible terrible teacher!! Very disappointed with her teaching methods, tests are hard and confusing I can't believe I ended up with a D I wouldn't take her again!!",0
"First day of class then dropped out. Discussion heavy, heavy reading, expect to write  3-4 pages of reflection papers. BEWARE",0
"I took his online class and it was great. I recommend listening to his lectures, writing notes, and memorizing pictures...that's all and you should get an easy A/B. I will warn you that his lectures are boring, especially since I have a short attention span, but don't worry..you can always fast forward to the important parts but dont do it too much",1
"He's interesting in lecture sometimes, and I'm sure he's a cool person. He's just not a great professor. He rambles on, doesn't stick to the plan he has for his own class, and your grade is very much weighted on tests, which aren't even well written. Questions are worded weirdly and most of each test is based off the last night's reading.",1
"Linguistics in itself is not the most interesting subject, but Barret does try to keep people interested. He presents the material very effectively and is always available for extra help. He gives lots of hand out (not a lot of note taking!!) and his test are easier than the homework. If you can do the homework you'll get an A. I'd recommend him.",1
I enjoyed D. Dyers class. His lectures were great and helpful. He gives Webassigns and assignments roughly once a week that are usually pretty easy. The hardest thing was the short projects but they aren't worth much. Overall if you put in the work it's not a hard course.,1
"Great instructor & class! Liked the quizzes & assignments, but the long tests are challenging if you are a slow test-taker, because they are 100 questions long. Learned quite a bit in this class.  It's to your advantage to read the material which is interesting.",1
"LA is a super chill prof. I honestly did not go to many of the lectures because she posts the slides that do have most of the information she talks about already on them. 4 online quizzes, an essay on a Canadian criminal (interesting), and a final. You definitely need the textbook to do well on the quizzes! 100% would take LA's class again.",1
Took online mini-mester for this class. Professor always gave updates and frequently sent messages to students. Very approachable and is quick to answer any and all questions. Very active online.,1
Professor Trubatch was not a good lecturer. He would write things on the board without explaining what he was doing and would often just mumble while facing the board. When he did try to say something he sometimes wouldn't even finish his sentences. He never used examples to explain a topic which is necessary in a math class. Avoid at all costs!!,0
"The best english teacher ever. Read everything he assigns because there will be quiz. The content of the class is boring but he makes it so interesting. Take good notes, read, participate!",1
Mini Term B. Class was difficult because of all the packed info for the 6 weeks. Out of 5 exams drops the lowest grade. Lectures are all over the place; studied straight from PPT for the exams. 14 labs/drops 2 - labs are easy. No research paper.,1
"Worst professor I've ever taken. Please, spare yourself from this course. I didn't learn one thing and he uses the same exams each semester so everyone cheats. Not about that type of laziness.",0
"I failed his class, It was super hard and his exams was hard also. will not take again ",0
"The only people who could possibly give this fantastic professor a bad rating are the unintelligent ones. Hes extremely clear about what you need to know, as borne witness by the thousands of times you'll hear him say 'so what this means is'. He gives you precisely what you need to know, and clearly loves anthropology.",1
She is kinda nice but she is the worst teacher on campus. The class is a waste of time and not worth the work. If you have her you might as well just drop the class to avoid the headaches of her insane projects.,0
Genuinely caring professor- the best :),1
"I took her online class.
 One annoying thing is the old assignments that junk up the pages and sometimes the tests don't work.  There are also brief reports due with each chapter. 
 She is very unorganized. Not reccomended",1
ten out of ten would never take a class with her again. she prides herself on failing pretty much every student on their first essay and takes forever to hand back the essays. she can be very rude and tough on students by calling them out and then humiliating them. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS IT IS REQUIRED FOR YOUR MAJOR.,0
"The best professor I have had at City College. Yes, a lot of work, but if you dive in and do the reading and assignments you really learn a lot. She is easy to engage with and learn from, and this course (and her others, I've taken a few) is worth while. I always feel satisfied when I finish the readings or an assignment.",1
"DO NOT take her class. She makes it very difficult. She gives too much work, so if you do plan to take her, take her class by itself!! She doesn't explain things she just simply reads from the powerpoint.. and when you ask for help on a lab she tells you to refer to you lab partners when the whole class don't even understand what to do.",0
"He was pretty awful! I have been a strait A student my entire life with only a couple B's in H.S. and none in college so far till this class. His expectations were confusing and made the student feel stupid if he did not like the work. I get A's on my English papers, but got a B- on what he called a ""quick and easy assignment."" Avoid if possible!",0
Professor Swint is a great and fun teacher! Class is not mandatory but if you go and he gets to know who you are he will def. help you out with your grade! I don't really like american gov. but he makes it as interesting as he can! Take his class!,1
"Great teacher and great person, but the only way you'll do well in this class is if you're a good student and go to class and pay attention. He lectures really well and often goes over things multiple times to make it clear, but the problem is that a lot of students (including me) don't like accounting and tune out. Final was pretty hard.",1
"Absolute great experience with this professor. While he can be a little strict when helping you with code, you can tell he genuinely wants you to learn. His lectures are very well organized and he gives real world examples. His assignments are very manageable and I felt like I walked out of this class with a lot of gained knowledge.",1
"Has a great personality. Wants his students to do well, wants student to participate in lecture. Makes sure everyone understands the information and is available for help outside the classroom. Tests require memorization and final is cumulative. Easy A, would not take economics with anyone else.",1
"Bertram is the most fast-paced a&p professor I've ever had. I've taken an a&p series before and this is one class you do NOT want to rush through. He barely goes into depth about anything so be prepared to study. He does give some EC though, but his tests are TOUGH and NOT what he lectures on - VERY detailed. He's pretty much all over the place.",1
"I understand both students and professors are having a hard time with COVID. But even now, this guy is still such a harsh grader and is still teaching religiously by the book, exceptions are very limited. Even if wifi is hard to come by, Zoom attendance required. Difficulty for exams and labs is ridiculous, pls cut some slack for your students.",0
"Lee is a nice person. He's very brilliant but cant explain the material that clear. He tries though and if you asked him about something, he is willing to take time and help you. Easy class overall!",1
"She sets a very distinct criteria from beginning of semester. Tests are hard&worth a lot. She curves down for her tests so if you get a 100 on the test after the curve it will be significantly lower if the curve is large. She did not seem understanding when I emailed her about a personal issue, hw on mindtap for every chapter. Not an easy A",0
"Easy A, but you actually learn in the class. She has a lot of guest speakers that actually teach you things you should really know going out into the world. She gives only a midterm and final, but goes over it with you before you take it. She also assigns 2 papers that are opinionated based and short.",1
This class was alot of fun. He makes the lectures fun to listen to and easy join. Tell lots of stories that relate to the topic at hand. He's there to teach not too grade so showing up and participating are a sure way to pass yhe class with an A or B.,1
Best Spanish professor at CLU! He wants you to learn the language and creates the best possible environment for it. I've struggled through Spanish 101 and absolutely dreaded going to class. Not the case here! I actually enjoy his lectures and the in-class assignments.,1
"This is probably the most funnest and interesting class Ive taken at Baruch. The instructor is really creative and good at capturing attention and I didnt feel like the readings were busy-work or pointless. Dont get me wrong, its a lot of work but its not particularly hard.",1
"It sucks that her classes are always so late at night. Tests and quizes are a pain in the neck (weird wording, asking you for the answer specifically from the book or lecture). Generally has a dog in class which made my semester with her bearable.",1
"Don't know much about him as I took the course online. Seemed pretty vanilla, just basic computer stuff. Class was moderately difficult but routine and pretty much existed within the SAM program.",1
"It's hard to pay attention but try. Generate class discussion amongst your peers, otherwise it'll feel like you're being strung out and left to die of awkward boredom.",0
"Took the WebCT course. Disorganized and unclear with instructions, Prof. Popovich fail to respond to your question in a timely manner and when he did finally respond the answer mada no sense to the question you had asked. I would not recommend this class unless you have no choice.",0
"He's so loud, eugh. He gives you 2 or 3 abstract assignments with no clear directions. If you're a novice Adobe user, good luck, pal! He won't go over the programs much in class, & def. won't teach you. Whenever we had class (he canceled a lot) he would just go on rants. (not useful!) Pro Tip: When he critiques, don't talk back. It can get uglyy.",0
"Erin is a good professor who wants her students to do well. Plus her tests are all multiple choice. You'll still have to study, but it's easier than any written tests I've had. My only complaints are that there is a LOT of info to go through in Micro (not her fault) and the class moves fast, and she has a valley girl voice (you get used to it).",1
"One of the BEST Instructors I've ever had. She speaks definitely, absolutely and with much enthusiasm about her expertise! ",1
"Honeslty she is very disorganized, she is a nice teacher though. Now, the lectures are very different than the tests, which throws you off, she is also a tough grader on lab papers, will take points for everything.",0
"I disagree with all of the negative comments. I am in no way smart enough to take philosophy, and I found his class dead-on. His class is relaxed, and there is no pressure to participate if you don't want to. The TTh classes are a little long but he always gives a break.",1
I hate every day of it.,0
"I tooked the 115 and 125 class with Mrs,Wells. Very good teacher be prepare to do lots of homework. you want an ""A"" she will make you work for it. Her lectures are very clear she is very passionate about her job and helping her students.I would take her for all my math classes if I could.",1
"Kelly Roe is a great professor! If you have the chance to take her, please do. She is young and fully willing to go every single problem for you. Her exams can be harder than other professors but the class average will be around a C+ so work hard and you will be okay. If you go to her office hours then you will learn everything you need to know.",1
"The class consists of heavy reading work, weekly reflections, and an overarching group project that is based on the idea of creating a well rounded lesson plan. Note that this is a foundations course, so it was my first ever lesson plan. We were verbally torn apart in front of our class for 10 minutes. Still got an A but it was not a pleasant time.",0
"Professor Esposito is PHENOMENAL!!! He is extremely passionate about what he teaches, and I adore his ""pathos"" during lectures. Everyone who gave him a low rating probably didn't put in the effort to do well in the class. He is the best and I would take him again 100 times if I could. Loved this class!",1
He never uses the chalk board  and never have any helpful exercises. He don't give direct answers and if you ask him for help he tells us to go to the SI student help which: I feel should be the teacher. He is very forgetful and act as if nothing is wrong. He can speak spanish fluently but is not a good teacher.,0
"Hard to understand. Hard class, lots of homework. Just not my kind of learning",0
"The guy is a total scatterbrain, he lost several of my assignments.  He mostly follows directly from the readings but the prompts for the papers are often vague, confusing, or just poorly written/worded.  Overall, he has a very dry and far from engaging speaking style.  I would NOT recommend taking this class with this guy.",0
Solid instructor. Wish he would do more difficult examples of differentiation on the board. Don't forget your minus signs!!!,1
"Kim is a nice and down to earth guy BUT he never answers emails, he confuses himself when he talks, and he goes through the lecture so fast. The class is a teach yourself course and half online. There are three tests, 10 connect HWs (one extra credit), and different assignments here and there.",0
Great teacher. Is willing to help if you have a problem and shows interest that he wants to help,1
I loved Dr. Pittman. She really cares about her students and will do anything to help you out if you put the effort in.,1
Worst teacher ever. Somebody needs to fire her! She needs to mind her own business!,0
Really genuine and interested in making sure everyone understands the information! And very open to suggestions on how she could make the class more enjoyable and clear.,1
"Mcentie is a jerk. He rarely communicates you, and seems to not care at all for his students. Even for a community college this guy's a joke. The course is already bad, tied in with a terrible professor is just a bad time. He's not clear with what he wants in hws and essays. Just throws boring lectures and textbooks and expects you to be an expert.",0
"Mr. Prey is one of the best teachers I've ever had. Yes, his tests are hard. You have to study, and do so regularly, but you will make memories. You will learn a lot, and you will get out of your comfort zone. I had a tough time with the content in this class. There's a lot to learn, but he makes it as easy as he can, while making you work for it.",1
"he cares a lot and will make sure you don't fail, lots of extra credit because it's a tough class. Lectures can be confusing. Don't need textbook. Good teacher.",1
Honestly this professor seems very good at first. I grew to find that your success is not her top priority.  She is very very strict with criteria and is unclear with instructions. She will kick you out of lab for very minimal things like forgetting to retype a revised procedure. Personally I would avoid this professor unless you are perfect.,0
"She was one of my favorite professors. She pushes you to write your best and also engage with readings. She is organized, sweet, and accommodating. You'll most likely have homework every day but they're always relevant to what you're doing. She's also a tough grader but will help any way she can. So all in all, do you best and you'll be fine.",1
"fels does not know what she is teaching, our class average for midterm exam was 45% while other classes had 60%. for the final, she put a short answer while no other class had it, she also made us watch 2-3 hours of youtube videos and study all case studies and noother class had to. she also counts 5% of participation mark for tweeting",0
She does not stop lecturing the entire class. It's impossible to take notes because she goes way too fast. I had her for an hour and 15 minutes and it felt like she didn't even take a second to breathe. LECTURE ONLY. No type of interactive learning at all.,0
"She's a great professor. Grade relies heavily on participation in class. Some online reading modules required, but you have all semester to do them. One individual essay, one group project that takes up a good portion of the semester, and a group essay for that project. She gives individual grades so don't worry if your partner isn't great.",1
"In 102, there is daily homework and a lot of exams and you need your textbook all the time, but Erin was enthusiastic about getting us through the material and I felt prepared for the exams. good TA and always willing to answer questions",1
Dr. Avila is awesome. If you want an easy A don't take her class. But if you are a fair student who studies then you'll have no problem. She's really nice and super sarcastic. It's funny. Everyone loves her. Great teacher.,1
"Don't buy the books, rent them just get copies of the Leopold articles it will save you some $$. Attendance is not mandatory but you will miss some important notes. The group activitis, the bus tour and the game are fun. I learned a lot. Exams are hard. Lots of reading and must be organized for this class.",1
"I would not recommend Professor Jewell to anyone. She does not teach much or give  helpful information, or relevant information. She loses papers and gives you a zero grade. Doesn't help with research paper assignment - you're on your own. Doesn't answer emails and is not accessible to students.",0
I took astronomy in high school and attended almost every lecture for the class but it was still extremely challenging. Reading the chapters and taking notes in lecture was a breeze and I felt I understood everything until I would get my tests back! Very nit-picky grader for an introductory class and tests basically make up your entire grade.,0
"This teachers teaching style is different to say the least! 95% of the time he goes of topic and rants about the history of... or what he deems interesting facts! Overall, not much learned from class, extensive amount of work! Long and teedious! This class is not for the weak of heart!",0
Dr. Ba is an amazing professor! Very clear in his expectations and understanding in that people have lives and things come up. W?He was more than a professor he went above and beyond to help his students!,1
"Everyone told me this class would be hard before I took it, but I liked this class. Its not an easy A, but if you do your work and do better then the majority of the class then you can get a B or an A. My biggest advice is to study daily. Otherwise he is very helpful when you need him.",1
Finished with 107 avg any questions??,1
Ridiculous teacher. She acted like you were interrupting her if you came to her door during her office hours and was overall kinda rude.,0
"Doesn't explain his lecture slides well. TRies to be funny in class, but the only thing funny was our grades when we get the results back. Lectures are unclear, quizes/tests are ridiculously hard, avoid if u can.",0
Difficult to understand.  Lecture rambles and has many different topics.  Easy grader.  Really nice guy.,1
Mrs Shan was great. Very much enjoyed her class and was not to difficult. Just engage with you weekly legal essays and pass the 20 question tests you will not have an problems.,1
"Super nice, funny guy, but not good at lecturing. Examples given in class and in Sapling are WAY easier than exams. However, study the practice exams for a good idea of what to expect. WARNING! A lot of unseen problems pop up in every exam so there's a limit-unless you're really smart.",0
Very funny guy and interesting class. Exam material is straight from lecture so this isn't a class you can skip (much!).,1
"While Dr. Leflouria is a good professor, I felt as if her class was overtly opinionated. I thought I had signed up for American history, but the class I took should've been more appropriately titled American History (of slavery). The subject matter was interesting &you will know ALOT about slavery at the end of the semester. Not an easy A ",1
"I took her for Specialized Professional & Advanced Writing and for Editing. She is the best teacher I have ever had. She is a hard grader, but you will learn so much. She keeps it interesting and  cares about her students and them doing well. She provides you with every opurtunity to succeed; you just have to take advantage of it. Must have book.",1
Harddddd class. Hardest of the series. If you can make it through this class the other two in the series will be a piece of cake. Don't get on her bad side :),0
"Took him for the 4 week session. Lectures can be heavy. Their is a practice exam, you must turn it in for points (majority of it is word for word, multiple choice on the actual exam). Labs are easy and somewhat fun. Also, lab exams (easy). Book was not needed. He was pretty chill. I recommend him if you need to take Bio 3.",1
"She was very unclear with her instructions and her syllabus. The second day of class everyone lost 10 points for not doing an assignment that we were not told about or was stated clearly on the syllabus.
 She also plays favorites and picks on other students.",0
"He understands that math is not everyone's thing and makes the effort to answer any questions you may have before, during, and after class. He gives great organized lectures and tells you exactly what's going to be covered on exams. (Also, really funny)",1
Dr. Ayers is a very good teacher. Friendly and approachable. This course helped me a lot in developing a business plan.,1
Respect him he will respct you on a one to one - very angry with mood swings - He will talk about everything and anything not b/c he is SO intelligent but because the man likes to listen to himself speak and tries to make himself look good.  He makes stuff up!  He thinks he teaches but he doesn't - BOTTOM LINE: DO NOT TAKE HIM,0
"Professor Mizell is more into current events than the actual material you need for the class. You might as well take this online before you take her because nothing you do in here is relevant to the essays you turn in. She's constantly wanting to start a debate. Also, she has never once replied to any of my emails. If possible take someone else.",0
"Mark is an awesome teacher. He grades pretty tough and u are expected to do every homework assignment and lab in order to even pass his class. Do not expect to just breeze through his class, because u will fail. He makes u work for ur grade but he is always there if u need his help and he really wants u to succeed. Would recommend for COM 408!",1
"Lipson seems like a good guy, but, quite honestly, his class was boring. 100% of classes were lectures, and there were few times for discussion or in-class assignments. He is super thoughtful though. He prepared thorough study guides for every test and they are very helpful. This is a polisci class, but lectures were more biased than I expected.",1
Great Teacher,1
"Dr. Jaja is very serious about her work and teaching. She is extremely knowledgeable and pushes you to fully understand soil science. Although, her class was difficult, I had a great experience learning about soil science.",1
"This course is very exam heavy. 85% of the total grade is composed of 4 exams(including final). However, he goes over in the lectures every type of problem you may see and emphasizes the content you must know. Because of this the exams are not very challenging: I got 100's on two of them. This was the best professor I have ever had.",1
"He is HORRIBLE! Do not take this class! He has a syllabus, but no due dates, and he expects you to submit things on time. Then he does not remind you if something is due.",0
This course needs to be revamped prof anikovsky needs to learn to teach stuff more throughly and test stuff that he actually taught us. literally buddy goes and tests on stuff he skipped in 10 min and is amazed that we did so bad. I am so happy to be done with this course.,0
This teacher is so nice! I don't know why anyone would not want to take her. She is willing to stay after class to help you if you need help or you can stop in her office. She tells you what's going to be on the test so you can study what you need to study. I would recommend her to anyone. She brings treats for the class at times to. Loved her!!!!!,1
"I loved every minute in his class.  I had him for calc 1 and 2 and part of 3.  he is very clear and understanding and if I had any more math classes I needed to take, I would make sure I had them with him.",1
"Stephanie is a terrific lady and tries her best to make lectures interactive and fun.  We had online open book/note quizzes usually every week, but they were difficult if you didn't read beforehand.  Only two tests, a midterm & final, and she gives you great study guides.  She also uses a lot of the quiz questions on the tests, which makes it nice.",1
"Most amazing professor I've ever had, usually when the professor is a literature fanatic they would get lost in the world of their own thoughts while explaining about the work, Prof P not only introduced awesome works she also guided us through with passion and encouragement. I'm totally not a Lit person, but I've definitely enjoyed her class.",1
Overall a very good teacher. She will explain things 100x if needed and never gets mad. She gives a lot of tests but that's the only thing you have to do in this class. So no hw or assignments. You are required to get the textbook but you don't have to use it because she gives all the same info in her powerpoints.,1
Very Very tough if you are not an english major.  Do not take this guy lightly.  He definitely helps you write for the reader.  If writing is not your strength DO NOT take his class.  Otherwise he will improve your writing dramatically. BE ORIGINAL and interesting!,1
"This guy's class ia a joke!  I would not call him a teacher, but rather a mere facilitator.  There is no input from him or any of the other professors that ""teach"" this class.  The class is pretty much run on auto-pilot with virtually no involvement from the ""professors"".  Useless busy work - This is from someone that got an A!",0
"Honestl dont know how people even rated this man nicely. Literally his lectures are way longer than needed to be. Everything they talk about honestly doesnt help, just do it for the pop up quizzes but wont help for exams. For exams you really need to do a lot of practice problems from the textbook, not from his recordings. Really rude, and arrogant",0
"I am an accounting major, so this was my first and only course on religion. Dr. Ramey is a wonderful professor. The class is set up with a small amount of lecture, and a lot of discussion. Dr. Ramey really makes you think and question everything you thought you knew about Islam. I highly recommend him.",1
"Horrible teacher.  I skipped 1001 because of my ACT scores, and I dropped this class right after midterms.  He gave me a 0 on m first paper because my criteria was not clear enough, and a 0 on my second paper because I used the word ""they"" instead of ""she.""  I do NOT recommend him to anyone.",0
"One of the best professors hands down, makes the class super clear and her enthusiasm she brings to class makes class enjoyable. Take her if you get the chance!",1
"My all time favorite professor a Case. He's hilarious and genuinely enjoys teaching and making an impact. He goes above and beyond as a professor to make sure he's students have a valuable experience. Take whatever class you can get with him, you'll be doing yourself a favor!",1
"GM is an even tempered folksy adjunct whose lectures are a walk through the textbook examples. Minimal mandatory homework & detailed preview of what to expect on tests means no surprises. He is available for help before & after class, in math lab, or by home phone. He does his best to accommodate late additions. I don?t know how this gets better.",1
"Completely useless teacher. I came out of the class with the same level of drawing skill that I had going in. He will state that he dislikes your drawings without actually telling you what specifically is wrong with them or how to improve them. I received back one graded drawing that just said ""This is problematic""  on top of it and nothing else.",0
I've taken two classes now with Dr. Poole and I've enjoyed my experience both times. Read the textbook and be familiar with the concept and you'll be able to pass with flying colours.,1
"He is an excellent teacher who gives his students mnemonic and analogies to memorize even the most difficult concepts. With him, anatomy and physiology was fun. He remains my best professor so far. I recommended him to many of my friends and they all attest to his good job!",1
"Phil 101 was super easy with Stockton. He doesn't take attendance, and other that the 3 tests, the only work you have to turn in is notes when he calls for it, and it's extra credit. He has a learning assistant that holds review sessions right before the tests that are almost verbatim of the tests which are super easy anyway. Super easy class",1
"Professor Mizell is a very nice lady. But she doesn't teach AT ALL in class, all she does is talk about current events. She hardly ever replies to your emails when you need her to. She does make a good syllabus that is clear and easy to follow. Overall, she's nice but not a very good teacher.",0
"Mrs. Young is so understanding & gives multiple opportunities to keep a good grade. This class is fairly easy to begin with, but she explains the material clearly & gives a chance to ask questions or seek help at any time. The final exam can be exempted if you have an A at the end of the semester! She doesn't count attendance but expects effort.",1
Lecture heavy but good class and easy,1
"Super engaging, and understanding. Attend class and participate in your group to get the full experience. Explains topics really well. Fun lectures and a great person!",1
"This class was difficult but like all foreign language classes it takes time and effort to earn the grade you wish to get. Attendance is mandatory and it's also necessary that you do online homework daily. Overall, he was a fair grader and expects a lot out of you as a student.",0
"She is an incredible proffesor, her lectures were always clear and got to the point . She has office hours on a weekly basis. She allows you to turn in late work because she prefers you to truly understand your work and she allows test points to be made up by doing corrections.",1
"He is a delight. You can tell that he enjoys what he does as well the the topic. Tells great stories , very approachable and engaging.",1
"Cramer gives really great lectures, he's a great eloquent speaker so definitely come to class and pay attention. The exams are hard-- studying is required. As long as you pay attention and take good notes you'll probably get an A.",1
"Constantly late to class and lab. Easily distracted and rarely stays on topic. Poor control of class, so students are constantly talking over him. Be prepared to write fast, notes are long. Quizzes are easy and so is classwork.",1
"Teaching Economics might be Prof Luallen's second job, but he never treats it like one. He is fully committed to making his students understand the concepts. Additionally, his lectures are presentation-heavy and fast-moving, but he takes regular pauses to ensure clarity. He is funny and has a self-perception of being stringent, but is very helpful.",1
One of the worst teachers I have ever taken. If you ask what's on the test he'll tell you everything. I used everything under the sun to study and did horrible in class. Lab was okay he was more of a person in lab than in lecture. DO NOT TAKE HIM unless its your only class and you can memorize the book!,0
"The best professor that could ever happen to biochemistry. Biochemistry can be very challenging with the material, but he makes it very clear what he is expecting and is very passionate about making the material understandable. He is so sweet and makes time for study sessions and office hours so you can get the extra help. 12/10 recommend",1
"Terrible prof. Can't understand her English. Had to do difficult calculations, but no one in the class had a clue how to do them. No textbook use, just her lectures. Like a lot of other people,I dropped. Don't take her, and especially not for this class.",0
"I don't know why so many people have Dr. McCartney so highly rated. If you have her for Tsem drop it, hardest class I've taken ever. 5 mandatory novels to read and she assigns so much work that she can't get it graded and returned. Aweful class all around",0
"I am going to school to become an actor and this woman is the best instructor I have ever had. She is full of life and passion. She is always there for us, she pushes us, and encourages us to give 100% at all times. Not to mention, she is one of the most inspiring people I've ever met as well. Honestly, one couldn't ask for a better teacher!",1
Dr. P gives TONS of examples.  Funny lectures with videos and group discussion.  Comments - almost seemed like she wrote more than I did.,1
Never again.,0
"You can tell Tchaprazov wants you to succeed and he's an interesting guy to listen to. You have quizzes after a few topics based partially on lecture, but mostly on the reading, which he goes over in detail in class, and the readings are all stories or poems so it's not bad. You have a paper on the end, but he's a really fair grader!",1
The class is really boring. And he doesn't really teach much besides reading from the book.,0
She's great as a person but our grades were based on two major group projects that I wasn't expecting. The first one she chose our groups and it wasn't great but overall a solid teacher,1
Not as bad as prior comments make her seem. Its a hard class and i DO NOT recommend skipping lecture. If allowed to make not cards keep up on them and organize. Keep with it and she usually gives a little extra credit towards the end if in lecture. I got a B so if i can get a decent grade most people who at least try can too.,0
"A very heavy course, but taking it with Dr Rogers makes it a lot more bearable. She is extremely passionate about the subject, and makes it hard for you to not be at least a little interested in it. Even for someone like me who went into the class dreading chemistry.",1
"This class is a decent amount of work, very manageable, however the teacher is very rude.",0
"The professor is very kind and always pauses class to ask for questions. Unless you are interested in the subject, the class is very boring. You spend most of the class/semester looking at weather maps on pressure and temperature. Try and make friends at the beginning of the semester because at the end of the semester you have a giant group project",1
"If I had the option to describe this class in one word... it would be HORRIBLE. Tests are super hard, attendance is MANDATORY so if you miss three or more times, you're down to an 80% for attendance. She is not helpful and gives horrible lectures. I would NOT recommend her whatsoever. Save yourself and do NOT take the course with her",0
Hands down one of the rudest professors I have ever had. I have never met any professor who is so rude and seems uninterested to teach their students. He truly seemed like he did. not care if we learned the subject or not. He said that calc 2 was the hardest math class yet he said we need to teach ourselves. He did curve a little at the end.,0
"I was overly disappointed with Professor Freeds English course. I took her class for my English capstone, looking back I really wish I selected someone else besides Freed. Hopefully this post can help people to avoid this Professor at all costs. Freed is a nice person in general, but when It comes to being a good educator she fails miserably.",0
"This class is extremely easy. All the homework is online and you can do it as many times as you would like. The actual class time is a lot of youtube and reading the vocabulary words in the specific chapter, so not very helpful. You really have to teach yourself. Tests and quizzes are extremely easy.",0
I really enjoyed his class last semester.  the stories always went along with what he was teaching and they really made the subject more interesting to me.  I wish more professors had some real world experience so they could be more interesting.  The notes are easy to follow if you go to class.  If you spend some time studying them you'll do fine!,1
"Not as hard to understand as most seem to be saying.  She does a ok job at explaining, although she sometimes misses the point of some questions all-together.  Of the other calculus teachers at Shepherd, I would recommend her the most.",1
"For someone who has worked in mental health, she sure has a problem practicing what she teaches. She does inteigue students and make them care and even listens to their concerns. But she will also make little comments that she knows will hurt students the most.",0
Takes her class way too seriously. Better teachers for this class. Nice person but way too strict. Give NO leniency at all. Isnt the type of person to let you make up things. Give no leniency towards attendance either,0
She randomly calls on people and isn't clear with her questions. Biggest issue is she tells you that she's giving a test the day before you have it. Lots of homework that she never checks and doesn't really give credit for - its hard to find incentive for all of the work assigned,0
"Dennis is a respected artist, but should not be teaching. He shows up 15 minutes late everyday and sometimes takes attendance sometimes doesn't. He gives everyone a B as long as you show up and try. He tells you to watch videos on the internet if you want clarification on anything. He plays on his IPad all class long. No demonstrations ever.",0
"Professor Hart was very scattered.  She never showed up to class on time.  She would make up our assignments during class, and would change topics frequently.  There was a lot of reading assignments and discussions involved.  Many small assignments could help your grade if you knew what she wanted.  A long paper was the bulk of your grade.",0
Sarver puts a 20 point curve on every assignment and test. Not because he is easy but because all his quizzes and test are very hard. He didn't use the book but expected us to read the chapters and understand it without using it in class. The tests went way more in depth than the notes ever did.,0
Really mean,0
"Great Professor. Not an easy A, but there are plenty of opportunities to bring up your grade. She does require you to learn Spanish. Uses many teaching techniques and in class activities. Very fun!",1
"Really funny guy. Clear, simple powerpoint slides. Do all the questions assigned in the ferguson book and you'll be fine.",1
If you put the time into the class you can easily get a good grade. He gave us a study guide for every exam and if you study that and go over the homework questions you'll do great. Overall I thought he was a really good teacher.,1
This is absolutely the greatest teacher in the world. She is very specific about what she expects you to know and will go into greater detail with you about anything you have questions about. Test are cake.,1
"He is nice, but I wouldnt take OChem at OC again. He doesnt know his stuff enough to answer questions at all.",0
Great guy and good teacher .Plays real loud.,1
She was a super great ENGL 100 prof! She gives very good feedback so you know exactly what you are doing wrong. She had a weekly forum or zoom meet (you only had to do one). There was a lot of reading but it was worth it and the essays are fairly open topic (lots of topic choice). She also answers emails within a day.,1
Professor Lusk is AWESOME. I enjoyed her class very much. She takes the time to make sure each student understands the material before tests and quizzes. It is helpful to at least skim the book before class or at least before tests. She made the point system very fair and clear.,1
"He is a nice guy  but lectures are long and boring and he goes off on tangents too often to follow. Exams are tough based mostly on what he says in class, hard to know what to study.",0
"Dr. Holtan was a really good professor. She did a good job of explaining the topics, and she played videos from tv shows that helped explain the material. The class was fairly easy, and while most people did not read the textbook, it helped during the quizes. She was a tough grader on the two presentations we did, but she offered extra credit.",1
She gave out an excessive amount of homework and kept pushing a liberal agenda. Every paper was and even the homework assignments were graded tough. Would not recommend to any one.,0
"She was very disorganized, and would come up with assignments at the last minute, but she explained things well, and by the end of the semester, I could understand her easily when she conducted the class in Spanish.  She would talk a lot about her life in Spain, but it added a really interesting cultural component.",1
"Yeah she's a great, easy teacher  and all. But she's the worst if you want to try and make up a test or anything like that.",0
"DIFFICULT. DOESNT USE POWER POINTS VERY MUCH. KINDA JUST RAMBLES MAKING IT HARD TO REALLY KNOW WHAT TO STUDY, OVERALL HE ISNT TOO BAD,",0
"This class was one of the best online courses I have ever had. Others have said it is an easy A but I do not think that is a correct description. If the A was easy, it was only because you completed all of her assignments and participated in the discussion board. I loved the way the discussion board is an open forum for everyone. GREAT class.",1
Lectures come straight from the textbook. Takes attendance through plicker questions but doesn't expect you to attend every class. Homework takes some time but some questions from the test are word for word from the homeworks. Don't really need to participate in the lectures. Overall easy/average class and average teacher.,1
I have been using rate my professor since my freshman and never made a rating. Until now because Professor DBH is amazing. She will go the extra mile to ensure you get the best grade possible. It is a writing-intensive class so papers have to be done. Easy A!,1
"She did a video presentation at the beginning of each week, but did not really explain anything just read off the instructions that we can do, not really going into depth. Also, didn't really answer the questions on the discussion boards, I learned the answers to things from other students in the class. It was not clear what her expectations were.",0
alright,0
"Please try to find a better english teacher. Professor Hetrick loves the sound of his own voice and will talk for an hour and a half straight about his job at USD and the drinking age. I went in for help multiple times and emailed him repeatedly to get almost no help on improving my essays. I wanted to improve my writing, but I learned nothing.",0
Great stories and pretty entertaining. Class is fairly easy and you don't have a book so everything is straight from notes and lectures. He loves talking about study abroad programs and has been to what seems like every country. When he talks about a region he usually has pictures of himself in these locations so it keeps you interested for sure.,1
"He's a cool guy, I'll give him that much, but he just isn't the best teacher. He gets distracted a lot. He also doesn't explain the criteria for assignments very well or clearly. He didn't seem to be that concerned with helping out his students, you had to hunt him down if you really needed help. Overall not a horrible prof, but not great either.",0
"Had Kraszewski back in the mid-00's(!) for Honors Lit.  Even now, I can still remember him ranting about the computer being an, ""evil Satanic contraption.""  :D  Anyway, the guy is amazing as a prof - knew 4-5 languages, and could make dull subject matter come alive.  Seriously, he is a walking wealth of knowledge, and very effective as a teacher.",1
Maybe he is a better teacher in person but I have learned very little from this online course. Some problems are explained through videos but many of the videos are extremely confusing and unhelpful. Plus $80 for mandatory WebAssign membership even though the point of City College is to be free/cheap and accessible to all. Worst online course imo,0
"He was so bad I had to drop his class. Grades quizzes and exams only, assigns homework, but wont grade it so it cant help offset a bad exam. He is nice, but his lectures are confusing to the point it looks like he has never taught. I talked to ex-peers and they all told me he is pretty bad and were at major risk for not passing.",0
"Seems to not be aware that this is the 21st century and that everybody has phones and needs them for different, but important, things. Also incredibly petty and likes to gloat about his past. Loves to bemoan class about not remembering every detail of the notes. Do not recommend taking his class, but if you do prepare for misery and a bad time.",0
"He is definitely one of the friendliest professors at Pace, and wants nothing more than for you to get an A and understand the material. His lectures are packed with info and he teaches using a lot of different materials, movies, stories, etc. He bumped my grade up from a B to an A at the end of the semester just because I talked to him.",1
"This class is a nightmare.  She is very bad at explaining abstract concepts or presenting the ""big picture."" The only thing more useless than the lectures is the textbook.  It will take a LOT of outside work to do well in this class.  She is VERY nice, however.",1
"In a creative writing class, she is a really good professor albeit stubborn and at times rude. She knows the craft very well and she does a good job engaging with your poetry in a meaningful, helpful manner. However, as a teacher she is a bit disorganized and can be a harsh grader. If you are not on top of your work, do not take her.",1
Great at making lectures interesting. Genuinely cares about her students. Put forth a little effort and you will succeed. Great for both science and arts majors.,1
Love this guy! He is such a nice teacher always taking the time to make sure everyone understands before moving on and explaining everything crystal clear! I wouldn't mind taking another math class with him,1
A hard class.,1
"He's informal and laid back, but super informed and intellectual.  My writing definitely improved a lot, as did my understanding of politics and how to read carefully.",1
"I can honestly say he is the best prof I've had so far. He is approachable and always happy. He makes difficult concepts easy to grasp. Only class that can capture my full attention because the material doesn't seem too intimidating when introduced by him. Exams were fair, and the ""curve"" is very generous.",1
Hes awesome! There is no way you could fail his class! Easy A!,1
Doesn't actually teach the material. Just reads over her slides and expects students to get it right away. Does not seem to put a lot of time into this class. Generally nice person but it seems like she has other things to worry about other than her Soc 201 class.,0
The best professor I've ever had!,1
"Dr. Walker is amazing, her teaching style allows the content to stick. She relates the work to real life experiences. She grades very fairly and is always willing to work with you as long as you are acting putting in the work. to top it all off she is willing to listen to any problems you might have school related or not. she is all around amazing!",1
AMAZING TEACHER! Very helpful. She expects a lot of her students but she is always their if you need her. Very knowledgeable on her subject and gives real life examples. Very interesting class!,1
"She is a great professor and she taught me so much about wine. Her class is low stress and if you have any questions she is more than happy to help you. Attendance, two midterms, three short online quizzes, a short paper, a presentation, and a final - that's the entire class. Take Enology 15!",1
"I was nervous going into Behavior Stats or PSYC 258 at Miramar College. Never had a solid foundation in mathematic, however Professor Lawson does his best to give everyone a shot at moving forward from PSYC 258. You will have to do your reading on the Chps. however he gives you in depth info on what to expect on the test and reviews every chapter!",1
"He makes you buy a book that you will use only one, just because he wrote that book.",0
She is an amazing teacher! She loves math and knows how to explain it. Makes it easy to ask questions. If the whole class does bad on a pop quiz she will give everyone the opportunity to get a better grade by going over what we all missed. I wish she taught all my classes! Be there and do the homeworks and the quizzes and you will do great on exams,1
"The red flag not to take: he wrote the textbook, refers to himself in it many times This course is doable, just a lot of hoops to go through for a 200-level psych course (if it was listed 400 level - ok). The caucasity really shows when he calls tai chi a ""slow motion exercise"" but Wikipedia lists it as martial arts. Sends pass agg emails.",0
"One of the worst profs Ive had. She rushes through her slides, and does not give nearly enough time for students to write down what shes saying - let alone understand it. Took two five minute breaks during the lecture, which seems nice at first, but then has to cram material in at the end of the lecture. Her exam questions were very difficult.",0
"PSY 220 IS about the psych of learning. In this class you learn that punishment is ineffective. Ironic. If you do not get every single thing right, youll have to redo the entire assignment. To get beyond a D, yes a D, every assignment expects perfection. A class literally about learning, this was the antithesis. 400 level work for a 200 class.",0
"Great teacher, but tests are over the top. I'm used to getting 90+ on a test that I study decently for, but with her tests, I spend two days studying and wind up with mid 80's. But she knows her stuff, is very helpful, and gives great feedback.",1
"Well, TO ALL STUDENTS TAKING instructor Yalan xing, turned out to be a nightmare more so rather than a learning experience, please take this as a warning before signing up for any of her courses, IT'S NOT A JOKE, It's your GRADE! IF YOU DECIDE TO IGNORE MY MESSAGE AND GIVE HER A CHANCE, PLS DO SO IF YOU EITHER, REALLY KNOW CHEMISTRY/ WISH TO FAIL!",0
"Only gave him a ""1"" rating because they don't let you rate ""0"".",0
"Took the class online and thought it was easy to pass. You upload your speeches online. Weekly tests, discussion postings and written assignments - none are too tough. If you do the work it's a no brainer.",1
"Fortunately she's often busy talking about things off topic rather than assigning class work. This class is very simple. Dr. Pittman should learn how to take advantage of the use of the online assignment submissions to avoid so many printed paragraphs throughout the sememster for, it is 2019 and printing every assignment is no longer necessary.",0
"I thought he was horrible, i also thought she was the worst and mean teacher ever there, she thought she knew everything but in reality she didnt know a thing. if you dont have to take i wouldnt take her if i were you.",0
"One of the best professors I've ever had, I hate history classes but she actually made me interested and kept me awake. What makes her such an amazing professor is you can just tell how intelligent and passionate she is about what she's teaching. Highly highly highly recommend her!!!",1
"Kubota sensei is on top of it!  She keeps us engaged as well well as stimulated!  She reviews and repeats, which some people complain about.. but that is what learning a language is all about!  She is very funny and very nice.. and totemo genki desu!",1
"Was a very difficult professor, but massively beneficial in that respect. Gives the toughest critiques, but also the best. Can be confusing; often changed grading criteria and requirements as projects went on, often at the tip of a hat or at the end of a project. Very experienced. Extremely hard, but extremely informative and educating.",1
She likes the whole new-agey interactive teach each other type of style. The rare times she lectured she was wonderful (VERY charismatic) but it's mostly group work. Lots of test questions end up hinging on technicalities or her interpretation but don't panic. PARTICIPATE and  demonstrate you know what you're talking about and grades will follow.,1
"Not the worst teacher in the world, at least compared to what I've heard about last semesters. But holy cow I don't understand the point of this class, everything he's gone over has already been taught in previous CS classes, so you just sit there while he over explains things that other teachers taught in four minutes that takes him an hour.",0
"She's Awful Awful don't take her if you register her class for now drop her today is last day to drop classes ,",0
Really hard class and is not clear in his lectures would not recommend this class at all.,0
He puts all the readings and films you need for the class online for you. He assigns several articles or chapters from books that he expects you to read between classes. You also had to watch the film out of class. He is a tough grader for the quizzes but is not so tough with the papers which was a boost to my grade.,1
Professor Xian takes a lot of pride in her work. She goes above and beyond to answer all questions or concerns from all students.,1
it is near impossible to get more than a B in this class. He taught the material poor inna more complicated way then need. He gave an extraordinary amount of homework that barely pertained to class and his test problems where kinds of problems we have never seen before. He let us use our phones (yes our phones) and were all still failed. DONT take,0
"Had to get a tutor because this professor is dry, boring and scattered. Gives lots of homework and quizzes which is great for learning- except he gives one or two question quizzes where the questions are much more difficult than anything he went over. He changes his weights at the end of the semester - I went from a b+ to a C. Horrible",0
"Excellent cours et excellent prof sur le plan académique, un peu plus discutable sur le plan humain (dommage pour un prof de sciences humaines)",1
"I took Professor Gibson for Creative Writing and for the Octavia Spencer Selective Authors Course. She is truly the reason I pursued my interdisciplinary english career in African studies, and expanded my understanding of poetry and African-American history. She has seen me through sicknesses, broken bones, and struggles! She never gave up on me.",1
"Prof. Dagenais seems like she cares about the course content and is interested in students opinions. She struggles with her hearing impairment and I think some days this does have a negative impact on her, which is understandable, however her lecture style is very dry, often runs over and she faces the slides rather than the students.",0
"There was a lot of work to be done in this class. I liked that she let you work ahead. If you emailed her on a Sunday, she got back to you in a couple of hours. I would take one of her classes again.",1
"Dr. Lane rules! Lots of work, but makes you think! And, yes, hot!",1
"I loved having Mrs. Kurtz as a teacher this year! She is very funny and silly when she needs to be, but serious enough for class. I greatly enjoyed taking this math class from her and would highly recommend taking from her!!!",1
Tons of work! She has misguided priorities about what is important to teach.,0
"This teacher doesn't require textbooks for this class, with that said expect to have art supplies, and spend some money. The projects aren't hard but just time consuming, in one project you can easily spend up to 24 out of class hours on one project. Teaches useful principles to art design regardless of degree field. A great class to take.",1
"After orientation i felt i would do well. Then i forgot  about the 1st exam which was due 4 days after orientation. She wont reset a test if taken 2 days from due date. Must take exams early to receive help with resetting exams regardless of whether the site crashes or you get locked out.  --stupid rule, she should be available att all times.",0
"He's a great professor that really cares about his students. He is one of the best studio leaders for DCM when it comes to feedback, but his project statements are almost never the same as the rest of the studio and he makes constant changes to what he's looking for in your drawings. Be prepared to have some late nights but you'll be better for it.",1
"The assignments were quizzes/exams (mult. choice) & short written assignments. The quizzes/exams came from an online textbook from connectforeducation. Though it was a late-start class, the workload was very manageable. Nothing's proctored, so take notes before quizzes/exams. Not much interacting w/ classmates/professor, so self-motivation is key.",1
"just close your eyes God knows. what a nightmare, lord have mercy on her future students and may she be forgiven for wasting students' time.",0
"I absolutely loved taking French 052 with Marielle! She was fun in class and was always happy to explain a concept more clearly if a student was confused. She was very passionate about the material, and she has a great sense of humor! I would definitely take another course with her.",1
Currently studying for this final and I really don't think I'm gonna make it. At 2 on the dot he walks in dims the lights and begins lecture for the entire class time. He is not good at lecturing and makes no effort to get students engaged. His voice is monotone so it's easy to zone out. He seams like a good guy but the class is a struggle.,0
"The class is interesting compared to others and he tries to make it fun. Most of the test is short answer so take notes in class he does not try to trick you, everything was went over in class.",1
Expects you to know everything. Difficult to understand and knows most of the class does not get it and still does not try to make us understand. If asked a question he will only repeat himself and make you look dumb. Horrible Prof.,0
Professor Heyborne is the man! His class was tough but manageable. He took time to explain difficult concepts and really made lectures interesting.  He cares about his students success. I have seen him several times on campus after taking this class and he still knows my name a year later. One of the best here at SUU.,1
He's great! His side stories are interesting and keep you from falling asleep. I really enjoyed his lectures despite not being the biggest chemistry buff.,1
Mr. Prunty is an amazing teacher. He takes the time to help you if you need it and all her lectures are clear cut and there's no way you wouldn't understand them. I'm bummed he isn't going to be teacher 101 next semester he is really awesome and I would definitely take him again. It's really hard to fail his class.,1
"I thought I'd be really bored with Ger Media, but Prof Oosterhof was a really good professor, by far the most understanding prof I've had during COVID. She actually meant it when she said she understood we were stressed out from COVID and didn't want to overwhelm us. She would get our feedback and switch the schedule and assignments around for us",1
"Class is boring at most times though he is a nice, charismatic guy. Difficult political theory material and I'm not quite sure if it attempts making it easier on anyone.",0
"Confusing set-up. Sometimes it takes over a week, well over, to get grades back... and that is no bueno!! I would suck it up and take Jerry James, at least you will learn something in his course!!",0
"She has a very good sense of humor and very engaging with her students in and out of class. She is a great professor. As long as you come to class and keep up with the material, yo uwill have no problems. :)",1
"Communicates horribly!! Terrible explaining stuff, and requires a lot of work. Not understanding. I did not enjoy her class at all.",0
"Prof. Hess is kind of all over the place. She tends to forget things a lot, and is very unclear about what she expects in essays and in projects. She doesn't have formal instructions for her assignments. She doesn't use Titanium and doesn't post grades. We used the book every day in class. 2 in-class essays, 2 take home essays, 3 exams.",1
"Buckle up, and enjoy the ride!",0
No Comments,0
"He is rude. I asked him to answer symble questions that I was not understanding. So I asked a symple question about an exam that is coming up. I asked ""what can I study for this quiz specifically, so that I do not study the wrong thing"". Simple enough. He said ""I am not answering any other questions"" which I thought was rude.",0
"Awful guy, would rate 0/5 if I could. He is so rude and inconsiderate. Office hours are a joke. He'll dock you a point every punctuation error on the lab reports.",0
"The content of this class is fine but his grading system is simply awful. It's far too easy to pass but far too difficult to get an A. With surprise test questions, sporadically dispersed (yet heavily weighted)  iclicker questions, and no extra credit I was the only one to actually achieve the score for an A (95) in nearly 250 students. Ridiculous.",0
Mr. Prunty is an amazing professor! His teaching style is easy to follow and very straight forward! Loved everything about his class! Definitely want to take math from him again!,1
"This class was amazingly interesting. I loved lecture and section. I found out that history and archaeology can be pretty raunchy. One time I dozed off in class and woke up to, ""...trying to pass it off as the foreskin of Jesus..."" He relates a lot of things to The Godfather and Italians. It's a very fun class and I recommend it to anyone!",1
"This class made no logical sense how would you expect someone to pass a class when you get test/quizzes and , homework on material you haven't even learned yet. His teaching style is so robotic too with little to no emotion what so ever. 0/5 wouldn't meme again.",0
"BEST teacher ever!!!!! If you want to get A, just choose her class. ",1
Most boring professor at the university.  Totally unsympathetic to student concerns.,0
Would not recommend taking his class; boring jokes about his prior jobs and his exams are pretty tricky. Make sure to do your homework cause his quizes are mostly from it(also note that he promises you 10 and at the end you only have 7 or less) and also don't expect him to give you any extra help/credit if you need it. Stay away from his class!!!!,0
"Im going to be honest, his accent his very heavy and he always pronounce stuff differently. The tests are hard and he tells us what's going to be in it but when the test comes it's not what he said. He goes way to fast and he can't help it. WORSE TEACHER HEVER DO NOT TAKE HIM. ",0
"Prof. Evans has great lectures but is not clear at all in his expectations. For example, you'll complete your first assignment with no instructions as to what he expects in your answers and will probably get a low grade. There are only 4 homework assignments, midterm, final exam, and a ""subjective evaluation"" (participation and attendance combined)",1
"Dr. Neupane was absolutely amazing! I took him for a five week physics course. It was extremely challenging; however, he was always available before and after class for additional help. In addition, he was very fair with grading, and he truly wanted his students to do well in the course! I would take him over and over again!",1
"Professor Choi, (NOW BAEK, because of marriage), amazing professor, lectures are so clear, no-book, very, very clear notes, relates the subject to real life situations. Homework is assigned, but you get the solutions, so take very good notes! they're tests and a final exam, kinda forgot whether we had a midterm or not but I don't recall taking one",1
DONT TAKE IT WITH FOWLE..SHE DISCOURAGE YOU FROM BEING AN ENGLISH MAJOR!,0
"You're going to have to rely on your textbook. She rambles  and goes off-topic during lectures, mentioning things she thinks are ""interesting"" but they're really unnecessary to know. We don't have any study guides or review in class for tests. She keeps wanting to make it more challenging for us without teaching us the basics first so we get lost.",0
"Bring your ""PAF"" count; bring your ""Blessure narcissique"" count; bring your pillow",0
Blanton is super boring. He is a nice person but a horrible professor. He will try to make jokes; you will not laugh. Half the class is spent on him trying to figure out the computer. Not the worst class but you must be disciplined; it's easy to fall asleep.,0
"Dr. Chalk is very good at leading discussions. When people don't have anything to say she'll input her own ideas. Participation definitely helps. There is a lot of reading, but it's also a lit course so what do you expect? Very available for help on essays. The books are interesting and she has good insights. She's also funny which helps",1
lectures are for videos. the content you teach yourself with the textbook so may as well take it online. weekly quiz based on textbook questions so absolutely need the textbook. overall was very boring but easy class,0
"If you really want to learn, dont take this class. She teaches the class like if its a middle school math class. She moves on to fast and doesnt make the lessons clear and understandable. So much homework . Horrible math professor",0
"Professor Guttmann is very knowledgeable, he will ask you to understand and explain all the materials to him. The lecture is amazing, you will learn a lot. Take him! The exam is a little bit hard and homework will ask you to write a lot (discussion board), but if you write more than he expects, you will get extra credit (will boost from B to A-).",1
I loved taking this class.Professor Guzzone is  great..Never boring and the tests aren't bad if you do the reading.I recommend it to anyone who loves music.,1
"She is one of the sweetest professors I've ever had at UBC, especially in the ECON department. Do the work and you will be more than fine. This is the third class I've taken with her.",1
Dr Delius is one of the best professors I've had at Fordham. Her assignments are actually fun to do and her lectures are very interesting. Participation matters a lot though and can seriously affect your grade. Highly recommend taking Urbanism with her.,1
"He tends to be sarcastic and sadistic, including when giving students feedback in front of the class. His instructions were sometimes unclear. When asked for clarification, he can be quite mean. His criteria for speeches sometimes seem to reflect his personal interests, and he sometimes gives contradicting parameters.",0
"Took online sociology marriage and families. Avoid this professor for online classes, his syllabus is in broken English, he is not responsive to messages, and he does not have anywhere regarding the assignments throughout the semester, just sends weekly messages of what is due. Maybe a good professor in person, but awwful for online material.",0
"Amazing,best teacher I've had in UWF!",1
She was a great professor! Extremely helpful and a nice person. Tests were easy if you went to class because she summerized everything.,1
"This class drove me NUTS! He teaches so slow, and goes over so manny things that you should've learned years ago that I couldn't hardly stand sitting through class. He also wrote down the problems on the board wrong more than he got them right. We had to show him how to solve the problems most of the time. Mostly we students had to teach eachother.",0
"Professor MacCabe teaches a tough subject so bear that in mind before signing up. He gives more assignments than any other teacher I've ever had, but I will say he is also very FAIR in both grading and allowing late work to be turned in. You take his class you better be ready to not only read the textbook but also get ALL your assignments in.",1
I love Michelle Hunt. She is very good at explaining things. Shares power points online. Knows everyones name in a 50+ person lecture. Organized. Tests are fair. Listen and take notes in lecture and you are set. Never assigned reading from textbook. Sweetest lady you will ever meet. Taking her again next semester for Anatomy II. ,1
Prof. Cutler had done nothing to help her class. half the people dropped out after the first exam and lies about what will be on quizzes. She does an awful job at explain questions that students have. It seems as though she is setting her students up for failure. I would NOT take this ever again with her.,0
"Prof Merdian is not funny or caring. He screams and mocks students in front of the whole class. Some students (yes, plural) dropped his class due to the anxiety he was giving them. He surely knows his stuff, but teaching is not his forte. Very disorganized and we never used the book or lab manual. Be ready to lean a lot on your own...",0
"He has a tendancy to get off the topic sometimes, but more often than not, his lectures were interesting.  Translation quizzes were easy and papers weren't too long.",1
"Wow! Say your prayers and keep praying from from day 'til the very end. The material is hard enough and he makes it even harder. He is very knowledgeable, but his method of teaching only brings confusion to the mind. He encourages students to visit him in his office. Homework, tests and final essay are hard and demanding. Wish you all the best :D",1
"One of the best teachers at Bates, would definately recommend to all....",1
"Have to read about 30 pages per reading, does not answer emails, does not post grades, doesn't update things that she says she would. Honestly one of the worst English teachers I've ever had.",0
if that was psychlogy then i'm glad it wasnt my major...another bad class at PBU...all he did was preach every class and show movies...,0
"Worst class I have taken at MCC. Lots of homework, impossible lectures, no study guide (you are on your own between book info, online homework info, lecture info and info she assumes you know from previous classes. SAVE YOUR GPA AND DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! She is rude to students during class. After having to deal with her I am changing my major.",0
"Brad is a wonderful professor. He truly cares about your future and your experience as a student. He wants you to take away more from his class than just what's in the book; He wants you to become a leader. He will go above and beyond to help you succeed. There is no reason why you shouldn't do well in his classes. Also, he offers a lot of EC.",1
"This Professor is disrespectful, unprofessional, condescending and mediocre. I did not learn anything from this class, she is more interested in hearing her self speak and repeating irrelevant information in the third person rather than if her students understand. You cannot ask questions, you will be attacked. DONT TAKE HER CLASS YOU WILL REGRET!!",0
"Dr. Guerriero is such a sweetheart! Although her class is a little dry at times, she definitely knows what she is talking about, and I learned a lot in her class! I would definitely recommend her if you WANT TO TEACH special ed! If you want to teach gen ed, she may be a little boring to you.",1
By far the worse professor that I have ever had! His classes are extremely boring. Attendance a must! Gives way too much material to read & expects you to have it all memorized. Gives weekly pop quizzes! He raises his voice & talks down to the class. He's unclear on his assignments & grades very tough. Gives last a ton of last minute assignments!,0
she is really all over the place when lecturing. notes are hard to take and hard to understand because she goes so fast. I had to find a lot of outside help in this class. she is pretty good about extra credit and letting you turn things in whenever you want though.,0
"Loves what he does and is happy to answer all of your questions. Has a workbook, which you work each day by answering question and answers, just like in English.",1
I had him for Theory and Aural Skills. He was so helpful! In theory you get homework every night from the workbook but it's pretty simple. Only a 2 or 3 pages a night. The tests are way easier than the homework too. Aural skills was easy too. He moves at a slow pace so everyone can be on the same level. I definitely recommend him!,1
Worst teacher I have ever had. I had to drop. Niu is very quiet which makes it really boring. She has no passion. Doesn't know how to teach.,0
"His lecturing isn't the worst, but he makes you fill in blanks and you have to add textboxes when you could be paying attention to his lecture. He tests on very specific and arbitrary details and the marking scheme is unnecessarily rigid (good luck reading his mind when there's five missing words in a row for fill in the blanks).",0
Fantastic professor. Made accounting easy and gave lots of real world examples for application for accounting basics. We had a lot of schedule changes but he was consistent and understanding. Quizzes and HW are once a week and he gave extra credit for every test. I enjoyed the class greatly.,1
"The worst professor ever in NC state. He doesn't teach, and he's not organized at all. Try to avoid him whatever costs you!!!!",0
Constantly goes off topic to talk about the Carrib community in Dominica. Have to read a lot of articles and 2 VERY boring books. Tests are way too hard and require you to do too much. Often wondered if we'd ever make it through a powerpoint.,1
"Would not take with him he is always off topic, we were 4 chapters behind where we should have been give easy questions for assignments and super hard ones for test. Doesn't explain things well. Would not take again with him",0
"Prof is very passionate about the material. Willing to give hints on how to treat assignment questions if you are stuck. Very positive energy. Get the books though, he can be hard to follow.",1
"Wonderful instructor very enthusiastic about teaching, which is the only thing that kept me, engaged in the subject. However, the exams were time consuming for a one hour and fifteen minute class. Again, great instructor but if you do not have time to cross all your Ts and dot  your I's go with another instructor. Beware group project. ",1
"Not hard but not helpful.  All you do is read slides all class.  Tests are the only thing counted for grade 20Q multiple choice and he curves. Didn't make us ""present"" our final project either just turn it in. All in All just an ok prof",0
"Danny is the best acting teacher. He pushes every single student to give their best. After you reach that mark, he pushes you to be even better. I'm grateful for having had him as a Professor. Great scenes too. My class was full of amazing talents.",1
"Tough class, but he will give you points for anything, so show your work. Great guy and awesome class. If you think the material is boring, it will make it hard to listen and do well.",1
Did not learn anything throughout the whole semester.,0
"So this class is definitely challenging. You need to study a little more than just following along with the HTML tutorials for the tests. If you email her though and ask to see if your website is correct & working, she will respond quickly and tell you what is wrong and how exactly to fix it.",1
"Whatsoever, DO NOT take him as your prof. Biggest procrastinator i have ever seen in my life. Took 8 weeks to grade 2 assignments. No feedback on time and doesn't reply to emails for up to 4-5 days, sometimes never.",0
"Teaches from pictures from book. Not very helpful, hard grader,must read the book to pass.",0
Mean,0
"Fox is no joke. She played welcome to the jungle and what the fox says on the first day of class. It was very fitting. The class is hard but I walked out grammar nazi. I ended up taking her the following semester for Eng102 and it was worth it. If you want to becomes a better writer and ace papers in other classes, she's who you need!",1
"Good lecturer, but his lectures are all about theory and not about how to solve the problems on his tests, which look nothing like the problems in the textbook and he gives no problems sets or quizzes to prepare. Not helpful or interested in helping - refused to explain a basic concept in office hours because it was below him. Avoid at all costs. ",0
Do NOT take this Professor! Ever! Run! Quick change classes and SAVE YOURSELF! Worst Prof. Ever.,0
"Professor Gier is excellent at getting the point across in every lecture. You actually learn stuff in his classes. Also, most assignments are not a drag and they are fun to do, gives great feedback on them. I recommend.",1
"Seems like she is scared to be up in front of the class teaching, sometimes stutters or doesnt know when you ask her a question.  Overall pretty boring and irrelevant class.",0
She is Awful! She told our class that we could not ask questions during class because she had to many slides to go through. She mows through 150 slides on average a day. Rediclous,0
Hard class but not necessarily a bad teacher.. you just need to do your part. The tests are very hard but his curve is awesome. He also gives a quiz almost every class worth 10 points to keep you on your feet. I would say it's not the end of the world if you sign up for him but he's probably the hardest teacher for 120/121.,0
"I took this course online and I would not recommend this class to anyone taking it with her . Her exams do not correspond to her powerpoint lectures online. There would be a minimum of 2-5 questions that relate to anything that she has taught us in her online lectures, thus making her exams tricky. Take her seated course instead.",0
"Dropped, do not recommend. You will not learn anything from this prof. How he became a prof is beyond me.",0
She is the worst teacher ever! Sucks you have to take this crap!,0
"Tons of reading, but Haldane is a fair grader. She's nice and seems to really care about her students.",1
"Barely showed up to class & had no idea what was going on ever & got an A two semesters in a row (ENC1101 & ENC 1102). Easiest class I have ever taken. Grumpy teacher but if you keep your binder organized you basically get an A. Also, he lets class out super quickly. ",0
"Her notes didn't make any sense- my study group couldn't even comprehend them when I asked for help. Her tests are ridiculous and she doesn't teach in any logical order, just throws random information in at different times about different things.",0
"SON COURS EST SUPER PLATE!!! 
 iL NY A PAS DE FIL CONDUCTEUR!",0
"I really wish there was a tag option that says: DOES NOT CARE. I reached out to her several times throughout the semester, received a response 1 in every 5 times. She doesn't care about her students whatsoever and an all around horrible professor. The idea behind her extra papers is fine, but she gives you nothing to go on. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS",0
"doesnt take attendance which is awesome....basically your grade only depends on the 5 tests over the semester, you pass those your fine..homework is easy,he goes over it in class and you can get your answers there and i loved that he gave you credit on tests for trying even if you got the wrong answer, but he was really softspoken hard to hear",0
No Comments,0
"There is a lot of reading in this class that is very, very dense so do not take during a heavy semester because you will spend a lot of time reading. Lecture and section are mandatory. Professor Roberts does not give a very organized lecture, but the material is really interesting. I am still confused about what they wanted for the papers...",0
Terrible attitude toward students. Unprofessional. Severely unorganized. I would avoid this professor completely.,0
"The only bad thing is he didnt follow the syllabus really, so I was confused most of the time about what homework was due and when. However, he really is a great teacher, he likes to joke around with students and ensure that everyone knows the content. Pay attention/participate in class, dont have your phone out and youll be fine.",1
Save yourself she will mess up your average.,0
I had Prof. Dattolo and not only did I learn so much in his class he showed his students that he really cares about our learning. He was always there for extra help and he would always be so clear in his lectures. I really looked forward to going to his class . He has made a lasting impression on me. All professors should be like Prof. Dattoolo.,1
"I loved this class. The professor makes his lectures truly interesting and engaging. He's easily the best professor I've had at this school, I definitely recommend his class!",1
"hard teacher, looooong powerpoint lectures guys a genius so i guess it just comes to him while the students blankly stare at his examples as he zooms through them. one midterm and a final. tough class make sure youre a math wiz and quick learner",0
"One of the least helpful and least responsive professors I've ever had. She never responded to my emails by answering the questions I had she always just redirected me to the tutoring center, even for technical issues that the tutoring center couldn't really help with. I wouldn't recommend this teacher to anyone.",0
"He is a super easy professor, but he will put you to sleep so fast. He gives a good amount of writing assignments, but they are all really simple. Lots of grades so it is easy to make an A. Requires attendance. He let me redo a paper that I did bad on and then he gave me full credit. Nice guy, just boring.",0
"The class was online, you had to respond to a discussion once a week, and had 3 days to complete a 8 page papers. Take her if you don't mind all of your weekends disappearing.",0
"I took her class 2 semesters ago, and I absolutely LOVED her class. She is so nice and HELPFUL.She is a hard grader, but she offers extra credit and you can correct your papers and she gives you the new grade.One thing that I love about her is that she still knows my name even 2 semesters later. DO your part and she will help you as much as she can",1
"One of the hardest classes I've ever taken, by one of the best professors I've ever had. frustrated with the workload for just one credit, but ended up being worth it for the valuable information. Tough grader, not flexible with lateness. But she did care very much about her students success. Don't take if you aren't prepared to work hard.",1
Class spikes sharply in difficulty  half way through. I tried to explain that I was struggling in the class because I was pouring all of my effort into calculus (another class required for business) and he really couldn't seem to care less,1
"michael is such a cute old man! despite the fact that his tests were hard as**** and did not focus on anything in class, he was still so enthusiastic about the subject matter. great guy, ridiculous class.",1
"He barely knows what he's talking about it seems like, students are constantly correcting him. This confuses the students and makes it hard to understand. He seems to not care about failing students and probably thinks he's doing his part in helping explain the material which he isn't. Don't take him, you might as well teach it to yourself.",0
This professor is TERRIBLE.  It's one of those classes where you have to teach yourself.  The class is unorganized & lectures are extremely boring.  Oh and don't plan on getting an A+ in this class....I had a 98% and he only gave me an A.  I emailed him about it and he said that he only gives out A+'s to students who get 100% or more in his class.,0
Very intelligent Professor who teaches in a style that many do not like.  He lays out what is required to do well in the class and many refuse to listen.,1
He is the best.,1
Shes cool. She makes things easy to understand.,1
"Avoid this professor. Bad in every way. Rude, arrogant, hard to reach, and disorganized.",0
Amazing teacher and all around great person! He really wants his students to learn about computers and makes every efforts to make sure you get an A. Very fair and funny! Gives cool sites everyday....be careful they can be addictive! :) Take him!!! You won't regret it :),1
Class was hard and teacher went off on random talks about her views. I wish I could say something good about the teacher but it was the worst experience in my college career.  If you want less stress and more time in your life than please dont take this teacher.,0
"Super Easy to pass. The powerpoints are online and she pulls all her exam questions from them. Going to class isn't necessary although she does take attendance and will switch out your lowest test score with your attendance so going to class is beneficial. She's pretty laid back and very friendly, I would take a class by her again.",1
No Comments,1
"If you must take this course, here's some advice: DO NOT listen to what the TA and prof say about failing the midterm-I swear they WANT students to freak out. All that is difficult is the format. If you complete the hw and understand it, the exams are simply re-worded hw probs. Do practice problems and don't depend on excel formulas to do them.",0
"I did not like his teaching style. He reads directly from slides, which he posts after class. His quizzes and tests are all multiple choice, and he offers extra credit. However, many of his questions are poorly worded and some confusing.",0
"Had Greg for Estimating I. His exams are difficult, but he teaches excatly the skills needed in the field. Wish more professors in the CM department taught as well as he does!",1
I am not much of a reader or someone who likes English classes but I really enjoyed her class! She made the material relevant and interesting and everything she had us read was interesting and made me want to be engaged.,1
"The yoga sessions are great, but she pretty much just reads straight from the readings during lecture.",1
"Dr. Mike has clear lectures and is very humorous. He is always ready to help in the Physics Help Room. He can get frustrated if you don't understand the material right away, but overall he is a good teacher. EXAMS ARE HARD.",1
"I took Danny Dyer for Math 1000 online during the summer session before my first semester so it was a condensed version of the course but you still learn everything. He gave an assignment after every week of material, so you knew if you understood the content early on. Funny guy and made sure to answer all questions during our live sessions.",1
"This class seemed interesting but it was kinda boring. Teacher is great though, his stories are funny and we watched interesting videos in class. But the tests are extremely hard.",1
Professor May knows his stuff. I really benefited from his knowledge. I would recommended his class.,1
This class was way too difficult. I have taken many psych courses here and this is one of the hardest. I'm a straight A student and I will be lucky to pass this class with a c+,0
"She lies : Says she'll drop the lowest test score & then throws you a curve ball w/ ""The final score is what replaces your worst score""  ""This you DON'T need to know""- shows up on the test She's constantly talking @ seminars instead of teaching Her teaching isn't helpful at all, get ready to teach yourself! (I recommend Khan Academy) She's Hurtful!",0
"Hard to take notes from his jumbled mess on the board. He doesn't answer questions thoroughly. The Mrs. even complained about the way he tried helping her with the PE exam. His final exam was impossible. Be sure to just make a really good reference sheet for tests, and try to do the homework.",0
"Not a good prof.  Materials she teaches in class have nothing to do with Management Info Systems.  You will learn nothing in her class.  She will give you directions on how she wants assignments done, then she will still punish you anyway regardless.  Very unnecessarily cruel and evil prof.  Shame.",0
Ask any female student!  He is hot!,1
Best history prof. at the U. He seems easy at first but he will challenge to do better. Wish I could pull off the way he mixes his patterns on his clothes!!!!,1
"Katey Leverson is such a sweetheart and her lectures are always interesting. Her exams are all completely reflective of her lectures, so don't skip class! If you show up, listen, take good notes, and spend the necessary time on your homework, you will do great in this class.",1
Great professor and very interesting class!,1
"Your grade is based on one exam, weekly quizzes, recitations, and homework. The professor flies through lecture slides, but lecture recordings are posted. She makes a lot of mistakes in class and can be rude to students. We had to fight for extra credit that was in the syllabus. If you have the option, you might want to choose someone else.",0
Avoid.,0
"Discrete Structures is a boring course made even more dry by Ratana Ngo's somewhat robotic teaching style. He really tries to make sure the class understands, but his presentation leaves many falling asleep.",0
Favorite college professor thus far! She is very helpful and entertaining.,1
"Hes not a good lecturer at all. Nothing he says makes sense and when it does he makes it needlessly confusing. I didnt even bother attending lectures after the first two months and I still got an A, showing how useless it actually is. Do the readings and youll be fine. Hes just so BORING and pompous",0
"Professor Yemut is really cool, nice about the class. Can be hard to understand due to his accent but overall I understood everything and took a lot out of the class. Can be funny sometimes with the examples and is really easily approachable.",1
Hardest class and hardest grader ever in IU. Do not take her unless you are willing to go through a rough semester !,0
Professor Doubleday is an amazing professor and is perfect for teaching russian. Her conversation class is well organized and great for facilitating speaking skills. It was a fun class that definitely benefited my learning of a language.,1
"I cannot recommend Lisa enough! Not only does she know the material she is teaching incredibly well, she genuinely cares about her students-which you don't see often with college professors. If I could take this class again I would do it in a heartbeat. She cares about giving us the materials to be the best advocates/teachers, take her class!",1
"The worst professor I have ever had. He does not care about the online class at all, does not answer emails or messages. Do whatever you have to do to avoid taking him.",0
Tons of papers to write and lots of reading too. Extremely boring class not fun at all. Doesn't take recommendations from students. Held a B grade in the class all semester and he ended up failing me because I missed more than 5 days,0
Excellent instructor.... very knowledgeable.. loves to teach ...some test take home... but they are tough... I didn't mind that.. because.. she is an all around motivator and has inspired me to continue with the teaching field!!,1
"Prof Platz is young and she relates to her students in a way where she realizes that you do not want to have a lot of work. She is really understanding and helpful if you talk to her one on one. The course material and homework is easy, just annoying. She also is not the easiest grader in the world but if you put in effort then you will get an A",1
She is by far the worst teacher I have ever had!  She goes through the material very fast; the problems we do in class to practice are nothing like the problems on the test.  I think she intentionally tries to confuse everyone.  Do not take her if you don't have to!,1
"Dr. Crawley LOVES his job and it shows in the classroom. I have had him several times and would take him again. He is funny, relatable, light hearted and very knowledgeable. He is easily accessible outside of class and will help you with anything. He is one of the heads of the psych department and therefore offers a lot of help and advice.",1
".Not a lot of feedback, she doesn't like to get emails by students. It is really hard to get good grade own this class. However, I have learned a lot of things fro her! She is organized and clear how to teach. DEFINITELY, HARD GRADER!! DONT TAKE HER CLASS IF YOU WANT TO PASS EASILY!",0
 he didn't clarify much and he's a very hard grader I wouldn't take him ever again,0
Mr Leonard is pretty cool. He is very reasonable on his grading scale. The work load in his class is definitely manageable. You have to go to the labs or you probably won't pass the class. He gives you a study guide and the answers so there is no reason to score less than a B on them! Good teacher!,1
Lots of extra credit but tough class and not so good of a professor,0
he is lazy....he should be paying us to take the course.  i didn't learn a thing in this course and if you don't play like a pro then you do aweful and he doesn't respect you.,0
goes well beyond material in the assigned readings; often brilliant and original insight; dynamic teaching style; helps students develop interest in the topic; does not waste class time; more exegesis than one might expect from a systematic theology course,1
"Didnt learn much from this guy, and the only reason I passed was because the answers on his multiple choice practice exams were actually the same on his actual test.  So theres that.",0
Mrs. DePinto is a true gem. She is truly a great teacher I have learned a lot from her this semester. I am so glad to have taken her class. She expects hard work from her students.,1
"Miranda.. I like your sense of style but, your lectures lack information. I do like to hear that protists are beautiful and fungi is cool but, you will never test me on that stuff so why are you telling me it? Miranda, your lectures need to switch gears from strong personal feelings about things to the stuff you plan to test us on..  ",0
Don't take this professor. He is unclear on assignments and is one of the toughest graders I've ever met.,0
"I had a mixed experience with Prof Rubin. The labs are clear cut and easy to do, but the final exam was a mess. There's no real study prep and questions were given that we did NOT cover. She is very dated and gives advice no longer relevant. Avoid this prof, and if you get stuck w/her, be sure to do an HONEST AND DETAILED evaluation.",0
"Just finished up A&P1 spring 2018 with Prof Zeman. She really is a wonderful teacher, the best I have had at RCC so far. She is so funny, and tells it how it is. She can totally relate to students as she was a student herself not that long ago so she gets it. Only wish she were teaching A&P 2. Definitely take her, you wont find anyone better!",1
Avoid at your own cost.,0
"If I had an accurate portrayal of what his class was really like, I never would've taken it in a million years. Don't expect to actually learn that much about epidemiology. This class had the potential to be awesome but fell totally flat because of the prof. Got an A but would never put myself through that again. His personality gave me gray hairs.",0
"I've gone to several office hours to ask more specific questions, and I found him to be rude and condescending. He will help you, but be prepared to feel like an idiot for asking. The first test was similar to the homework problems, but the final was unnecessarily difficult. Find another teacher, if you can. He was awful.",0
"Dr. Lafferty was extremely organized and gave clear directions.  Class consisted of several module posts, 1 powerpoint, and a final exam.  She was a little strict on APA but was super easy to get in contact with and always willing to help.  I would highly recommend her!!",1
"Dr. Bonaccorsci is very clear in her expectations, and is a good lecturer. Her lectures were very reflective of what was going to be on the homework/tests.",1
She's too subjective. The course goes in circles and it's so theoretical it hurts. No substance. Unnecessarily tough grader. Take Brenner.,0
He's a nice and caring person but his lectures were absolutely useless for even his own exams. They did not cover enough content for the textbook aplia mindtap quizzes either. The midterms and final exams(mcqs) had a lot of questions that were not covered in his lectures. Take another prof if you can Be ready to study from the textbook yourself.,0
"Probably the best teacher I could've had coming back to school she really made me want to be a better version of me. Her class can be easy if you take notes and participate, her lectures are always great and she is really sassy and funny .she cares a lot about her students. the sweetest and most hard working women youll ever meet.",1
Do not take this professor unless you are a fulltime student and enjoy spending over 20 hours EACH WEEK doing homework. Expect work to be assigned every single day. That is not an over exaggeration. She has a firm belief in quantity over quality. I learned very little and her interactions with students are cringe-worthy and combative.,0
"Overall, he should not be teaching.  If you like a professor who thinks they know everything and thinks they are higher than you, this is who you should take.",0
No Comments,0
"Mr. Daigle advised female students in our class to invite other (complete stranger) students home with them for study group. A lot of his other advice was also archaic, not to mention dangerous. He is stuck in another time. He also gives very few tests on lots of material, so if you have a bad memory, this is a class to skip. ",0
Amazing!,1
"Dr. K is a cool outside of class, but not a great professor. Tests are difficult (multiple choice A-O, extended response worth 30 pts, etc). There was a multiple choice question that 100% of the class got wrong, but wasn't thrown out because we ""should have known it"". When asked for tips for the test, he said ""go to bed early"". Lab is also a mess.",0
"I highly suggest to not take Dr. Bush pre-calc online course! Unless you are okay to teach yourself about this course with ""0"" lecture. The only way I could learn something was by doing the homework. Nothing more than that was ever offered. Theres 2 exams and no extra credit! Actually there was 5 points*. Thanks Wendy! But srly, do not take her!!!",0
"5 questions quizzes every class bout assigned reading, sounds easy right? Wrong. Questions always consist of the most trivial parts of reading! Tests are multiple choice, but don't let that fool you! They are still extremely difficult! The course material is challenging to say the least and his ;lectures do not clarify anything! Also talks too fast",0
"His class is not that easy. Basically he doesn't teaches the course he just tells you go and read it if you don't understand then i will explain. All around the place goes from chapter 5 to chapter 2. Exams are T/F, multiple choices, and 3-4 problems to solve.",0
"I learned a lot in this class and really enjoyed it.  I would recommend this class as long as you don't mind watching very powerful films that affect you deeply.  Some of the films were very hard to watch.  Other than that, it was a great class",1
"while i was in his class he goes off topic, grades his students off english 121 and expect his students to know how to write a paper and does not guide his students on any assignments. Speaks very low he tries to be funny but personally i did not learn anything from this class i am retaking english 28.",0
"Incredible class.  Fred is an incredible guy.  A teacher that really cares about reaching students, at least students who care.  My favorite class in my Mercy undergrad.  Don't let his time be wasted on you!  Soak in what he has to teach you because it speaks of a level of education that most don't know about.  Life lived.",1
This teacher is unprofessional and rude when you ask for help. Makes fun of students and talks down to his students. Should NOT be a teacher.,0
"He is a nice guy and the class is a typical English class. However, he took forever to grade and I wish he gave harsher feedback. During conferences, he would dance around what he wanted to say and after he graded it, I realized what he really meant.",1
"He starts off as a great prof because of his sense of humor, but his lectures mostly consist of him reading off his power point slides, which is also posted online. He also posts the test questions as a ""review"" and they can be found on quizlet. Honestly, an easy A. He's a super nice and cool dude with an accent.",1
HOnestly I have taken manuy online classes and have a GOA of 3.74 before before I took this professors class. She is hard to please if you get a bad grade and you question her she will give you details but when you apply her notes to the next assignments she will just add more issues. This professor is seriously the worst professor ever. STAY AWAY!,0
"If you are not a political sci major, don't take this class. It's a ton of work and its not actually that interesting (its mostly just theory). She is also a strict grader and her system always seemed a little vague to me. She also cares a lot about things like passive voice in your journal entries, so if you are not a grammar nazi, watch out!",1
Best teacher ever easy A very funny and also makes sure you understand everything,1
"If grammar or spelling are a challenge for you, beware she will go after you 1-on-1 & in class. You HAVE to read!! You will not survive the blackboard post or class discussions without it. My class read 4 novel sized memoirs. You are graded super subjectively on ""if you are getting it"" & you are graded on two essays and BB posts. No tests/quizzes.",0
"Nice guy, replies to emails, and is pretty lenient with assignments. He practically gives you the answers for the midterm and final, and if you do the assignments it's an easy A. However the lectures are incredibly boring. He reads his PowerPoint slides word for word and it's obvious he doesn't know how to teach, result: didn't actually learn much.",0
Class is boring and professor is not teaching the useful content. not recommend if you want to major in business. he's nice though,0
"This course earned my first C in my 3 year college career.  Teacher would make us do hw and take tests before ever teaching the subject, which she thought was a hot new teaching method, so the only reason to take the class was for the weekly quizzes, because after that you would not learn anything new. Reading the book was the only way to learn.",0
He's a great teacher. His tests are more than manageable if you pay attention during his review sessions. Homework on each chapter and attendance boost your grade.,1
Decent lady but she can come off as rude at times. Get ready to sit in the most redundant class. As she drags out discussion and you will listen to people practically say the same thing over and over. I did an assignment early by following the syllabus and she added requirements not specified. Then got an attitude when I brought it up.,0
"Very poor experience in her online class. She took a week to respond to emails, posted an exam ten hours later than promised, and tested us on very obscure details from our course notes. The final assignment (worth 25% of our final grade) was based on calculations about mining that we had never been taught in the course. Would not recommend.",0
I have been taught by Ruchika ma'am in my Bachelor's and believe me she is the best teacher anyone would want.,1
"I was never good at Spanish but she made it manageable. She explained the material clearly. Sometimes she was funny which made class more enjoyable. She would also give us lots of hints on what would be on the test which was nice because her moto is ""Life is hard enough, so I don't want to make it any harder""",1
"He used a graduate level text for an undergrad course.  Highlight of the course: ""This is a very important theorem that we will use a lot"" followed by, ""I am not sure it's true"" when after about 10 minutes he couldn't prove it.  I think he used that course as a vehicle to get paid to review group theory for himself.",0
"Dr Avila is the best professor that I have ever had. Her class isn't hard if you pay attention to her lectures, study prior to the tests and do the work. She does offer some extra credit which helps a lot. Its important to attend her class because you could miss important info. There are quizzes everyday but they aren't hard and help prepare you.",1
Dont be fooled by the fake charm. Mean in her core.,0
"Dr. Ryan is very knowledgeable and a good resource for all students in the health sciences. He is a fast talker, so you may need to record his lectures, and you absolutely have to study for his tests. They cover a lot of information. He does give some ""freebies"" on his tests and quizzes. He is a lot of fun and tries to make lectures interesting.",1
He is quite the angry teacher whenever someone has a question he gets annoyed straight away. Ask more than one and he''ll barely even help. He makes it overly obvious that he has no interest in helping. As far as teaching goes well he DOESN''T teach just reads straight off a powerpoint. You WILL have to teach yourself stay away when possible.,0
SHE IS EASY BUT STUDY HER NOTES AND HER REVIEW. STUDY HER NOTES NOT ONLY HER REVIEW. SHE IS NICE AND CLEAR. GOOD LUCK!,1
"Kristi isn't clear with what she wants for the projects. Expects us to do a lot of things, but can't even catch up herself? It's past Christmas and still isn't done grading all of the assignments. Very little engagement with the class. Disappointing.",0
"awful professor. if you are not white, heterosexual, and Christian please don't take this class. she will completely ignore the book and give you information based on her personal views. I've almost had to get up and walk out of class based on her remarks. class time is spent expressing hate and no actual learning. please do not take this class.",0
He is an accounting stud!  Follow his ways and you will be successful.  ,1
"She'll give weekly quizzes, and if she sees that majority of the class did poorly on a certain problem, she will stick it on the next quiz without warning.",0
Do the work and you'll be fine. Seek help and he will help you. Don't expect him to pick you out of all the students. This was my third attempt at Statistics and he made it easier to comprehend.,1
"You have to work very hard to just pass this class. It's hard to understand her and she is very particular about your work. Doesn't help you out very much, but she will push you to do your best.",0
"Definetly a great professor, cares a lot about his students and is passionate about teaching. Exams are not the easiest but drops your lowest one, also has lots of buffer grades built into the class. Attendence isn't mandatory but you won't get far if you don't show up and pay attention.",1
LOVE THIS TEACHER!  He the BEST!,1
"Nelly is the sweetest professor, she is very funny and loves to tell stories and always lets class out early. Tests and quizzes are simple, for compositions she grades really easily. Participation is important, it can actually have an affect on your overall grade but she makes it easy by asking questions to class frequently. ",1
Dr. Knox is AMAZING! So fun to listen to and has great stories. The tests are difficult but can be taken online and he gives you two weeks to complete them. The attendance is mandatory which is what hurt my grade. The TA takes attendance even though its a class of 250... so stupid. I am taking Dr. Knox again next semester for Human Sexuality.,1
"Lacks a presence on husky ct like other professors, but compensates with his clarity and devotion to the students. He likes to have fun and is a great lecturer. No homework, not necessary to get the textbook, but can help clear up any confusion.",1
"I had Garyen half in person and half online for my semester. In person, he's really informative and teaches the material very well. His online class is a bit frustrating because his quizzes are really hard, but his exams were manageable. If you have the chance take him in person, otherwise take a different prof for online because he'll be difficult",1
pam does a nice job with examples of what she is teaching.  she gets you excited about what you are doing and realizes we have lives outside of school.  she is tough on grading but it is worth the work.  i recommend her if you really want to enjoy your class,1
"He's really good at teaching and I'm not saying that he's better than other professors per se but his teaching styles meet my way of understanding. Since, he teaches really fast, you either listen and take pic of notes or take notes and don't listen. Also, you get a second chance to turn in all your unfinished assignments at the end of semester.",1
"I love Dr. Scoville. He's not the most organized professor I've ever had, but he's very flexible and helpful when there's confusion. He really cares about all of his students, and is very passionate about what he teaches. Definitely one of my favorite Arabic professors.",1
"Currently in her ASL 1 class. NICE teacher and EASY class Signs kinda fast but ASK HER QUESTIONS AND TO SLOW DOWN Like any other language, practice is essential Class consist of:2 video assignments, in class sign tests, practice activities, & required deaf event paper I plan to take asl 2 with her in the future.",1
"In this class all, we have to do too many papers. The outlines are not well explained enough and I hate the fact that he believes his course is adequate. As a whole, it is amazing to have an Indigenous member as a prof, but I think the course needs to be updated just a bit!",0
"Terrible teacher, mean, angry, does not care about his students; I don't know why he ever became a teacher. Have to study a lot and use the textbook.  DONT take him you will regret it",0
"Doesn't keep promises on when he will grade stuff. His notes are over 30+ pages because he gives a lot of extra flip flap about personal stuff you don't need to know. When you ask for cut and dry clarity, he still gives you a lot of flip flap. It's supposed to be an online class, yet you have to take the tests in person. The final is cumulative!!!!",0
Literally the worse teacher I have taken within my two years of being at NCC.,0
"I will never take a class by this professor again, nor anyone associated with him. He entered grades once two weeks in and hasn't since, you have to guess your current grade. If you're sick and in the hospital doesn't matter, you have to turn in his weekly essay (approx 5 pages minimum) does the absolute bare minimum, he shouldn't be a teacher.",0
"He IS helpful and nice, although he doesn't look like!",1
"He is an okay professor. He is very quiet. Good thing is he gives homework but not as a grade but instead as bonus and its based off effort. The class was hard to me , but then again I hate math. Lastly if you do all the homework you can raise you're grade by 2 letter grades. I should of had a D., but because I did all the homework I got a B.",0
"I took her for ENC1101 and then recently again for ENC1102. She's honestly one of the best professors at Broward College. She's awesome, caring and funny! She's clear on what she expects and she makes the class fun and interesting. I would recommend her to anyone!",1
"Do not take this professor unless you are a math whiz, like really fast-paced classes, or already have extensive knowledge in the class you plan to take. I took her for Trigonometry, and i was failing most of the semester. She does not take the time to explain her methods and is extremely rude to her students in class. Be ready to study hard.",0
He is the best english professor that I have ever had!  He made class interesting and I never wanted to miss.  I am usually terrible at english so i was worried about this class but it was so easy!  I got an A and i have never received an A in english before!  TAKE HIM!!!,1
"Old fashion teaching- assignments,assignments,assignments. Hard grader.",0
"Professor Allen is amazing! His class is actually pretty interesting, especially since he is quite clearly very enthusiastic about his work. The class is very easy, as the assignments don't require too much work. If you go to lecture and have a decent memory, you will get an A in the class. He also has an English accent!",1
I took prof Rice for lecture and I say just try and avoid her at all costs if you can. She is sarcastic and does not care about you passing at all. Again AVOID AT ALL COSTS IF YOU CAN.,0
"To be fair, Madame Petcoff was pulled in as a replacement for a prof who took ill. That said, she was extremely disorganized. She often promised to put notes on Moodle and only remembered once, wasn't available for office hours, didn't respond to emails, and changed the contents of exams the day of the exam or two days before. It was rough.",0
"His tests were really hard. The tests were nothing like the labs or homework. His lectures weren't so great, he started off expecting you to understand Matlab and how to code. Major of the class failed or got a D. Not an easy class at all.",0
"BSU is extremely lucky to have her.  She is a gem.  My favorite BSU instructor thus far! Thank you, Lisa!",1
Honestly the worst teacher I have ever had. She drags on everything we do. I would never recommend taking her. Incoming freshman beware she is heartless.,0
LOVED this class!! AWESOME!!!,1
"Worst professor in modern history. Teaching is just not for her. She made up an imaginary periodic table for exams, she doesnt care at all. Im begging every student do not take her classes if you want to learn and pass. She is just awful. I wished I read the comments before taking her class. Absolutely do not waste your time and money with her.",0
Omg!I have lots of things to say here!He is the worst class ever in my life!It was horrible!He is very unfair and he expects his students to be professional!He is not helpful and his explanation is difficult to understand!He should know how easy other lab class was at least!It is very unfair!I really hated this class!he is hard grader. Very bad!,0
"Pretty easy class overall but the content can be confusing at times. He lectures well but goes really really fast which was frustrating but he posts all the lectures so that helps out. His exams are short answer but the study guides are pretty straight forward. Nice guy, willing to help you if you need it. I would take another one of his classes. ",1
She's a very good teacher. recommend for anyone who has trouble with reading and writing because she helps in those aspects.,1
dr. oganian is a very good professor. her lectures are clear and she is very helpful,1
Lectures are very confusing and work can be hard to follow. I'd recommend taking Differential Equations with someone else.,0
"Great professor! Lots of energy and clear understanding of the material. She keeps the class very fun. If I had to take another Kine, it would be with her.",1
"It took a few sessions to get get a grasp on his teaching methods.  In the beginning I found him tough to hearunderstand. He lightens up as class progresses. Readpresent alot of cases (says 1, but you end up doing all).  Grade is based on participation & exam; fair grader.  His book is used and it's well written & worth reading to prep for class.",1
Textbook is good study/practice aid but not mandatory. Grade consists of 4 unit exams only. Beware!!! Needed class for major but difficult. one mistake can ruin your chances.,1
"He has a very superficial understanding of sociological theories and does more preaching than teaching. He teaches with a heavy bias, outdated facts, and outdated materials. However, he is very nice, forgiving, and encourages in class/ outside of class discussions. The midterm/final are given and the class comes with five short papers. Easy A.",0
"I really enjoyed James's web development class. The course was a good balance of real world projects, experimental work, and fun challenges. I really appreciated his patience and clear explanations.",1
dread going 2 that class. doesn't talk about anything that is on the tests just talks about 1 topic for more than 3 weeks at a time but than expects you 2 know all that is on the quiz/tests. extremely boring and has too many readings. each assignment is doing a reading from each book which makes things a little confusing. DONT GET HER FOR A TEACHER,0
"Does not teach. Goes on tangets related to his political agenda. He does not walk through problems, better off reading the text yourself and not attending class.",0
This was one of the best classes i have ever taken bc of Jill. She made learning fun and was always willing to clarify the difficult material.  I have never met a teacher so excited about helping students learn. Excellent!,1
"He is a very monotoned speaking guy. He  talks constantly about the same thing without telling you what it means, or if its important. He will tell you you are wrong very rudely if you attempt to raise your hand to answer, yet gets mad at the class for not raising their hand and answering. He is very biased on the way he teaches. Don't take him!",0
horrible and very rude ! don't take any class with him,0
class makes me want to change me major.,0
"The discussion was often slow and sometimes her feedback is unclear and based more on grammar rather than content. She is brilliant when it comes to art and her love for the information is contagious. Glad I had a strong honors writing foundation from first semester going into her class, though.",1
"Professor Adams gives very delayed feedback and is not good with responding to inquiries. There are unclear expectations for assignments, yet she grades harshly. Very critical. ",0
If you have this Professor RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!! She is by far the WORST professor I had @ Temple!!! Buy the book cause its more useful than her Notes. This lady is so careless it's not even funny. The only useful thing in this class is the homework which is extra credit towards exams. DO THE HOMEWORK!!!!,0
"Very nice guy, but not a good professor. Hard to understand, little information in his lecture slides, and his tests required so much detail over a lot of information, which  made it difficult to succeed. Try to get a different professor if you can.",0
"would rather take 3 classes of biology and do a ton of research papers than to take this teacher again, can't explain the material well enough and doesn't give tests that are relevant to the classes point of material covered, students beware...",0
"Great guy, willing to talk and work things out with you. Homework is online and very easy, search all problems in google. Class is easy to follow along but he has a thick accent. Didn't use book ever. Class examples are test problems. Overall physics is a hard subject.",1
Dr. Hargett is great! Expect 2 tests and a research paper that she gives you plenty of time to do. Interesting course and the reading is very life applicable. Quite a bit of discussions each week but it is engaging and relies on your perspective more than text. Great class!,1
"I had Prof Berry during the semester that we switched online due to COVID-19. Although it was a huge change for all of us, she really went above & beyond in her efforts to show up for us. Excel is not an easy class, but she made videos and held Zooms for all the tough concepts, responded quickly to emails, was a fair grader, etc. I 10/10 recommend.",1
Someone with such a lack of respect for American students should go home to whence they came.,0
"Marie Larsen is a top-notch teacher and a lovely person.  She knows what's required to excel, and is all about helping those who commit to the class.  She matched my investment in the class in every way, even offering up a small conference room near her office as a de facto homework room where she was practically always available.   A+",1
"Amazing Professor. Cares about his students, grades fairly, and makes the class enjoyable.",1
"Dr. Ghosh is an okay professor. She puts EVERYTHING expected on the first day which is nice but she posts too much information. It's quite overwhelming. It'd be better if she made it to the point right away. Also, she says she will get to you through email.... which is not true. She responds late and doesn't fully answer your question.",1
No rubrics or clear instructions for essays.,0
"Eh. He's okay. He's not the best professor in the entire world. He's quirky and makes you think, but he won't tell you ANYTHING about a big project. He grades harsh and doesn't really tell you what he's even grading on. You can easily make a B. Always go talk to him in his office. He gives great feedback after your grade is out there.",1
"Even if you do exactly what he wants, word by word, you will not get an A. He refuses to give out 100% and can never be reached in time. His lectures have NOTHING to do with anything you do in class, but since attendance is mandatory, it is a waste of time. There are projects back to back with no clear grading criteria and hundreds of assignments.",0
"Makes every concept relatable. He is very open about his life and you will end up knowing him very well. Super sarcastic and easy going. Get the book, go to class, have fun, and you will have a good grade. Definitely take him if you can :)",1
"Bring caffeine to class or you'll fall asleep pretty quick.  Dr. Self is ok, he'd probably be a cool guy out of this boring class.  You might spend every class wondering what is going on but it's do-able.",0
SUPER boring lectures. Probably the worst lectures I've ever attended.,0
"This class was very interesting and provided useful information. Professor Galindo is a great instructor. Grade is based on class activity points, four quizzes, midterm, final, two observations, and an adolescent interview. Everything was on Blackboard, except the final. Easy A. Make sure to read the book, attend class, and do those assignments!",1
"If you want to learn child and adolescent psychology, do not take this class. It is a very easy A but you do not learn a thing.",0
Throughout the course he provided many extra credit opportunities and the workload was not heavy. Their were 2 quizzes each week based off of the lecture and two essays topic of choice relating to class which was very easy. The exams were fair as well. Overall a wonderful teacher. Definitely recommend taking his class.,1
easy A just watch the lecture videos,0
He is a nice professor who cares for his students. I would take more classes with him if i have the chance to.,1
"Take anyone else for writing composition. I didn't enjoy this professor's lack of respect towards her students. Tough grader, have to go to class or you'll fail, pushes agenda on students, just don't take her.",0
"Professor Birch is a lovely professor. She is always on time and prepared for lectures, very knowledgeable about international business, and she is always willing to clarify issues and take opinions from the class. The class was rather easy, only three exams but the third one is optional, no homework, and assignments are few but very fun. Awesome!",1
"Lopez a cool techaer, however he reads off slides which he posts on Rcampus for printing. No homework, One group project for extra credits - very important(involves presentation), Only 3 exams and the last one is the final, he gives out study guides for every test which is very helpful",1
He is a smart guy but not cut out for teaching. Just reads off the slides unless he's talking about his own research. Covers way too much material. Would avoid taking the class or wait till a different professor is teaching it.,0
"Dr. Buchanan is a wonderful professor! He assigned a very easy to read textbook (it was actually interesting!) He really cares about the students. He offers extra credit once in awhile. While attendance isn't mandatory, he randomly picks a day to assign an short task in class once a week, so you gotta go for that!",1
"Dr. Arevalo is such a kind soul. Her lectures were intensive, but they were very helpful and I learned a lot. Her exams were tough, but she helped her students to prepare. She was always very helpful during office hours and really cares about her students. <3",1
"Even though she demands a lot in class, I'd take her again. She really pushes you to the next level! Cont. Modes of Criticism is a hard and rly course. Weekly: 3 hard essays and reflections. Annotated biblio & such for final paper (12-15 pgs)ASK FOR HELP! She will e-mail you back and makes time if you ask.",1
"Professor Connor was great. She gave extensions on things for some students which she passed to the whole class. 2 proctored grades- a test and the final, and note cards were permitted for both. Everything else was online with two attempts for each test. Homework is unlimited and I loved the textbook. Very interactive. I wish she did MGF 1107!",1
Amazing teacher. Made learning fun and very helpful,1
If you work hard and attend class you can get an A. He is very helpful and he wants you to succeed. I recommend that you take this class!,1
"I had Professor Richmond for psychology my fall 2020 online semester. Her class is super straight forward, and it is an easy a for sure!! Her assignments consist of discussion posts, quizzes, and learning activities. There are no exams, not even a final. She is very good with communication as well. I recommend her 100%!",1
"Doesn't have patience God would give a cat. Had to teach myself, very incorherent on what is going to be on the test.",0
He is a tough grader but is clear of what is expected. He tends to go off topic a lot and talks really fast so it makes it hard to understand. If you are not able to reach him during his office hours then he will find time to meet and discuss assignments.,1
"Dr. Ayers is awesome. Dry sense of humor and knows his stuff. No textbook but he does assign a case to read every week, honestly they were interesting reads- not boring at all. Midterm & final all short answer questions. if you go to classtake notes on main ideasEasy A. I really like his class structure- 90% discussion. Def. will take him again!!",1
"Professor Aguilar is terrible. She gives so much homework, her lectures are ramblings, she does not ever speak about the assignments. She is a rough grader but if you feel you deserve a higher grade she does listen and if you make a good argument she will bump it up. Be ready to read and to do A LOT of writing. She does not make directions clear.",0
DO NOT take Nicastro unless you absolutely have to. He knows his stuff but is horrible in actually iterating it to his students. And don't get me started on his tests. They are a significant step up in difficulty from the homework. His finals are worse. Not to mention he reprimand us ons a daily basis for not understanding concepts (it's that bad),0
Lots of reading and one main paper (6-8 pages) at the end of the semester . Good professor though!,1
Gives you quizzes on things you didn't learn and grades them really hard. She's terrible please don't take her this is the biggest waste of a class i've ever taken. The class is 3 hours long and she barely gives you a 5 minute break and gets off topic onto the worst tangents then blames students for not knowing material. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!,0
"I want to hear the professor lecture to get a better understanding of these older texts. I don't understand why she insists on listening to other students opinions the majority of the class time. I get it, participation matters however we do not pay to hear fellow students' tedious musings. Enjoyed the material, not the professor.",0
Dr. Carter is such an engaging speaker. He is inspiring & thought provoking as he leads people in thought very effectively. Dr. Carter was very aware of his students' mental spaces; he managed a classroom with expectations & goals but at the same time he took time to lead us in meditation when we got burned out a bit. I see life differently now.,1
Awesome teacher,1
He will not curve the class. Made the course harder than it suppose to be. And does not want to help you in his office hours. Do NOT pick him if you can take it with someone else.,0
"I really admire the amount of organization Prof. Blake employs as well as the modernity of the material. The bulk of the class revolved around the first 5 chapters of the Portales textbook and all of our tests were open book. As a result, the class kind of felt like high school. In lectures, however, Prof. Blake always expanded on topics in detail.",1
Professor Jon Dunham cares for his students. If he sees that the class is struggling he will address the issue and help the class out the best he can. He sticks to the syllabus when it comes to essays and the portfolio but not with in-class assignments. Come to class and do the assignments and you will do perfectly fine.,1
"Most boring teacher ever! She lectures all class and puts people to sleep. The class teaches the basics of word, powerpoint and excel. Its suppose to be pretty easy if you know how to use these programs, right? NOPE there is so much homework due every week and there is a test every week. She thinks we don't take any other classes. NO NOT TAKE!",0
"Professor Jassen is very nice and cares about her students. I have a strong science background so this class was easy for me, if you don't have one you will definitely need to study a ton! The class was more of an intro to anatomy and physiology and less of the cell bio I was hoping for, however I still enjoyed her class. Would highly recommend!",1
IF YOU LIKE YOUR LIFE AND VALUE YOUR TIME DO NOT EVEN LOOK AT THE NAME JOANNE HOUSTON.... THE SMALLEST MOST MICROSCOPIC THOUGHT OR CONSIDERATION OF TAKIN A CLASS WILL DESTROY THE LEFT SIDE OF YOUR BRAIN SHE FAILED 28 OUT OF 30 PPL IN MY CLASS...SHE IS ILLOGICAL AND CONFUSED WITH HER OWN LIFE MUCH LESS TO HAV TIME TO CATER TO YOURS..DON'T DO IT!!!!!,0
Great teacher. Very funny and made things interesting,1
"TERRIBLE professor.  You must do all the readings or she wont even teach.  No one in the class ever read so you would keep skipping things.  Other people say she is good in other classes, but this one is horrible.  Never take this class.  She tests on the most random facts from the reading.  She is clearly the worst prof I've had at the U",0
"One of the worst professors at PCC. Teaching style is terrible and his notes dont correlate to the homework, quizzes, or tests. From using the equations he has taught us I have figured out that he is a poo poo teacher and that is the only equation I was able to figure out while taking his class. Dont take this class/professor if you want a future",0
"Awesome professor that pushes his students to do well in the class. Lots of different things are weighted to determine your grade, so doing poorly on a quiz or two is not a huge deal. Group projects are very fun and engaging. Professor McKnight is the man.",1
Awesome teacher! Very inspired and knows a ridiculous amount. And he's totally hot!,1
His lectures are pretty good and he explains concepts well. Homeworks and exam questions can be tough and thought-provoking at times. He doesn't provide solutions but you can go to his office to discuss. Although not an entirely approachable guy... Exams are open-book and usually similar to questions on old exams. ,1
Worst prof ever,0
I HIGHLY DONT RECOMMEND him!!! DONT LISTEN TO THESE THEY ARE WRITTEN BY HIM,0
"Professor Wood is the best. I'm so happy I took her. I wish all instructors were like her. Seriously, I'm telling the truth. She cares about her students. You do need you book. Take her class if you need or want to take COMSTD 2.",1
"Read this book, then listen to me re-read everything you just read in the most monotone voice ever. *Snore* Would be a useful class if I were going to teach in a class where I would give tests. Very boring, required class. Few tests. Few quizzes. Just a boring class with no incentive to study til the night before. Sucks the fun out of teaching. ",1
"The class I took with Dwosh was a nice class once a week. The class is very easy as long as you actually try. The books he assigned were very interesting and I'm glad I got them. Nothing special about him, but he is a good professor that teaches leadership in an engaging way.",1
One of the least caring professors I have ever encountered. He. Does. Not. Care. He is downright rude to students. I once mistakenly addressed him as Mr. instead of Dr. and he replied very rudely. AVOID!,0
"Professor Higham is a fine teacher, but he doesn't bend over backwards for you so you have to be pro-active in seeking him out to ask questions and visiting his office hours if you want help. He doesn't know how to explain difficult topics so that students can understand, so make sure you ask for clarification. Still, he will help you if you ask.",1
No Comments,0
A gentle giant. You basically read the textbook cover to cover so you'll get your money's worth. Discussion questions assigned each class and fosters participation. Has a large paper and the end of the term which is standard. What's nice is he will give you the grade as long as you put the work in aka all the DQs and class participation etc.,1
Horrible teacher. Never admits shes wrong. All she talks about is the steelers. She needs to talk about going to the gym because shes super husky. Overall weak teacher that gives women a bad name,0
"She has been one of the best professors I've ever had.  I would highly recommend her.  If you go to class, study her study guides, and do your assignments you will get an A in the class.  You have to write 3 papers and do 1 group project, all are easy and won't take up much of your time.  Take her if you can!",1
"Mi-sook expects alot from her students.  She will push you, but she always helped me when I needed it and helped me to refine my craftsmanship.  She can be a little harsh in critiques, but hey, it's a tough world.  The only complaint I have is that she makes students write in critiques.",1
Professor Jones made psychology interesting and fun to learn! I highly recommend this professor due to his engaging and hilarious lectures!,1
She is a sweet lady to your face but when she returns assignments it is as if she is Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde. She is not clear about what she wants and then takes off alot of points when its not up to her standards. Take her if you want to work your butt off and still get a bad grade.She is one of the toughest graders in the nursing program. BEWARE!,0
"Professor Galan is an extremely nice teacher. You can tell he loves his subject a lot. His class is very easy, attendance is not taken, but he gives a TON of extra credit for sign in sheets. No quizes, no hw. I would highly recommend his class!!",1
"This class was full of interesting content. The professor was a little forgetful at times, but overall a very nice person who was clearly very passionate about the subjects. I would recommend this class to fulfill the ethnic studies requirement or just for fun!",1
Scott is a great teacher.  He teaches with much clarity and makes Stats very tolerable.  Prior to this class I hated math and managed to get an A.  As long as you read the book (which is an easy read) and do the homework/labs you will do just fine.,1
"THOUGHT THIS CLASS WAS GONNA BE GOOD BECAUSE HE WAS SUCH A NICE AND LAID BACK TEACHER. HE DOESNT RESPOND TO EMAILS AND HE TALKS TOO MUCH DURING LECTURES, MAKING IT UNCLEAR ON WHAT TO STUDY FOR THE CLASS. VERY CONCEITED, TESTS ARE HARD. ITS NOT WORTH THE GEN ED.",0
She is no help. ,0
"Dr. Witelski is an awesome professor, and a great guy. He's always there to answer emails/questions in office hours. His class is extremely hard, but you can see the common thread of the class from beginning to end. The course is well designed and well kept, and I learned a ton in it.",1
"Awesome professor, and an awesome class",1
"Very good professor, was an easy A, he is the coordinator for Kinesiology and really knows his stuff. I would take him again if I could.",1
Mrs. Hanratty is wonderful!  She gives clear grading criteria and she gives good feedback on papers so you know how to improve. She cares about her students and wants you to succeed. She gives you plenty of time to work on assignments. I would highly recommend her if you want to learn something in English!,1
It is not difficult to do well in his classes if you go to class and listen to what he has to say ON TOP of what he has in his Powerpoint slides. He is a very nice person and  quite cheeky when he wants to be (he has perfected the stink-eye)! He is a incredibly knowledgeable and can be lenient with conflicting midtermassignment dates. Not so bad ,0
"His assignments are not clear. He does not explain his grading, he simply assigns a number or in my case a letter grade with no explanation. He can be very slow to answer emails. He also has a lot of work that is outside of class interviews, community service, etc. that makes it very difficult for an online class.",0
Great!,1
She likes to talk about her family and baseball more than accounting. I only took her again because I know what to expect from her. I've been in 2401 for a week and we haven't had any actual teaching yet. Can't wait for December.,0
"I have heard goo things about this professor, but please DO NOT TAKE if you are taking him online. He has no clue how to run and online class and we never meet. We doesn't add any assignment to the D2L calendar, so its a fun game of guess when the next assignment is due, at to top it off he take of 50 POINTS for one day late.",0
"The OB course was very demanding, the group project was difficult at best due to the restrictions for communication placed on it. The midterm and final exams were very challenging. The prof was primarily hands off and learning was primarily group discussions and posts. The course structure forced serious independence and leadership skills.",1
"Does not answer questions or gets angry if she does. Blabs more about authors than literature. Rushes students through presentations. Does not post clear directions about her assignment s. Fails too many students, in our class as well as at least one other she teaches. Gives very little explanation about her grade. Rude. Condescending.",0
"All I can say is DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF. I took him last semester, his test is crazy hard. NO REVIEWS TEST. A LOT OF HOME WORKS. He said that he have extra credits in EXAM. TRUST ME, you will never get 100% of the test. If you guys think that I didn't study and just blame on him. I HAD THE HIGHEST SCORES IN HIS CLASS BUT I CAN'T GET AN ""A"".",0
Karen is all about helping her students understand the math and being successful. She is clear and makes the math easier to understand.,1
Good lecturer loves teaching history and is energetic about it. Best thing to do is participate and do the assignments. Provides test guides for every exam.,1
"Take Micro with Powers, not Andersen.",1
"Best Class at UT- Brownlee is an amazing professor, attendance is not mandatory, material is actually interesting. Would take another class of his again. If you memorize the class made study guide, you will get an A. 3% extra credit. Highly recommend.",1
"LOVE LOVE LOVE HER! she is super nice, funny, responds to emails quickly. I don't have anything bad to say about her. I appreciate having her there as someone i look up to. She presents very clearly, connects with students if you make an effort, and has a wonderful personality",1
"You do not learn much in her class. She is a bad teacher. She lectures very little and the class structure is very disorganized. She knows the info but does not transmitted well to students. She does not know how to teach. This is a self-taught class. At least, she is very easy and her tests are very short. Most of the class is just busy work.",0
"she is a great teacher, i have had her for 2 classes now and she is greatly helpful in both classes. i would strongly recommend taking a class with her if you could",1
"DONT TAKE HER CLASS! You'll never get full credit. Nothing meets her ""standards"" even if you've followed all instructions to the T. She's one of those profs who like to take points off for nothing, but when asked she'll have no negative things to say. Very frustrating! Put in SO much effort, only getting a B. I feel I deserve 5 A's at this point.",0
"This class is not bad at all. If you already have practice in health science or basic bio, a lot of it is just review until you get into the nervous tissue section, which was the only section I had stuff I've never seen before on it. Its 4 exams and a final, and everything on her exams is from her ppts so if you study em you'll pass. Ended w/ a 95",1
Miller is not about info you could find online or pointless refinement. You feel as if you are making a new kind of knowledge It's heady. Miller starts where other St. John's English teachers can't imagine.,1
"I highly suggest to not take Dr. Bush pre-calc online course! Unless you are okay to teach yourself about this course with ""0"" lecture. The only way I could learn something was by doing the homework. Nothing more than that was ever offered. Theres 2 exams and no extra credit! Actually there was 5 points* thanks Wendy! but srly, do not take her!!!",0
"Great professor, very helpful with his students and always willing to help his students when they need to. The best math teacher I ever had.",1
"Easy, boring & useless",0
The best teacher that I ever had in my academic life.,1
"Professor Crowley is the type of instructor that is able to break down the concepts of chemistry in  way that's easy to digest. If your someone who has trouble in chem, take her class! All the notes, tests, and expectations are clearly defined and she gives you plenty of information to succeed. Don't cram! Work hard and you'll be absolutely fine   ",1
"Hilarious- keeps class interesting/worth attending. Hard topic- must study + do hw. Labs + bonus hw saved my grade. Very helpful, reminded us often of hw + tests. Attendance mandatory to pass, doesn't post slides online. Appreciates students who participate. Keeps it real with grades and life. Made accounting bearable. Can't find a better teacher.",1
"He definitely keeps your intrest during class. I liked him. You have to pay attention though, and his tests are a little difficult to study for, but nothing major. Just make sure to do the homework which takes at most 20 min. I'd recommend him",1
She's really not that bad. If you go to class and make sure you get a study buddy or get in a group you are good. You have to focus and take good notes during class because there is only one test and it's the final worth 50% of your grade. Overall I only had the class once a week and it was really nice. If you're willing to go to class its worth it,1
"Very easy, I got an A and hardly studied for anything.  He is a really nice and funny guy.",1
Dr Wilson is by far the worst professor I have ever had. She requires that your life solely revolve around her class. She assigned 400 question LearnSmarts due in 48 hours. She gives only 20 minutes for a 20 question quiz. She refuses to answer questions in class and calls you unprofessional for asking questions. She cannot explain things at all.,0
"Prof. Maojoudi was a good teacher, he taught at a fast pace that was hard to learn, but he made sure we understood by asking us if we had questions . The examples he used were great and is related to real life. His quizzes were ok, but his exams were hard. There is a 2 page essay and homework that you would have to do every week. Great experience.",1
"Terrifying and bizarre experience. ""Accidentally"" marked my answers wrong throughout the semester and then continuously denied it, repeatedly pretending like they had no idea what I was talking about. One of my exam grades went from a B to an A because of these erroneous deductions. Very, very scary.",0
"LOVED her so much! She is very kind, caring, intelligent, and such a sweetheart. The class was never overwhelming. I honestly enjoyed coming to her class. I highly recommend taking her. You will not regret it. This class does require observation hours, please DO NOT put that off and think you have all the time in the world to do it.",1
Very good teacher and he is also very funny. Pay attention in class and study even a little bit and you'll be more than fine.,1
"Too easy. If you are someone who is wanting to improve on grammar andor their writing skills, do not take him. He plays too many movies in classes, which I find to be a waste of my money I am putting towards the class to earn the credit. He could be rude at times to some. I would not recommend him.",0
"Do not take this class if you don't like politics. He is very dry when giving the lecture as it is easy to fall asleep or not pay attention. His grading criteria is mostly based on tests which he makes extremely difficult. The exams are short answer, multiple choice and essay. He also hardly gives extra credit and doesn't care about his students",0
"She has a very thick Russian accent, can be very difficult to understand at times. If you plan on missing class much, she isn't the professor for you.",1
Terrible teacher . Be aware she holds grudges. She gives a lot of notes but doesn't tell you anything about any of her tests. She expect you to eat breath and live the subject  and doesn't help you with any questions all she says it look through the notes. I would recommend staying away from her for many different reasons.,0
"This class by far the worst class I have taken at Troy. There is no study guide and the information on the test is confusing. The instructor really does not take time out to help you in the course, my advice choose another instructor.",0
"Terrible feedback. Tough grader. Choices in reading are okay, but she tries to make you think HER way, not critically. It's only HER interpretation & you have to guess. Makes a class that could be great miserable. Contradicts herself; is all over the place with the syllabus. Take this class with another professor! Not worth the aggravation.",0
"The lectures are dry, but, do your best to push through them and take excellent notes... You need to go to lecture to do well on the exams. There are two exams and one final, and one two-page essay.   You will be required to read many texts, although, I got an A without reading any of them. Don't waste your money, find them for free.",1
Very scary... She hardly understand your questions and her tests are very hard--8 choices for mc questions. Try to avoid her...,0
Do not take his course please. It is terrible! Tough grader,0
Class was somewhat boring. Test will seem easy if you study. Coming to class isn't mandatory but it's best that you always attend because it'll help you understand the material better and you'll fee more comfortable taking the tests.,1
She really wants her students to succeed. Genuinely nice person and very helpful.,1
"His classes were pretty dull, and he doesn't always touch everything that's on the test. If you don't have a book for this class, you would defiantly fail. Also, he likes to blame a lot of the bad grades he gets on his students. It's like he can't ever find fault in himself.",0
I loved Professor Henry-he was great! I would take another class with him given the chance. He gave clear direction and was extremely helpful. He doesn't move on unless the students understand what he has taught thus far.,1
She is super willing to help you if you ask her for more clarity. Willing to explain why you got the grade you did.,1
"Professor Schlortt isn't a normal history teacher, he is not date heavy, and unlike other professors' he understands that life happens, so he is flexible with due dates but don't take advantage of it.",1
not very clear when teaching. gives little direction on what to study-says the answers are all right their in front of u in the text but u will have a 10 question test on 30 pages form the boring text... hard to prepare for his class and exams.,0
"You need to buy SIMnet for this class ($90) cause thats where all your assignments are. Its an easy class, its just a lot of work online with Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. Also, the text book will help you with your tests so you should buy it!",1
"Prof Wittman was an excellent teacher.  Attendance isn't mandatory but really helps.  This guy tells great stories and illustrations which helped me learn the med terms.  He really knows his stuff and keeps the long hours from being a snooze fest. Plus, he's really good looking, which helps, too.  Lol",1
"This course was very intense but is easy to pass if you dedicate a lot of time to the weekly assignments. The weekly assignments tended to be very time consuming, though.",0
Killed any interest I might have in Spanish. An incredible amount of class time is spent with her rambling about her family in Spain. Please read other comments on this page--they are absolutely rght.,0
"He did a great job with really difficult material. (182) Does a lot in terms of providing opportunities for students to improve, and in return expects students to work hard. I like the lecture style--tests student knowledge with questions so you get an idea of whether your understanding the material or not.",1
"Dr. De Vos has a lot of bad ratings, which I disagree with. Yes, he does go off on tangents, but they always relate back to the lecture. He is one of the most knowledgable people I have ever came across, and I think students take that for granted. He is extremely understanding and extremely approachable. I took every class I could with him.",1
"Students only like Garyen because he is funny and caring in lectures. In terms of actually learning something in his class, chances are you probably have to learn it yourself. He's forgetful and sometimes tests you on material that you haven't even learned in lecture and not even found in the textbook which is unfair. He's not as hype as you think.",0
"Loved Creative Writing with Carlton. Chillest professor on campus. Talks a lot about his book, not that I minded. (It's a great book.) Brings up super interesting and relevant topics and has you read really good short stories. We watched a few movies too. The portfolios are not as scary as they sound if you keep up with the work. Awesome professor.",1
"final exam was a joke. focused a lot of class time to things that weren't even on the exam. the group project was so time consuming. he is not a nice person, doesn't have time to help you, doesn't answer his emails for days. avoid taking any class with him.",0
"She literally gives you ""short answer assignments"" but in reality its 2-3 paragraphs per question and there is 5 questions. Its just so dumb of a professor to do that. And during a pandemic. No sympathy. Avoid taking her",0
Does not relate lecture to its application irl or the purpose of why he teaches us things. Assumes you have all prior knowledge of an advanced topic in what is meant to be the entry level course.,0
Outstanding instructor. Does things different than others at Manoa.  He did his PhD on how to teach a second language and it shows. You'll get more from him than any other.  Highly recommended.,1
"There is no science in this course, which remains superficial and descriptive. The teacher is still interesting and cares about what he says. The calm of his voice and the lack of structure of his class and PPTs unfortunately don't keep us interested very long. You will easily pass the exam without attending class, or without reading the book.",0
"Just not an easy person to get along with, which is disappointing because she is a professor afterall",0
"easy easy easy A! He uses a website that shows videos on how to do the problems, and then you have a problem just like the problem in the video. If you get it wrong, you get reattempts to do them over to get them right. Make sure  you don't slack on the due dates of the assignments because you don't want to be behind. Take forever to catch up.",1
No Comments,0
"professor potion is a very cool guy. when it comes to teaching however, he kind of goes around your questions and makes you questions everything and it can be frustrating. the whole class you'll be confused and he only really teaches if you're in his group(there are three groups and he only teaches on of them).",1
"Precalculus is a ridiculously hard class so do yourself a favor and take it with Ryburn. She is so nice and always willing to work with you. She gives great feedback and actually cares about her students passing, no that doesn't mean its an easy A so be prepared to put in work!",1
"MATH122 is hard enough of a class as it is, especially to teach, but if Argerami is teaching it AVOID LIKE THE PLAUGE. The content of our class never lined up with SI, and Argerami was hard to understand with the way he went about doing his examples.",0
"I withdrew  from the class, as well as many others! We started with maybe 15 or more, by the time I dropped there were 6.  She did not teach the subject where the student could understand and retain the information! If you ask for help during class, her response is always ""Well..., I don't understand why you don't understand"".",0
"Get ready to teach yourself. She gets off topic ALOT and does NOT teach what will be on exams. The only hope you will have to pass is to go to SI sessions. The SI leader will teach more than Walling. She treats the class like kids, ex: congratulates us over knowing what H2O is and such. She is very nice, just not great at teaching.",0
"Knoop was difficult at best.  If you have a difficult time getting long with her it will be reflected in your grades.  She will even admit if she doesn't like you she's harder on you.  Following along in class is difficult, expect to run off topic at least three times a class. Her knowledge of the industry is dated at best.",0
"Stay away from her. Grossly unprofessional. Almost her entire class is failing. Her test averages are the lowest of all sections(multiple semesters). Insults students. Actually wrote up false paperwork about a student to retaliate against him filing a a complaint with dept chair. ""A"" students go become failing students in her class.",0
Doug Dowell is easily one of the best professors Ive had at ISU. His classes are very easy to follow because he cares about his students and their success. He makes it easy to understand things because of his knowledge and passion on the subjects. Highly recommend! He is such a nice guy and you will not regret it.,1
"I have taken this professors class online for summer 1 (5 week course). The good news is if you're taking another class you can put off this class until Monday becase that's when everything is due. The bad news, her tests are HARD she does give you an outline and review questions for each chapter but those won't help you for the midterm/final exams",0
"lectures are pretty straightforward. take lots of notes because those will help. the study guides will help too, but still take notes! it's not too boring. he's fair enough, and the class is pretty easy. tests are short answer questions, but know a lot of the terms.",1
"Professor Heilman does an excellent job engaging with her class through lectures, both asking and answering pertinent questions. She provided excellent lectures that kept students engaged and interested. Tests were fair and marking wasn't too harsh.",1
Love her!!! She enjoys what she is teaching. Tries to make the class more interesting by adding little activities. She is great!,1
Honestly a good guy that you can talk to. Unfortunately his lectures are extremely hard to follow and are super theoretical. A lot of over complication on simple topics. Self-studying is required to pass. Don't take unless you are super into theoretical math or confident about self-studying a lot.,0
"She's fantastic. Don't be scared off by her syllabus: it's intense, 8 pages long, and has footnotes, but that's because she takes the class seriously and expects you to take it seriously, too. If you make the effort, you'll succeed - and she's incredibly helpful. Made me a better writer, and I added a Philosophy major because of her class! ",1
I am taking the hybrid course. The in class portion can be interesting because he has guest speakers come in every week. But the homework assignments are worthless busy work. You have to write about 1000+ words a week and you are expected to BS those 1000 words because you could get your point across for the assignments in about 150.,0
"Worst professor I've had at Pitt. Lectures are just him deriving formulas. He never actually taught derivatives; just expected to know how to do them. Never posted any grades, just a letter at the end of the semester. Gave 3 pop-quizzes that probably didn't even affect grades. Tests were unreasonably hard and did not relate to the final in anyway.",0
"Professor McCleod is truly an awesome professor. He really cares about his students and their success in his class. He is very willing to go over material as much as needed during lectures and in office hours. He also truly enjoys when his students understand concepts. Tests can be difficult, but if you pay attention, they're not that bad.",1
Great class. Loved attending and the homework pushed you but was manageable. Super clear expectations and engaging.,1
Lectures were fun and she definitely made the material interesting. Great teaching style and was obviously very knowledgable about the subject. She was very understanding when it came to grading work. Would definitely recommend taking.,1
"I'm in professor Hartman's math class and all we do is get on the computer, on this website call Aleks and do work on there. There is so interaction with the class, no blackboard work or powerpoint and no text book. Please do not take this professor class you will be learn nothing at all.",0
"EXTREMELY HARD GRADER. Considering your grade is dependant on passing exams, it is a very precarious position to be in. Lectures are monotonous and boring, the lack of engagement makes it difficult to determine what is expected of you and what you are expected to know and gain from the class. Would honestly recommend any other prof in the dept.",0
"Sam is a really chill guy. I had a question one day after class and we ended up strolling around campus talking about random things for an hour.   That being said, he's not a very good lecturer. His lectures are really repetitive and confusing, especially for being so early in the morning.   The class is easy though; there is hardly any work.",1
"Not thorough. I am a very rigorous studier and, after giving it my all, I still felt I didn't understand. He doesn't seem to understand his own class! Unfortunate that he is the only one teaching ochem2 @ OCCC. My advice - take it somewhere else.",0
"He was an amazing professor, I took him twice at Hofstra. I know he is now teaching at a college in New Jersey, Kean University. A shame he left Hofstra.",1
"The only thing you need is the access code, didn't use the textbook. Attendance is not mandatory. I only went to class for a month and stopped. Everything is online aka, assignments and exams. If you go to class the day before and exam she'll tell you what's on the exam There is a research paper but it's for participation. Easy A. Would take again.",0
"I'll be honest here, I have never put in as much effort as I did with 116. I went to tutors, I went to the east wing, and numerous other places. I failed this class. Ontop of the confusing subject matter, he tends to ramble in class about barely related topics, such as the history of math. He is a nice guy, and is intelligen, but not a good teacher",0
"inspirational in his teachings, puts effort and character into lectures. lectures are LONG ,but meaningful. does a great job at explaining the importance of communication.",1
"Anne is one of the best professors I've had at Madison. She really listens and cares about your thoughts on the class and her teaching style. Our class ranged from Botany Grad students to non-science major Undergrads, and everyone still got a lot out of the course. I tell everyone I know to take this class",1
"Easy teacher, just make sure you do all the class work and study for test. She even gives you a study guide.",1
"While he is very knowledgeable in the arts, his teaching style is very mundane, so much so that it makes you disengaged in the learning process. I wouldn't suggest his class unless you are an art major, as the lecture is pretty heavy and there is a fair amount of reading involved. I also found him to be a tough grader, more than he needs to be.",0
I love this professor. Her classes are difficult but she is there and believes you can succeed. She is is wonderful professor and would recommend that everyone takes her course.,1
I absolutely hated this class. He really cannot teach and he is the worst professor I have ever taken. Assigned so many hw and it is not even on the test. Such a crappy class.,0
Prof Shively was awesome I had very little interest in her class but she made everyday interesting. Make sure to keep up with D2L !!,1
"The only class of mine this semester that I cannot wait to go. 11/10 would recommend it. His enthusiasm makes you want to study and learn in the class, always open for a good discussion and a conversation.",1
Great teacher. Very helpful especially in advising. Study the CD-rom and you are set for the tests.,1
LONG exams! 150+ question exams. Yes he gives you the review a week before but the review itself is 200+ questions that you need to find the answers to and remember them. Unrealistic. Don't bother complaining he won't listen/care. Attendance is mandatory. You lose points for not coming to class. Jams 5 chapters in one test because he's unorganized.,0
"Sarcastic, unhelpful, favors certain students and do not give attention to the rest, rude, always late for class, does not explain and expect students to know it all, have seen almost all international students dropping from her class. She exhausts students with long papers on top of readings and a weekly quiz. Spends the first hour of the lecture",0
"Awesome class with an awesome professor. He knows his stuff and gives great examples. Also, there's a movie night. How cool is that? Definitely take Rasheed for 107. Few things are graded so make sure to copy all of the Powerpoints and study those and you should be set.",1
"I dreaded every single one of her classes. She constantly gives the class lectures about how our class is lazy and dumb and that we should go to community college instead. After she explains her lectures she always asks, ""do you understand? yes or no?""  although this class is an easy A, i do not recommend it at all. ",0
Terrible teacher!!!!! You are tested on material that isnt taught yet. You take blackboard quizzes everyday. He will keep you late.,0
"Does not explain his grading for the homework, which is 50% of the total grade, lectures are fairly well organized but also fairly boring.",0
"Great teacher!this class makes you look at movies differently,gives you a study guide for all her test,papers are clearly explained,her project is a breeze..take this class!highly recommended!",1
"He is very opinionated, unorganized and annoying at times. But he seems to know his stuff. I took the class in the summer and its very difficult. He skips sections and veers off on other topics that have nothing to do with the course.. If you want to pass you have to read the book; the entire book. Front to back. Cover to cover.",0
"Terrible Terrible Terrible. I strongly suggest you do not take her. She marks unfairly, she takes forever to give papers back, she always plays the victim, says she wants to help but offers no help when it comes to your exam. Terrible!",0
Terrible prof. Shouldn't even be teaching anymore.,0
"Wasn't a big fan of Fetter.  His class consists of asking questions and watching Panoptos out of class, not the way I like to learn.  Quizzes and tests are lengthy and hard.  Likes students who ask questions and seem interested.  Doesn't really go off grading scale and curves, but class is difficult.  Go to review sessions and go to class.",0
Pretty easy class. Weekly quizzes that help prepare you for the test. his lectures are super helpful and I would definitely recommend going. The online hw is usually pretty easy and he usually makes them around 10 questions. Would recommend if you took precalc in high school and need a good refresher.,1
"This professor just does not seem to have any knowledge on teaching. He is extreamly unorganized, and you just cannot follow what he is saying. Honestly I don't think he has any intrest in his students.",0
"I would not recommend this teacher to anyone looking to fulfill the credit that this class gives. She takes a long time to respond to emails and requires attendance. She also uses the entire class time  each class session. If you take her, you will never be dismissed early.",0
"among the best graduate instructors I have had.  superbly organized lectures. tough class but he is extremly helpful and accessible outside class.  his youtube videos are really good, and online tutorial sessions solve lots of problems. He really does go above and beyond.  And he responds to email within the hour....",1
"I think Prof. Darman is decent enough. However, my main concern is that he lectures on tangents FOREVER. Honestly, if you are taking SOC 110 with him, the book is more of a learning tool than he is just because it's a test to focus on his every word. Other than that, surprisingly interesting at times and the writing assignments and tests are fair.",1
"Stephen Is my all time favorite math teacher. He teaches at a great pace and explains concepts in an organized simple way. However, I did not like the online math 111 class. If you are very good at math then go for it. If you are not good with math then never take and online one.",1
Horrible instruction. She rather talk about her personal life than explain what the class is doing wrong since apparently we make so many mistakes. She has handed out three pages so far and has not discussed any of the questions we answered for a grade. gives prompt for two passages to choose then pushes off the book never to talk about it again.,0
Prof. Regan is not clear. hard to understand. Poor at teaching. Got nothing from this class. Oh well.,0
"She was a really nice and warmhearted professor. She takes the time to meet with you and help you with your papers. Make sure to come prepared with questions though. Her grading is fair and she sees that you put effort, which will help you in the long run. She is always smiling and pleasant as well. Unifies the whole class into a  welcoming group.",1
"I'm not good at politics at all but this class helps me stay on top of what's going on and also it's very interesting. She challenges you to think ""outside the box"" so to speak, and encourages debate & disagreements. No papers for this class, only quizzes and exams that are all essays. I thought she's an easy grader given how I've done so far.",1
He is a nice person but he is a harsh grader and the majority of his classes is a waste of time. He goes completely off topic with different stories that have nothing to do with what he is teaching and by the time he is done the class is already over. Don't take him if you actually want to learn something during class.,0
"College of Engineering Dean. Lectures were difficult to follow and disorganized. Classwork (lab) and homework was meant to help students use technology to solve engineering problems, but I found it to be elementary and a waste of $263/credit hour. Nice guy, but disorganized presentations without a clear purpose. Recommend another instructor.",0
"Worst prof. ever. Made the class extremely difficult. Doesn't know what he is talking about. Not clear, not helpful, just a all around D!ck. Made sexest commments which he thought nothing of. He should be fired before given another class to teach. If you want to fail take him, if you want to pass and understand the material, stay clear. DO NOT TAKE",0
"I took Dr. Jacobson's class fall 2018. Her class is super easy and she is hilarious. She drops the 2 lowest quiz grades as well, which is super nice. Half of the classes were activities and the other half were lectures.",1
"Okay teacher. If you study hard and review your notes, you should do fine in the class. Also, book is not needed in class. You'll do fine with just your notes.",1
"Do not under any circumstances take this course online over the summer. There is a lot of forum responses to be made; however, the biggest problem is that he expects them to be done basically on the daily and you can't do them ahead of time. This made my weeks miserable as I couldn't go anywhere after work bc I had to go home and write a response.",0
Best teacher ever.,1
"Scheduled another prof. and got Nicastro. If you want to get yelled at and feel stupid for an entire physics lab take Nicastro. As the chair of the department, he was teaching a very low level physics lab and was taking it wayyy too seriously.",0
"I don't think Dr. Self is a bad professor because I did get an A in one of his tests, but Dr. Schroeder made the class a lot harder than it needed to be and that is Dr. Self's responsibility since he is the head instructor. Record lectures (for Dr. Self) and learn all the pathways that exist. I wanted cellular metabolism :/ this class was veryhard.",1
"You will never fall asleep in Graham's lectures. He keeps them very interesting and rarely goes on tangents. The course work was difficult as expected, but whatever you do, do not get behind on homework. All in all a great professor who loves what he does, answering questions, and has a deep understanding of math.",1
His lectures are long. Take notes and record on your phone. He goes so fast that you have to go back and listen and rewrite notes. Too much information per test! Gives extra credit opportunities.,1
"She talked to her class like we were in pre-K. She was completely unhelpful, the program glitched (almost everytime), and the tests were so hard. She's definitely one of the worst teachers I've ever had. DO NOT TAKE HER.",0
Dont know why she appears to be so mean on our marks: the lecture room is far from the other lecture buildings but she will always start the participation questions at the very beginning of the class? She doesn't consider if people would get injured on a slippery road when rushing from another classroom far from hers. Tends to give everyone lowmark,0
"Dr. Watts is an amazing professor, she was very laid back and interacted well with the class. She gives amazing feedback on your essays and if you ever need help she will always answer emails or will meet in her office. She super nice and a great professor to take English with.",1
"Many of my friends I have talked to about UI100 say how their classes are blow off classes and they do little to no work. In this class, I felt as if it was all busy work. I was never doing anything beneficial towards my education, I was simply wasting paper by filling out ""workbook pages"" for homework every night.",0
"I took Mr. Stanglin's online 2306 Texas Government class and it was a breeze. As someone who has never understood government at all, Mr. Stanglin had a way of explaining it to where it was so easy to read into it. His instructions are very clear and easy to keep up with it. Would definitely take another class taught by him.",1
"I have always been a straight A student, and I wish I would've found the website before taking this class. Currently, I am in HIS1112 with Dr. Crews. He provides no help, ridiculous midterm and final, no study guides or preparation. This was my very first college class and thought it was going to be the death of me.",0
"Professor Freedman is a great instructor. He is accessible, extremely knowledgeable, and passionate. He pulls together lectures in a way that made me connect the dots about big issues on globalization. Style: lectures (he does best) and class discussions (ok facilitator) He is realistic about college level work so you might have to do some.",1
"He's great! Take him if you have problems in Math as he will explain everything. Homework is due about every week over the online access. Exams are open book, open notes but not to take lightly. He grades nicely, if you are on the right track, he'll give you a lot of points. I would recommend to take him if you have heard ""the bad"" about FINA 311.",1
"Smart,  but not the greatest at teaching.",0
The best teacher I've evee had! Take Danny you will be enlightened! There is something so appealing about him too ;),1
Angie Kolen is the reason I was excited to wake up for my 10:15 chemistry class.. just because her human kinetics class came right after it ended! She is son inspirational and her lectures are never boring .,1
"Mrs. McGee is THE best professor I have had! She gives great lectures, and despite the fact that she may go on tangents, they're typically some way or fashion related to her lecture, and if they aren't, they're great mood lighteners. She also does not require a textbook, and her tests and quizzes are directly from her lectures. TAKE HER IF YOU CAN!",1
She was all over the place!,0
"Scott is a super nice guy who will keep you awake during class! If you do the readings, you will do just fine in this class. He has no tests, but a few quizzes to make sure your reading. He likes to keep the class involved during class and his lectures are super interesting. Strongly recommend taking him if you get the chance.",1
"The course covers a lot a material, so you have to go to class and spend a lot of time reviewing the PowerPoints. The teacher is organized, which helps. Plus, exams are straightforward.",1
"Ive had trouble with math all my life. I'm 50, Mr. Narin is the FIRST teacher I have ever had that made math easy for me to understand. He will work with you, just talk with him. If you dont say anything you can't blame him for not helping you.",1
"Professor Humber is young, but definitely knows what he's talking about. He is also very sensitive to the fact that students have different amounts of background knowledge. He is completely willing to answer any questions or to clarify anything. His instruction is very straight forward & clear. The homework that he assigns correlates w instruction",1
"He is fun, I enjoyed this course, it was a break in my schedule. To be honest, he is not very knowledgeable about software engineering or computing in general, but I still appreciate his humor. If you go through the slides and read the book yourself you'll be good and probably this will be your best course.",1
"The homework and quizzes are online, so you do not need to purchase a textbook if you do not want to. He is a nice person and can really help. I would recommend him.",1
"Materials kind of hard but go to class , do all the homework and listen when he tells you what will be on the quizzes and you'll do fine. 4 quizzes and he drops the lowest grade",1
I have a problem with him making us buy his book during class.,0
"If you need a science class take him, easiest class ever; it's almost impossible not to get an A. Only gives three exams, and he gives out study guides, and literally puts the same thing on the exam. I did not pay attention in class and I just made sure I studied the guides and I got a 100%. He's also really nice and super chill.",1
awesome class. so fun and creative. linda is awesome. if any problems just go talk to her!,1
"Professor Caramento, is very nice. He gives very good feedback when it comes to assignments. Would recommend his class if you are interested in African studies or if you need an elective. If you make the effort you will get a good grade in his class",1
"I received 88-95s on every exam, yet even if I get a 100 on the final, I can not get an A in this class. Giant flaw in his grading system. He does not respond to emails. Exams are 95% of the class and homework is completion. He can be funny in class but also very sassy. Homework every night with videos that you are required to watch.",0
If you value education do NOT take her. She is awful for an undergrad student who needs this to get into the Ed program. Her grading is horrendous and unnecessarily tough. Please if you listen to anyone just hear me out. Drop her if you get her!,0
"Wasn't as easy as I expected. The most challenging thing about his course is that he has been recycling material for over a decade now. The lectures, homework's, and projects are vague. At times he can be very rude, and at times he can be helpful. Be sure not to put off the projects until finals week. No late penalty for submitting late homework.",0
"2 reflection papers that are pretty easy, 2 exams and a final. Have to go to class, notes are very important. Did not do any of the readings and just took notes during lecture. She is very friendly and helpful during office hours. Class does sometimes turn into a debate due to the content, but overall it is a good class. Take notes, you'll get an A",1
Fenster incorporates Chemistry into History making for great lectures and an even easier time trying to learn the material. Solid Prof!,1
"Very knowledgable and charismatic with his words. Does not know the meaning of ""conceptualizing"" he does not know the art of teaching. His classes and test are all about specific details which are impractical for students.",0
"She gives quizzes at least once a week. She expects you to read the book and know everything before she teaches. Shes a hard grader and when she says you just need to know the basics, she doesnt really mean it. Theres a lot of material in a short time. Shes strict about attendance and theres no such thing as makeup or late work.",1
She seems great.,1
"Her accent is a little tough. Grading is clear. Compared to other professors, her class is better to take.",1
"Like others have mentioned, the material itself is easy, but she made it really hard by giving a ridiculous amount of homework, with mandatory attendence of lectures, tutorials, and weekly quizzes. This is not high school, and learning should be independent at unviersity. Students should have right to decide which learning style best suits them",0
Daigle's microeconomics class was very difficult for me. He's not a good lecturer. He mumbles a lot and doesn't want to explain things to you when you ask him about them. He is quite sexist also. His tests are very hard and even with a curve applied. I got a's and b's in every class but his.,0
She prepared me for the bar exam in such a way that I scored in the 96 percentile on the Feb 18 Bar. By far the best professor I had in law school. She ran class in such a way as to create a learning environment without distractions. Her professionalism was unparalleled in comparison with other professors.,0
great teacher! so helpful!!=),1
Extremly boring class. She is very unorganized. Tough Grader. Missed class quite a few times.,0
"Attendance is mandatory. He is hard to follow in class. If you don't have any prior knowledge of accounting you will be very confused. Do not take it if you want to actually learn accounting, because you won't. It is easy to pass without knowing anything. He knows what he talking about but doesn't know how to teach it & don't bother asking question",0
"DON'T DO IT. Ryan is very popular with the Advertising students for the lower division classes, but for ICC (Campaigns), he's the most lackadaisical and vague professor to pick. Your grades are pretty much based on his opinions, so you can follow the rubric and STILL get a crappy grade. Instructions are unclear and his organization of the class sux",0
hard to get ahold of,0
"Two assignments every week that are philosophical questions. Five exams based on the lectures. Gives you two chances to take them. Two easy questions to answer every week and paper. Honestly, every review before me is accurate. Sweet guy and a boomer who really tries his best to teach during these times. Easygoing class, def recommend!",1
"He wants to see everyone succeed but he also wants to see the effort. He does not curve or give extra credit. He gives partial points on the test. His tests come from homework, class & textbook examples and old tests. Homework was challenging but could be googled (but you should still try it). And watch out for the multiple choice! They're tricky.",1
Uniteresting,0
"I really enjoyed taking Kildea's class! He's a super funny, down-to-earth guy and his class is easy. I would definitely recommend taking his class!",1
HOT HOT HOT HOT MAN,1
"Great teacher! Really interesting guy and he's really passionate about English and writing. We always had great discussions in class. There are a couple novels you need for the class, but for the most part you read short stories online. Two papers, one midterm test that's pretty easy.",1
He's clear and fair and very willing to help. He knows his stuff and is willing to teach so long as you are willing to learn.,1
He is really smart and can be really funny. Five books of Moses was one of my fav. Bible courses of all time!,1
Would not recommend this teacher to non english majors. He knows a lot and wants us to know a lot but most of the time it has nothing to do with the assigned text. He's funny and extremely experienced. Lets you rewrite essays for a better grade. His lectures can be tortuously long if you're not interested in English or history.,0
"Dr. Avila was amazing. From day 1 she made it so that everyone became friends before the first class ended. we had 4 chapter exams and 1 final. about 4 or 5 lab reports (2 typed) and my class had 15 quizzes that were either ... group, individual, entire class participation. she drops like 4-5 quizzes, gives tons of extra credit!! love her",1
Liebling is the BEST lab professor you can get. I missed 2 labs and he still gave me an A. VERY understanding and goes out of his way to accomodate your needs. The field trip is definately worth the extra credit-- and so are his drawings!!,1
"Great professor! She provides you with all the help needed but don't expect to get an easy A. You have to study for exams and show up to class for attendance. There's one group project, fairly easy. She provides extra credit opportunities so you should def be fine!",1
"My favorite professor at Cal, period. I agree with what others said, I just wanted to to add that she is so helpful in office hours and when she graded my essay it was the most marked up paper I've ever gotten back--I learned a lot just from her comments on my paper. In her class you never forget why you love English; her passion is contagious.",1
"Also, pay attention to her previous semester's tests as she will base her exams on them, wink wink, nudge nudge ;) No way you can't get an A in her class ^__^",1
"Reads off powerpoint, doesn't explain anything. When she tries explaining she messes up and only confuses you more. Students corrected her on every quiz and exam because there was something wrong. Heavy accent which makes her more difficult. No curving, class grades are set lower although. Easiest Ochem professor at CSU although,just teach yourself",0
Dr. Carson is a model english teacher. He starts the year out by having you write a short essay. This essay doesn't count but he uses to show you how he grades and what he expects. After this I never got below a 93 on a paper. Very involving during lectures. And cares about his students and is very helpful with all things kennesaw.,1
Outrageous expectations for students in an INTRO(!!!!!) to ASL course. Will not slow down to help students who have trouble. Syllabus full of threats...serious attitude problem.,0
Really great!,1
"I took this class online. It was very easy and interesting. If you do the work, you'll do fine. She is a very fair grader.",1
"Lectures were a big waste of time, had to buy 5 different books - all of which were poorly written & uninteresting",0
"She's a great professor, make sure that you are attentive to the different assignments that she is handing out and their due dates. Great class and Great professor.",1
He is a professor that doesn't care for his student's grades. He gives the same assignment multiple times and is not specific with what he wants so he will take off unnecessary points just because he feels like it. Wouldn't recommend taking him. Also makes you buy textbook and we NEVER used it.,0
"Not helpful, only class I have ever failed, I got migraines because of this class! Awful! ",0
"Good teacher but gives a ridiculous amount of homework. Try 5-10 assignments a week; oh & there are 5 papers. Additionally, many of the assignments seem like busy work that she doesn't even grade based on effort/quality. If you do poorly on an essay or miss an assignment, it wont matter bc there are so many assignments to balance out low scores.",0
Really great teacher! He is very passionate about economics and will always do his best to help you. The homework is directly related to the tests but definitely make sure you take good notes too.,1
She is a very tough grader and is super picky on papers. Her tests are dumb as well. Her teaching is dead boring and she is very mean. Avoid at all costs.,0
Excellent teacher and class. I learned a lot and highly recommend.,1
"By far the worst professor I have ever had. Very scatterbrained, doesn't have a marking scheme for exams. All the questions are open ended even though you are given the questions before the exams. Doesn't know what is the right answer for examinations and not willing to give extra marks, even if you have one portion right, if another part is wrong.",0
"He is a wizard in mathematics, I personally used to think maths is hard, but he made it way easier than I thought. he uses more than one method to teach, so its left for you to choose what you are comfortable with. He is a good listener and very patient. There is a lot of homework and assignments but he will give you time to do it. Lots of fun.",1
"If you want to major in literature, this class is for you.",0
"Not friendly at all, very unaproachable. Can't use the required book for reference, because when you are in her class you are in ""SHAMANE LAND,"" therefore you do things her way. After 19 classes at LCC, she is definitely at the top of my worst list.",0
"Dr. Goodyear was definitely a challenging professor. If you differ from his view he will try to belittle you in front of the class. When his beliefs do not align with scripture he does not engage in meaningful conversation but instead shuts you down. In addition, two tests dictate 50% of your overall grade and 11 essays decide the other 50%.",0
I'm getting A's in all my other courses but did terrible is his. Class is 2 midterms and a final and he's a terrible and unfair marker. He'll only accept the answer he is looking for and will even give 0 on questions out of 10 if you don't write specifically what he wants (even if what you say on the topic is factually correct and from the notes).,0
"He's such a nice guy. He will give extensions if you are sincere. He cares about your time and will give you good feedback on papers. If you follow his rubrics and advice, your grades will reflect it.",1
Be prepared to have Lab and bookwork ready by test date. She does give twothree chapters in one day. Does not review before test. You have to download labwork grades or email but if emailed sometimes you get a zero. ,0
"To all my non-music majors needing to take Music40 to fulfill their Arts & Humanities G.E., TAKE THIS CLASS. Mr. Knapp is a great Professor. The class is work heavy, I wont lie, but it is truly effortless. All the exams given (7) are based on lecture/online assignments. If you study, theres no way you will get anything but an A.",1
"i do not like him at all. he seems so full of himself. he is not understanding, yet everyone understands him and respects him. he has this attitude i dont like. it's a very hard class, confusing, impossible to catch up. i studied so much for so many hourse and guess what his test question was? Who is the author of the textbook?",0
"Worst teacher ever!!! Tough greater, doesnt even teach but expects you to know everything and she will report you if you forget to cite anything. Shes absolutely terrible this lady should be fired, not a teacher at all!",0
"I picked her due to great reviews, BUT that may only be in class. DO NOT take her online! Had her for Summer 2. Only 4 assignments w/ a low grading scale (15,20,20,20)- No room for human error. Doesn't care to give a good feedback even when asked. Non-existent. Not her problem. I'd never take her again! I've had way better online class experience",0
Ok all the rates cross them out. SUCH AN EASY A dont even have to stay sign in and leave supper easy course 3 exams all online easy to cheat all answers are on quizlet and one group project a 4th grader can do! Deff him take lol strong accent tho,1
I took Eng 1b online and I had a good experience. You definitely need to put in the work to earn your grade but if youre willing to do so and attend office hours for extra help I would recommend the class. Lots of essays and readings but final project was fun.,1
He is very straight forward about grading.....12 quizes (2 lowest dropped) and 4 non-cumulative exams.  Be prepared to take a lot of notes and study a lot.  He is very helpful if you have questions and really knows his stuff.,1
"This professor actually believes you would be paid ""the big bucks"" to do complex calculations by hand. He assigns much more homework than other professors teaching the same class, however, he doesn't cover the material or work examples. Your only resource is the book and the lecture notes he posts. He provides a pdf book which saves money. Avoid",0
"Terrible. Unclear lectures, exams too long, no sense for basic things like class prereqs/posting homework solutions before exams, talks too much about how simple the concepts are/how everyone should get them (several times/lecture). Homework was lectures ahead of us conceptually more than once. And all this was *before* classes went online.",0
"Good god, these reviews are terrible. He gives out notes, eliminating the need for a textbook and still manages to follow a curriculum that can teach anyone the basics of control design without being a savant in differential equations. Anyone that doesn't like this course should drop out because they don't even want to work for their degree.",1
"She's really nice if you get on her good side. The class is hard and she's very passionate about the subject, so be prepared to work really hard! Talks forever but if you start your work while she talks in lab you'll get out faster; take good notes in lecture and you'll be fine!",1
Keval is a decent/mediocre professor. It should have been a fairly easy course but somehow she made it very difficult when it came to grading.,1
"He's called Prof Awesome for a reason.  Compared to all the other profs we've seen this year, he is truly #1.  Wish he could teach everything - which I bet he could.",1
"She is a great professor and is more than willing to help if you have any questions. Some of the material is difficult to understand, but she goes over it in class to try and make it clearer. Very little homework, mainly just some worksheets that go over the math that is introduced.",1
"I think the curriculum for SPAN302 is poorly designed, with too much busywork, both in class and for homework, and not nearly enough opportunities to have conversations and actually learn Spanish. With that said, Professor Newall did his best to work with it, and he is a very caring professor, so I'm sure he will improve, as this was his first year",1
-_- he never responds to my emails and get ready to read 40+ pages in a huge textbook with small print every week and doing a lot more bs a week DONT choose this guy,0
"He's a behavioral professor, so he's really encouraging and gives really good feedbacks to all his students. Two short writing assignments he calls projects and will take the time to email each student individually and give them good feedback and an easy A. His study guides are helpful- study them, they are exactly what is on the exams.",1
"Hard to summarize this course because Carter makes it a kind of overwhelming total experience of intellectual life. Nice balance between being really demanding and also being really chill about how demanding the class could feel. I'll remeber this class forever. Tibetan bowl meditation wa so good. A few short papers, long readings, and final paper.",1
he was my advisor on the study abroad trip to england... what an amazing guy he is!,1
"This is graduate class to expect to keep up on reading, participate in discussions and write a few long papers. She is a wealth of knowledge and more than willing to help. Super organized and returns assignments promptly and with quality comments.",1
"Have a question in class? Don't bother asking, she will tell you ""you should know this,"" (and move on). Want to know the subjects on your upcoming exam? Too bad, she will beat around the bush as much as possible to make things 10x more difficult. If you are looking for a teacher that will make learning almost impossible, this is the one for you!",0
Worst teacher ever in the whole universe!!!! Did all my work not even miss one paper or a class and he gave me my first D ever.He expects 101 work when he does not teach it!!!!!,0
"She obviously has a great amount of subject knowledge and personal experience with Asian studies, but she is a very poor presenter. Her lectures are long, boring, scattered. Use Wikipedia if you want to know what's going on. ",0
Stay as far away as you can from this class he is a nice guy but he flips the switch on you quickly if you miss an assignment. If you have no options then GROUP CHAT is all I can say and make sure you message each other so you dont miss an assignment,0
unorganized and grades pathetically hard! most students dreaded the class,0
A lot of material needed to remember for tests. Quite specific and a lot of weird names of sites and types of people and time periods you have to remember. Was a difficult course for me.,0
"Sometimes it is hard to understand his Texas accent but he means well. He was late to our classes sometimes but wasn't strict with us about things like that, so he's fair. The class was pretty easy overall. Brown used the previous prof's syllabus, so no surprises. Not a great teacher compared to the others here but he's new and still learning.",0
"Well, this is the last lecture he'll ever teach, so it doesn't really matter.  But he still sucks.  An especially big thanks for asking questions on the midterm & final that weren't even in the lecture notes.",0
"I loved his class! Great lectures, easy assignments. The tests were online, open book and open notes. If you listen to the lectures, and read the chapters, the exams are an easy-A! He gives extra credit to replace your lowest exam score, and the online discussion board is a grade booster. My class loved him, if you are in college to learn take him.",1
"Will is an awesome professor ... you learn a lot from his class, but he doesn't demand much.  Incredibly laid back, and very dedicated for an adjunct.  Rock on, Will.",1
"I hate the lab from his TA, seems like they are going to fail all students",0
"Kathy is one of the best journalism profs I've taken at CMU. She is very knowledgable and is fun to listen to. She gives quizzes online and does in class and out of class assignments. As long as you show up and present her with some effort, you will pass. I ended up with over 100% based off extra credit opportunities she offered.",1
"Pemberton, S is far too tough in her grading of exams and assignments. Pemberton needs to realize she is not in the court room or a university class room. Avoid taking her if you are reading this.",0
"He is such a great professor that I would swallow anything that he offers, and I mean anything.",1
hes okay buts confusing,0
"She allows students to learn bits at a time than at the end bring it all together. After every class, I feel truly inspired by the story she shares that are always applicable to what we're learning. She taught me more than how to be good writer, she taught me how to see the bigger picture in life to take it one day at a time and to fail forward.",1
Very tough prof.. make sure to attend every class or else you will pay the price.,0
"The best teacher/professor I've had to this point, he makes history fun and easy to understand with his absolutely stunning and electrifying lectures! And surely, this professor rating website is a Monumental Moment in Media History? Grading wise, just pay attention and take notes, and you'll be fine. Highly recommend, great experience overall!",1
"Class sucks, might as well be reading out of the textbook. Most of his students fail. Dont do it. Loves to talk about his college experience and college football thats about it. Tests cover chapters he didn't go over.",0
"Great guy, really helpful and nice. Down to earth. I wish i had him for ENG 105.",1
This guy is funny! Good PowerPoint. Make sure you have a good pen to take all the notes. He does not e-mail or post the PowerPoints. This is one of the best teachers that I have ever had and I am gradumated!,1
Dr. Maril makes class super interesting. He doesn't use power points because his class is mainly open discussion based on facts. I would take him again just because I actually wanted to go to this class. He made it interesting and he was straight forward about whats going to be on the test. Make sure the take notes on the discussions and youll pass,1
Professor McCracken is an amazing teacher. She is respectful to every student and wants to see everyone pass. The class has a lot of material and the end of the semester is rushed but she does a great job at explaining the lectures. Homework is a must as she gives homework quizzes which are graded.,1
"Took Congress with him. It was pretty good. He's definitely knowledgeable and a good dude. Seems like a geek at heart. Also took Political Inquiry aka PoliPrison, was easily the best lecturer.",1
Horrible Instructor. Does not communicate whatsoever. Pretty much getting paid for setting up blackboard & leaves you on you own afterwards.,0
"Absolutely the best professor. Dr Cleveland's passion for marketing is infectious, and he sprinkles fun anecdotes from his life experiences into the material to help explain difficult concepts. His exams are difficult, as he requires you to recount both textbook & lecture material quicker than a Catholic reciting a Hail Mary. Work hard  good grade",1
"Scott is very smart, but too smart to teach. He just doesn't explain things well or clear. If you are strong in math you'll be fine but if you need things explained I would look for a different professor.",0
"Not a nice experience, she is very unpleasant and mean even to those people working very hard. You will regret taking her classes.",0
If you think organic chemistry is hard you thought wrong. This class content is easy but the professor needs to work on his presentation and come up with his lecture instead of reading off the slides word for word. If that were the case might as well just take this class online.,0
Just read off the PowerPoint doesnt make his own PowerPoint uses the book so get ready to not need over half of it but he wont make his own so you really have no idea what youre studying at home. Just lectures youre not interacting with a 3 1/2 hours at all. For someone who has a learning disability get ready to be very challenged. NSCC,0
"Very sweet and helpful. Seems like a professional in her field. But she says one thing and then later says and does the opposite. Unreasonably tough grader. The class had some of the most interesting topics for me ever, and the most annoying teacher ever.",0
"Il parle surtout d'histoires personnelles et de lui durant les cours, n'explique pas très bien et ne fait jamais d'expemples au tableau il fait simplement montrer le corrigé des exercices et commenter rapidement. Bref, je ne recommande pas ce prof!",0
"Dawn was a very hard teacher, she expects you to know all the material already. In class there is 5 mins of instruction and its basically her telling stories about her job that don't connect to what you are learning. Class time is 2 hours of study so be prepared for that. She doesn't teach the material, you will have to learn it on your own.",0
Dr. King's class was horrible. He literally doesn't lecture about the material but rather posts various documents and makes you hunt for the information you need. Very unclear expectations about what he wants you to learn. When you do ask for clarification in class he hardly ever answers the question and just puts you in groups to figure it out.,0
"Great lecturer. Expects you to put the effort in, and if you do that, you'll learn a lot. The guy has an excellent sense of humor as well. His assignments are laid out with crystal clarity on MyCourses as well. The textbook will help you clarify any concepts or events you might be confused about, and gives you good context for his lectures. ",1
"The midterm research paper and final count for like your whole grade, so the other stuff barely  matters! She is VERY broad on what will be on the tests, and most are short answer ques. & essay. Teacher is not friendly or helpful at all!!!",0
"This teacher is very easy but she treats us like middle school kids!I feel that she doesnt care if we learn the material as long as we follow directions, make sure u do EVERYTHING when u do homework because if u miss one question she dosnt give you credit at all !! oh and bring your books EVERYDAY even if you dont use them!!!other than that shes ok",1
"Very nice lady and can tell she is passionate about what she does, but does not communicate with the students well. She doesn't follow the syllabus and is scatter-brained. However, it is a somewhat-easy class and is an easy grader. She does boring lectures and if you hate group projects, you're gonna hate this class because it is nothing but that. ",0
Not my favourite prof for a course that requires clear explanations. His slides are very detailed and he tries to engage the class but he's not an interesting lecturer. His assignments seem straight forward until he tries to explain how to complete them; very vague and confusing instructions which makes them harder than they should be.,0
Would not recommend ever taking a class with this prof! She is very unorganized and scatterbrained during lectures. When she does not use power points it is very difficult to follow along. Class is extremely boring and she is unable to answer questions from students. She also is very unclear when it comes to tests and assignments.,0
"Not bad, not great. Lectures are just cut-and-paste PP presentation's of the readings. Class is an easy A if you go to class, take notes, and write a good paper. If you need an easy GenEd, take Olsson. If you're looking for more in-depth study of the subject, look elsewhere.",1
"AVOID THIS MAN AT ALL COSTS. He is the meanest, most arrogant professor I've ever had. He is not approachable. When you do talk to him, you will walk away feeling like the dumbest person alive. He is incredibly condescending and rude. His criticism is often unnecessarily CRUEL and unhelpful. He should be teaching grad students, NOT undergraduates.",0
"Her class is super easy, you have 3 tests and the final. The tests come straight from the reviews, so study them a bit and you'll have an A in the class. Class is super easy and she wants her students to do well. Take the class, you'll pass. ",1
"According to my understanding he said is his first time teaching at BMCC. He looks like would like to help you, and he really know the subject but unfortunately he need more experience in how to teach. So lets give him a chance to make improvement. He do not use slide show, that could help him to teach.",1
Hardest class I have ever taken.,0
"ECON 227 was a train wreck on the administration side (lost exams, grades never coming back, etc.), but KMack cares a lot about his students. If you go to class and put in enough practice before his exams, you're very likely to get an A (plus you get to hear his awesome bagpipe playing at the end of each semester :D ).",1
Weekly discussions due @ the end of every week & is pretty easy about grading them. He has a group assignment (3 page paper) & a research paper (4pages). Weekly quizzes and require a lot of reading and studying to do good on them. They are short but can affect your grade if you do poorly on them. He is understanding and helpful. i'd take again,1
"His class was easily the most informative class I took while at UM. Lots of required reading, and lectures while not mandatory are incredibly dense and need a ton of notes or you wont pass. My one big turn off is he seemed to be more proud of who he knew, and had dinner with than the actual subject itself.",0
I got to say. Im currently enrolled in her online psych 1 class and its not like the typical psych class. She treats discussions lile english exams and the topics are so mediocre on discussions,0
"Dr Ouyang knew the subject matter very well.  Text Book was a waste.  Current events portion was good in that we had to explore issues with other students.  Online homework app was poor.  Two papers and a final exam were required.  For a non-accting major, it was a lot to absorb in such a short time.  I did learn the topic thoroughly though.",1
No Comments,1
"Despite the seeming lack of effort to convey during class, he is a genuinely kind soul, and he always responds to emails in a timely manner and he is more than willing to help when you ask for it. The class was canceled several times but he was so apologetic every time. The class really was not that hard, and he was overall very understanding.",1
"One of the best teachers I've ever had. The material can be dry sometimes but he makes it interesting and puts it in context well. He's super knowledgeable, had a lot of experience in the industry, and it shows. I'm trying to take a class from him next semester, mostly just because he's teaching it.  If you care about music, take this class.",1
LOVE LOVE LOVE Dr. Ferriera. I just finished taking her English 101 class and I loved it. She's hilarious and truly cares for her students. She makes it easy for you to succeed. She will drop your lowest grade if you need it. But also make sure you attend her class because she grades your participation in the lectures.,1
Goes super in-depth more than you need to know she thinks that we are all medical students,0
Be prepared to work hard! Professor Bronie is very helpful and she has office hours before each class if you ever don't understand the material and need help. If you miss class you will miss out on a lot!,1
"While I have a rather large disdain for all Humanities classes, this class in particular wasn't all that enlightening.  It was really specific in the opinions and bias' we experienced as a whole throughout the class and it seemed like the holistic view of the class was trite and redundant.  Nearly worthless class.",0
"Overall a great teacher. She offers so much extra credit its impossible not to get a good grade. The content itself is really hard, but she understands the struggles that we go through as students and is willing to talk.",1
"Nice guy but not a great teacher.  He goes off on tangents all the time and ends up having to cover a ton of material in little time because of it.  We covered too much information too quickly.  The entire class consisted of slide shows, which just about put me to sleep everyday.  Boring class, but it was interesting to learn abt human tendencies.",0
"please avoid this prof, one of the worst professor i ever had",0
"Really interesting class covering most of the main types of drugs.  Only one test and it's take home, the rest of your grade is made up of discussion, open book reading quizzes, and a final project on pretty much anything you want related to the class.  ",1
"Quite honestly the worst professor Ive had in a while. She was almost completely absent from the course the entire semester. Never answered emails in a timely manner, doesnt respond to student questions online, never made assignments available in time for when we were to do them. Complete lack of attention from professor. Do not recommend.",0
"His lectures are confusing if you are new to this (non-EE student here) and are full of jargon. Says that ""it's not a programming class"", but you definitely need some coding experience. Go in during his office hours, he is much more helpful and also very friendly. Gave us the option to skip the final (he'd take an average of the first two tests).",1
"She is somewhat caring but her accent makes it hard to understand what she is saying. She is always all over the place and not organized. She is unfair, some students used notes on a test and she didn't saying anything but my group did and she got upset. There are only quizzes and exams very hard to get an A.",0
all lecture from PowerPoint which is from the book boring class all you do is take notes no taking to people next to you for help.  Review below me is on point about his grading  For me the test were hard his review did not help different from test. Bad eyesight people he writes small and bright color seat on first row. you learn one python script,0
thumbs up,1
It's clear that professor Abdulkarim enjoys teaching Arabic and all students love him. I highly recommend him. What's important for Abdulkarim is to attend classes regularly and do your homework assignments on time.,1
"He keeps the lectures entertaining. Can't really say to much about his grading-- he uses TAs. Ended up with a C+ in the class, but I hate Shakespeare. So, don't take if you're not even remotely interested in the subject.",0
Glen is the man!! You don't get much better than Glen.,1
"She's a very good professor. Very passionate about the subject. Her lectures go very in depth because she fully explains every formula, theory, etc. Even when the students only need to know how to plug the numbers into the formula. HW can be frusturating because the website looks and runs like an early 2000s site.",1

"This is a case of a guy that thinks he is good and that he knows stuff. Yet, once you finish your degree you realize that he was one of these profs that have done very little in their academic life and they just put up a big act. Pathetic!",0
"Easy to take notes with the way he teaches, hes very clear. Just graded on homework, (and you can easily get 100% on each homework assignment) we only had 4 tests, and multiple opportunities for extra credit! The only thing I wish I could change is being able to use notes for the tests but otherwise overall good experience with this professor!",1
My class with Professor Dattolo was an amazing experience! Not only is he a very intelligent professor but his # 1 goal is to have his students succeed and he will go out of his way to help us do that. His lectures are clear and interesting and he always teats us with kindness and respect. He goes HIGHLY recommended!,1
"This was a condensed course, so the material was very heavy and full of irrelevant articles. The quiz questions  ranged  from confusing to obscure,  and even though I studied, I still scrambled to figure out what the profs were referring to.I don't recommend taking this class if you struggle separating pertinent material from LOADS of useless info.",0
This class is an incredible amount of work for what it should be with not a lot of notice in between assignments. Mandatory attendance and participation and on top of that the professor is a little bit harsh so it doesn't make for a comfortable leaning environment. You don't learn any valuable programs or anything the work is all busy work.,0
"Marvyn is great, he really cares about his students success and will go above and beyond to help you. I thought I hated math until I took his course! He tries his best to relate concepts to everyday life which really helps.",1
"You will not find a more dedicated professor at CSCC.  Professor Logue is kind, compassionate, and enthusiastic. Responds to emails quickly and is very active in the course. Gives great feedback and is very fair in grading. Concepts can be difficult at times, but she gives you everything you need to be successful. Highly recommend!",1
Awesome. Extremely approachable. Super clear standards. Grades are not negotiable? Very fair normal class. What more could you want?,1
This class was very boring but it is an easy A. There are a few quizzes and three tests so it is not too bad. I did not use the book that was needed and I am doing just fine. Take this class if you need it as a LASC,1
"Matt is my favorite teacher at NAU! You could ask him the same question a million times and he will always be patient and kind with you. If you have you have the chance to take his class, please take him!",1
"Professeur très compétent, tjrs dispo pour éclairer ses étudiants. C'est vrai que ses powerpoints ne sont pas très bien construits et que son ton de voix est assez monotone, mais il n'est pas un animateur tv et ses pp sont là pour aider à étudier, pas pour remplacer les notes perso. ARA1001, ARA1002, ARA2001, POL2840 : je le trouve vraiment bon.",1
i previously had assumed that professors needed some degree of intelligence. khalsa taught me never to assume anything.,0
"It was an interesting class that covered interesting topics. Gildenhuys is a little hard to follow at times, but has interesting ideas as well. Definitely must stay up on the readings, and although most people didn't attend the second class of the week, you definitely should.",0
Not helpful at all goes through problems easist way possible not good poor way if teaching would not take again,0
"TERRIBLE!! Makes a ton of mistakes. Always looks at her notes. Can't answer a question not in her notes. Didn't finish much of the laplace section. All homework online (waste of time and money). If you can take someone else, you might actually learn something. If you take her, you'll pass, but not learn anything",0
Nice guy - but he knows nothing asbout MIS - this is not a computer science class - it should be about business.,0
"Great guy! Makes class interesting, tests are usually pretty easy and he is funny.",1
If he likes you you'll do ok. No clue how things really work in business but he spent all his time in the navy.,0
"He was an overall ok prof. His classes are basically him reading his slides and explaining a bit on its content (good examples). As the semester progressed, lectures were kind dull to go to b/c they got uninteresting. Aplia assignments and 4 quizzes are fine, but the final was difficult b/c it had nothing to due with previous class assignments.",1
"The final was ridiculously hard for this class. None of the type of problems on the exam were ever given to the students as homework, practice, or web problems. It's almost like he needed to lower the average grade of the class.",0
"The most amazing teacher you will ever have. She truly cares about her students and does anything in her power to help whether it be academics, issues at home, or just anything you need. Makes class so fun by getting everyone involved. Took her for a 3 hour Winter class. it flew by and I miss it so much! Beautiful soul and mind. you learn so much",1
"Best french class ever, you'll learn a lot.",1
She don't teach,0
"class is a joke, he gets side tracked on everthing but attendance is graded. Tests are easy, and he grades even easier. extra credit available on all homework and quiz points are also extra. you wont have to work hard but you wont learn anything either....overall waste of time and money",0
"He's just awesome.. He makes lectures interesting to listen, and he has a lot of flexibilty on grading if he knows student is trying.",1
"If you do the readings and write the essays, you will likely do well, but not because of his teaching. He is often unprepared and goes on inconsequential and (often weirdly sexual) tangents that will not help you decipher the texts at all. You learn much more in discussion than class. Calls every female student ""dear"". Wouldn't recommend taking.",0
I can't believe she even got a 2. She is a really bad teacher.,0
"Day 1 I was certain I made a mistake when my guidance counselor signed me up for his course. Over time he did grow on me, has a way to keep lectures decently interesting. Tests cover a lot of info, but I never had a problem with them. Very strict guy though, especially about lateness and absences. Overall not too bad. Not a ""friend"" type of prof",1
she is unclear and always expect you do things at last minute notice like it is impossible for someone to make a good grade in her class,0
"If I was told I was allowed to slap one person without consequences, it would be this damn woman. Her class is boring, she doesn't teach, and she doesn't care about her students at all.",0
Terrible choice. All she does is read off the slides and is not willing to help the students when they have questions. She even gets annoyed when you ask questions. She thinks she is funny,0
"He rarely lectured, if he did he rushed thru the material and most likely, his lecture had NOTHING to do with exams. You are expected to read and teach yourself-- however, good luck trying to decide what obscure questions he will ask on exams. Worst prof.",0
O chem isn't the most interesting subject out there. Nor is it one of the easiest. Dr. Kennedy tries to make the course interesting (as best as the material allows him) and is always willing to help out. He even started a weekly study session outside of class. Be prepared to study A LOT.  Ask questions. Your grade at the end reflects your effort.,1
"He moved very slowly through the material and it could be dull at times. Going to class is optional however, half way through the semester, all students who were in class got a 2% bonus in their final grade.",0
"best class so far at keuka, make sure to work on the papers!!",1
Professor López is one of the best professors ive taken. Everything in the syllabus is clear. She gives amazing lectures and makes the class fun. Shes also a great person to talk to if you need help.,1
"Dr. Judson is such a nice teacher. Her class consisted of a presentation (super easy ppt you make), quizes that were only 10points that were on the readings she assigned the week prior, and then 2 tests with an optional final. She offers 10pts EC at the end. It was hard to get anything but an A in her class. TAKE HER if you want an A!",1
"Ning is confusing and skips around from one topic to the next without continuity. He doesn't explain concepts in physics, just teaches equations. You'll be lucky if he understands your questions or even acknowledges that you have a question. The class is an easy A though-all in-class worksheets and one out of three tests dropped.",0
I took Eng. 101 and 102 with Dr. Ferriera and she is the BEST! She is very caring and wants you to succeed. She's easy going and funny. She is not tough at all but you should participate in class and do the work she assigns. You also do group work which is great. Amazing lectures!. I got an A in both classes. EASY CLASS!,1
Hard but really informed professor.,1
"Knows his stuff, but is a very poor lecturer for intro. Takes a very long time to say very little.  The bulk of his slides are of very little value and does not explain complicated concepts very well.",0
Louis Nelson = AMAZING!!!! I could not have asked for better!,1
"She was a great teacher. Very well prepared for each class, and even used problems from homework on the tests. All she asked was that you try and she will help you along the way. Great teacher, I do recommend taking her!",1
Film studies class with lots of comparison papers. The movies were pretty bad (because they were old- like 1800's old). Newer movies were good. Had to watch a lot of boring/cheesy movies outside of class. Quizzes were over some film techniques covered in the textbook.,1
I recommend taking lower biology classes then go into BIO-168. Eric expects you to know biology like it is the back of your hand. He rushes his lectures.,0
She was an amazing French prof. I learned a ton with her and she is extremely nice and caring. Grade is reflective of effort as her tests are very fair and she wants everyone to do well.,1
"Though he's knowledgeable in his field, he's definitely the worst teacher I've ever had...",0
"Lectures lack organization and structure as shown with numerous breaks. Unprofessional behavior, hostility and contention towards students masked in humor. Fosters a toxic academic environment where students cant openly discuss /share clinical experiences with broader class without fear of reprisal. Lacks enthusiasm and patience for teaching.",0
She was always willing to assist and acted with a  sense of urgency on behalf of all of her students. She was always on time and worked well with us as students regarding deadlines (I took her intro to language/linguistics fall session two). Most people work full time and attend school and maintain a family and she was respectful in every aspect.,1
"To help everyone out DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!! I went into Farmingdale to get amazing grades and he made my GPA so much lower. He talks very low , when sitting in the back you can barely hear him. The Exams are VERY heavy so if you want to do good make sure you read everything he posts on blackboard. Like I said DO NOT TAKE HIM.",0
I took her online class. They layout was very unorganized and confusing. the dates are wrong in the weekly assignment folder so I got a few zeros cause she never changed the dates from her previous classes. ALOT of reading. expects you to know everything already and if you dont expects you to learn it on your own. if never taken anat before dont,0
"She knows her stuff, but the level of work required in this class is overwhelming. This was a 2 credit ELI online class, and I had alot of trouble balancing this class with my other classes. Be prepared to read the chapters. The exams are difficult as well, so follow the study guide she gives. Also, do not buy the Brief edition of the textbook.",1
hate this class! test are hard. studying is a MUST with lots of outside help. doesnt give out OLD powerpoints. Rambles.,0
For those who dont know John Street is actually the ex Mayor of Philadelphia so you will get more of a background of what it is like working in local government because of him. This was only a GenEd course but I thought he was very funny and extremely helpful. However the simulations got old real quick ��,1
Best English teacher Ive ever had! She is so sweet and will make your English experience soooo much better!!! 100/10 would recommend her. As long as you participate and put in a little effort your going to get a good grade! The discussions in her class make it very interesting and mind opening!,1
I loved taking her class and regret that I didn't take one of hers sooner. She's one of the better teachers I've had and she's willing to help on her papers and the final and gives the option of rewrites at the end of the semester. She makes the class fun and relates it to topics that might come up in the media as well. ,1
There is 1 test (the midterm) and 1 project for the entire yearbut its a group project. The project turned out to be a 50+ page document between 4 people. He said that he was expecting around 100 pages. I did a majority of the project and made sure he knew that. I walked away with a B- and my group members who did nothing all got C+'s. DO NOT TAKE,0
She made me want to drop out of college and move to another country.,0
"Professor Bledsoe was really great as a teacher. He always made class fun and interesting, and he had a great sense of humor. I was in a larger class so we unfortunately didn't get a ton of personal feedback or one-on-one time, but he still managed to be helpful and really get the material through. Doesn't hurt that's he's easy on the eyes.",1
"This guy is great, I dont know what all these other people are talking about. He is really nice and friendly. He is also a really easy grader on most things. Go to his office just to day hi and dont listen to these people because they are all WRONG. It is because of him that I am an accounting major",1
"If you want an A you have to live and breath French. Always push the limits of the language during class and with the tutor. Remember all those little finicky rules you dont think youll need (but you totally will). She want everyone to know the exact right way to use french, so remember the rules. Also, learn all the vocab before you useitinclass",1
This was by far the worst class I have taken Its her way or the highway Super tough grader she has a certain way she wants you to do everything She uses weird formulas that are hard to find outside of class if you try doing a problem with the book it uses a different formula If you dont use the specific formula she wants she docks points for it,0
"O'Donnell is overly strict and unrealistic in her expectations for her students. Her way or no way. She's rude and uninviting. Public speaking is a fearful thing for most people, and she does not make it easy to overcome this fear. Go to class and do your work ON TIME. I will never take a class with O'Donnell again.",0
Maril taught the honors version for SOCI2110 and he was very demeaning. It felt like a true lecture versus discussion and we just had to swallow and accept his ideas. He said his notes were based on facts but he picked which facts he used and omitted others. Very harsh grader and told me I didn't care about my grades when I went to his office hours,0
"never on time, sometime strays off into a rant.  easy to get along with, helpful, lets you express your thoughts, caring, knows his stuff.  not like any other professor i've had, cool dude.",1
"Do not take a class with her. She made me hate math. She does not teach and expects you to teach yourself. She is a real stickler with grading, does not matter if you get the answer right if you don't show enough work. There really is no need to make a student's life miserable. Her notes are not useful and gives a lot of homework. She is baddddd.",0
This class material is hard to grasp BUT  Michelle makes it easy. I wouldn't take this class with anyone else.,1
she's the worse,0
"Pas assez interactif. Très linéaire. Il me semble très passionné et crédible, il a également un bon vocabulaire mais n'est pas capable de nous faire participer et s'intéresser a la matière. J'ai l'impression d’assister a une messe...",0
"Professor Brown is amazing!! The workload is heavy but his lectures are so informative & you can really tell he knows his stuff, so even though there's a lot, I respect it. He's been really forgiving about grading during COVID. He even made us an all-black artist playlist in honor of BLM. I'd recommend him to anyone. You'll learn a lot from him.",1
"I heard good things before, but she was AWEFUL! Rushes thru lectures, not prepared& just tells you what 2 teach yourself. Gave wrong date for the final, some people had to take the final 2 days early, but she only gave the study guide 48 hrs before we took it. Tried 2 ask for help & she told me 2 wait for study guide. Easy B but not a good teacher",0
"There are no words to describe how good this professor is. I believe he is one of the very best! He turned my hatred for math to loving math because of his teachings. He makes sure you get it in a gentle way that is not forceful nor demeaning. ECC is not doing him justice by not placing him on full time. ECC needs more Professors like him, period!",1
"Horrible class, I could write a monologue about how the homework was excessive or how the lectures were unclear or maybe about his inability to work with me, but I'll save you the trouble of reading all of that, and of taking this class.",0
"Extremely hard grader, funny, nice, and charming, but will not let you off easily on grading.",1
"I really wanted to enjoy this class because of the subject, but Professor Sewell makes it hard to. I've taken more academically rigorous classes, yet this professor has the harshest standards of grading I've witnessed so far. She does give instructions, but even when you try to adhere to her standards, it's not good enough. Regret signing up.",0
"It's evident from her teaching that she's not the BEST professor, but certainly you could do worse. She's known by students to be very rude and generally unavailable. Honestly, if you take this class with her you'll pass and getting an A isn't difficult, but if you can avoid it...",0
"She is a waste of space.  Totally useless, living in the 80's.  This class, on the whole, is a waste of time and just a way for SCC to get money.  She thinks she is funny, she is not.  She claims you need the book, you do not.  She likes to be the grammar and spelling police when most of her work is laden with errors. The class is a complete waste.",0
No Comments,1
I missed class due to medical issues and had the papers she did not want to help me catch up and asked me to withdraw so i wouldn't fail,0
"Not good in teaching. Book won't help much, you will have study from the lecture. If you get average or above average in the exams you will be fine. This guy doesn't care about students. but he curves at the end.",0
"Many people give this teacher good reviews only because of her positive attitude and cool humor which i can agree on, but do not let her positive attitude fool you she is really tough when it comes to grading her tests are up to 50% and everything else is below 10. So trying to bring the grade up was extremely hard!!! Would not take again",0
Dr. Brown is my favorite professor. Tests are hard but he is a great guy and very approachable.,1
"She is one of those teachers that has a very specific group of people that are her little ""stars"" and who are so great in her eyes that she does not give the other more quiet students a chance. At the beginning of class she says ""Alright, so what's going on?"" and the few students that talk a lot will talk to her for 30 mins and waste class time.",0
Worst professor ever. He uses slides in his lecture that are dated 1999 and do not match up with his book which the homework and test questions come from.  He is arrogant and shoots down all questions asked.  Also keeps referring to taking Econ classes which I didn't and was not required.  He does not teach this as an Introduction to Finance.,0
"Great teacher! He has a passion about History and loves teaching it. His tests are unfair, but do extra terms and essays to gain some extra points. His final project is a 10 page movie report which is easy. He's a tough grader, just make sure to study! Over all good teacher",1
"This class so so so hard.  She not help me at all.  She think she know everything but don't know nothing.  If you know everything why not help people but since you pretend you do why don't you.  God Says: The righteous care about justice for the poor, but the wicked have no such concern...",0
"She is the absolute best! I taken her history class as my first online class and I did not regret a single bit of it. Not a lot of assignments and she gives you so much time to complete them, you would be crazy not to take this class. I would be taking another class with her next semester.",1
"She one time deducted 30 points from my friend's grade because he was staring off into space during one of our 75 billion guest speakers, and he tried to explain to her he has ADHD and Aspergers and she said he would have to make up his grade with other assignments at a later date.",0
This class is awful. He lectures for an hour straight and shows videos. The test are hard and there aren't very many of them. There is no graded homework. I do not like his lecture style or anthropology. I would avoid if you are not interest in this major. You can get a diversity requirement somewhere else.,0
He has a sense of humor which makes the lectures fun. He hands out the lecture notes and test from those so studying is way easier and organized. He doesnt jump all over the place with information and is easy to follow along with. He wants you to succeed and retain the information. I would take him again,1
"Super hard class, lots of homework, but she's a good professor. I learned a lot in her class. She can be kind of ditsy and somewhat of a pushover, but otherwise a good professor. I would take another class from her.",1
"Not good. Doesnt explain material very well, gets confused by the information himself. Doesnt do enough examples and usually stands there and points at the power point. Only uses mymathlab ppts. to teach. Tests are the majority of the grade, there's only 3. MyMathLab assignments barely count toward your grade, so if youre a bad test taker, beware.",0
"One of the worst profs I've ever had. She doesn't look at the students when she lectures or acknowledge your existence. Seems like she's reading off her slides but all she says about the artworks is that they are ""important"" because they ""changed things."" Pointless. The TA marked everything and I did really well in the course but she was awful.",0
"Even if you do the weekly 3x D2L postings, they have to be perfect or you won't get the mark. Group project is actually worse than you could imagine with no support from the prof. Impossible grader - midterm was a disaster. He's a good person, very nice, but it's almost like he wants people to regret taking an online course.",0
"omg i suffered throughout this whole class. I bought all these materials for basically nothing. She tells you to buy all these colors. You only need one of each trust me. All the hw is drawing and painting which I suck at. Beba herself is a nut but she's understanding so it evens out. Overall, I did not like this class but it was a gen ed so idk",1
"No study guides, likes to trick students on tests. No extra credit, doesn't care if you learn or not. Bad accent and hates it when you don't understand what he is saying. Do not take him!!!! Nightmare!",0
"Wish I had the experience some of these other reviewers have had, he is awful! Didnt grade a single thing until the first week of April for a class that started in January! No feedback, takes forever to respond to emails. Just does not seem like he cares at all about graduate students",0
Dr. Smith is a laid-back professor who's very informal. He seems to put more focus into socializing with his students than actually teaching them. I don't feel like I got my money's worth with this course and wouldn't recommend this guy to anyone. Assignments are fairly easy but lectures aren't engaging at ALL so plan on learning the stuff yourself,0
"Ins. Warden was very irrational when it came to grading. If you make a single mistake on one of your sources, you instantly drop to a 60 and then she grades it from there. Her assignments are very vague and she is very close minded to things she does not understand. Still made an A, but would not wish this class on anyone.",0
"Noris is a nice guy, knowledgeable, and makes Human Physiology very interesting. He is addictive, I actually looked forward to every class. The class covers a wide array of topics in physiology. Quizzes every Tuesday and he tells you whats on the quiz, so a voice recorded is highly recommended. It is an easy class. There is one research paper.",1
Luckily the concepts were fairly easy to grasp. Just basic math problems you weren't allowed to use calculators. The tests weren't difficult but if you mess up on something she treats you like you're mentally challenged. She wasn't very understanding when I went through family issues and told me the wrong time for the final. #neveragain,0
"I love having him! He's always very chill. His assignments aren't worth a lot individually and are usually pretty straight forward, but they add up! Make sure to keep up with them. Very easy to get an excellent grade in his class. He reminds me of a teddy bear too lol but that's beyond the point. Would recommend!",1
"terrible time with this guy in LFS 250 and 350, 250 was the worst class I ever took, waste of time 4 hours gone a week just like that and the course was for a whole year, absolutely useless and nothing taught, very opinionated and we do stupid activities as if we are 5 years old, same in 350 if you value your time and brain cells don't do it",0
Great professor. Lectures are fast-paced and carry a lot of content. The exams have a written section which tends to be the most difficult. Amazing lectures and teaches economics with real-world examples and show clips. Entertainng class.,1

Dr. Hunt is a Fabulous teacher!!!! I took his class online and loved it! I never found it to be too difficult.  He truly entertains as he teaches! Loved his class and learned soooo much. -  Business Law,1
"Amazing! One of the most engaging lecturers I've ever had. Very clear, concise, and actually rather entertaining. The class is pretty intense - lots of reading and attention needs to be paid - but with a bit of effort the course is really worth it. I would recommend it to anyone.",1
"Explains content very clearly, little homework, but often lectures in tight pants with a raging semi.  So I guess take the good with the bad.",1
This was a good class and she makes it where you learn a lot. She talks a lot but it's always more conversational and interesting about the topic. She very sassy and funny but wants to see you do well. Many random quizzez once a week and be sure to read because the on the tests you write in your own words,1
" very energetic women & makes class interesting, when it comes to grading (esp papers) extremely hard.  her hand writing is worse than a doctors. She will give feedback all over papers, but its illegible.  I went to office hours and she actually turned me away because she had 2 students coming at the same time. Makes EASY quest impossible to answer",0
"Her workbooks were very clear but she taught very very fast. In the beginning, she emphasized that she welcomed questions but then seemed irritated when students asked questions. It was too embarrassing to say if you fell behind but you can keep up with the workbooks! Overall a very nice woman, but taught too quickly!",1
"he was my advisor i had him for tons of classes. incredibly nice, incredibly boring to listen to him in lecture. however he's very engaging in seminars and real life. plus he's the coolest guy in the PS department",1
"Lotssssss of reading, but Quizzes and assignments aren't too difficult",0
"He makes the class interesting by showing videos. Tests are really easy. He's a great guy, I will be taking more CJ courses with him in the future. ",1
First class with him and I'm already regretting my decision to take him. Should have read these reviews. 3 hour class and I barely understood what he said in those 3 hours. He just reads off the slides and his accent is unbearable. I would avoid. Sucks that he is the only professor teaching INFO 2315 this semester. Listen to these reviews y'all!,0
"i'm sure i would be more engaged in the class if there was a child in my life and i had a vested interest to pay attention. the class felt disorganized, crowley just took her notes and wrote them on the board. low discussion/interaction in class, so it's very easy to fall asleep in. 3 tests, 1 essay. take for reqs, not to learn c&a dev.",0
"Take him over winter or summer and you will get to use cheat sheets. On those cheat sheets put all of your hw mngr problems and step by step how to do them. Learn to use your calculator. Tests are 1/2 homework type problems MC answer and 1/2 theory MC. Its not easy, but I like finance, I got an A, most people got C's. He doesnt explain that well.",1
"Took his night class.... bad idea. All he does is talk and talk, and rants about other random stuff. Don't get me wrong he is funny, but that doesn't make up for other stuff. He literally has to walk up to you in order to hear what you said. STAY AWAY lol",0
"horrendous and absolutely terrible. her explanations leave you more confused than before the explanation, assignments don't make any sense at all and quizzes are very hard",0
"Very personable and explains things well. He co-taught this class with another prof (who was terrible) and under the circumstances he did the best he could to help us understand the other prof's material. Going to class is a must because I maybe opened the ""textbook"" once and he didn't have powerpoints.",1
"Prof. Bannow is not a mean guy, let me get that out of the way. However, he talks down to students because he doesn't understand that a student doesn't master a concept by seeing it once. Do not ask questions, do not miss class, basically teach yourself. He ends up giving so much extra credit the class seems pointless. Not recommended at all.",0
"He doesn't follow his syllabus and has trouble connecting with his students on an educational level. He will talk endlessly about a subject without allowing students enough hands-on experience, which inevitably bites you in the ass when the end of the semester rolls in and he realizes you've done .5/10 of his intended projects. Nice & funny though.",0
Jones has the potential to be a good teacher but lacks the passion for teaching  She expects people to learn quick and if u don't she shames you she is always just trying to beat the clock and jam as much information in each lecture as possible which I feel is not beneficial to the students quizzes every week and exams every 3 which are cumulative.,0
"Professor Kanchi is a fantastic lecturer, but that means you actually need to attend the classes. Missing a single lecture will set you back significantly. Shes a difficult grader, but Kettering has high standards anyway. Loads of these reviews are just mad at her because the material is tough and they didn't do well. She is a fantastic professor.",1
"My mother actually had alison over 20 years ago, and since then she has built up a reputation for very difficult classes. Some have said ""impossible"". I got an A, I worked very very hard, and took alot of time off to study properly. She is tough, however if you plan on going into the medical field, you better get used to it. She def prepares you.",1
"Professor Laucella was probably one of the best Freshman seminar classes Kennesaw has. She is so caring and understanding and I don't know anyone who could dislike her. You do take a quiz every day in class but she tells you exactly what chapter it is over so textbook use, YES. Its not hard at all to finish her class with an A.",1
"This is from Longridge: ""Q: Is there a way to view my Final Exam to verify which ones I answered  incorrectly?  A: Your FINAL exam is a TEST and NOT a learning experience. As such permission to review finals is NOT given."" Her reasoning is terrible. She's not giving students opportunities to learn where they went wrong; she must be right.",0
"Her class is pretty interesting especially the debates if you have a lively class. Although her homeworks are unbearably boring, long and intense. She assigns 25+ page articles and you have 2 due every week. She is still a great professor, no tests just homework and an analysis paper due at the end of the semester.",1
"Class is darn near pointless. He never worked out one single problem in class, he just throws up a sheet of paper with how to do it for 20 seconds ",0
"Dr. Leikand words his exams and quizzes in ways that do not follow the text or his lectures. I find myself constantly confused, and I have read the textbook cover to cover. This class is structured where you read half of a chapter, take a quiz, then you have lecture on what you read, after you've already taken the quiz.",0
"Marc is a very nice guy don't get me wrong, but I took him for geography and physical science. The test are mad hard and the study guides do not help. Half of the stuff on the test aren't even on the study guide.",0
"He is a great guy but he doesn't give very good instructions. He is very experienced, but I think age is beginning to affect his memory and processing.",0
"Professor Fetter is one of the worst professors I have had at Butler. He is a great person and a very enthusiastic teacher but does not efficiently provide students with the material and teaching skills necessary to do well in class. He records notes and puts them online, which are just as confusing. Do not take him or Marketing Analytics (MK 384).",0
"Brooke is great! I took her for Trig, which i was nervous for. She always wanted to make sure we understood what she was teaching. Her lectures were never boring. Her class is weighted heavily on your exams, so make sure to study. Overall, she is a really understanding and fun teacher to take.",1
"Prof. Sun is not the right choice if you are not going to really participate. You need to read the materials in advance, prepare for pop quiz and do the homework for a good understanding of the whole thing. It is easy to get A since he curved a lot. But you will get TOTALLY LOST if you are not to spend time on the course.  A cool and kind Professor",1
"Only thing I have to add to this is: she focuses more on poetry than fiction. If you are interested in poetry, take this and she'll teach you how to improve as a poet, but it is also valuable for writers. In fact, on our exam, we were tested only for the poetry readings and poetry terminology; none of the fiction.",1
"The best professor I have gotten all year. She is a little heavy in homework, but nothing that will take more than an hour or two to Oral quizzes is a big thing for her which is not too difficult and you can use your notes! These actually make you pay attention to the course material and this helped me learn a lot.",1
Avoid at all costs.,0
"She might be one of the professors that actually got me into depression. At first, I though she is nice lady, but reality hits and got me worried about my GPA. Thanks to her, I see her as someone who doesn't see her students as worthy successors but instead sees them as failed human beings or she really hated her job working there.",0
"Ben was an awesome teacher. His lectures were always funny, but you still learn. The class is not graded on many things, but if you show up and pay attention you should be fine.",1
Makes lessons funny and personable,1
This class is just plain hard. I'm not sure a different teacher would have made much of a difference. Work hard and you will do well. Don't work hard and you will likely have to drop.,0
one of the best courses that I took.,1
"His lectures and notes aren't clear on what you are learning and what it applies to. Wasn't good at explaining things. However, go to the super tutorials and you will pass this course. You just might not learn anything.",0
worst teacher ever. went to see her for help in office and did not help what so ever. gave me the lowest grades on papers when i worked for hours on them. book readings mandatory. talks to much of herself and does not clarify well. do not recommend.,0
Mike's feedback and grading criteria are unclear and subjective. Everything we read was gratuitously sexual and/or violent. The content of the class was honestly disturbing. Mike is not tolerant of the opinions of his students and is downright condescending and rude. My high school English classes were infinitely better.,0
"I hated this class so much, I withdrew. I have never withdrawn from a class before. He did the same thing every class- talked in his boring, single paced voice from start to finish. I took notes all class, every class. I would read the chapters and go over by notes and still fail. He was a tough grader & very specific about ONE PAGE papers.",0
Not a very helpful professor... but not horrible. There certainly are worse professors. I feel neutral or indifferent toward the class and professor.,0
He is an amazing teacher and his class is an easy A if you keep up and do the work,1
"Really personable, really interesting, really good guy. If you can't take classics classes with him, at least do your cultural heritage with him. It's a really great time. Discussions are lively and relevant, and the class is really engaging.",1
"Professor Berger-Hill truly loves teaching and seeing her students succeed! If you truly love sociology and want to learn a lot, she is for you. While she does give a good amount of work, it is always clear how and why it will help you better understand everything. Plus, I've been told her recommendations are magic! So, look no further.",1
Professor Aragona executes her lessons in the most organized and straight to the point ways.. She's an amazing professor who offers her assistance and makes contacting her very easy.. I've taken several classes with her and strongly recommended her as a professor!!,1
"I have never had a problem with math or any other professor, I am a mech. engineering major and needed this course. 40+ hw problems a night, study guides for exams have no relevance. Can't explain himself or the subject due to his lack of knowledge of the English language. Class started w/ 23 students, its down to 7. Please, avoid him at all costs.",0
"PROS: EVERYTHING is on canvas, so you never have to guess what will be on the tests. He is really lenient when he grades the test and lab practicals. He gives you extra credit opportunities. Questions are welcomed. CONS: This summer course is a 4 hour class MTWR, his accent was a little hard to understand. The class requires a lot out of you.",1
"Great class, nothing else like it out there.  Takes some work to keep up in lectures.  Uses Greek a lot.",1
"Rude and unhelpful. After I did poorly on the first test, I asked for help with coursework and all he said was ""so are you going to drop the class or not.?"" Obviously  I should've as I failed the course and had to change majors anyways.",0
"Gives tons of reading and writing, oblivious to your time. Thinks his class is the only thing you do with your life. Boring lecture, very repetitive, monotone voice. Grades and does not explain why you got a grade",0
Amazing teacher! Very caring.,1
"Her teaching style is for you to learn the material yourself, on your own. She is very disorganized. She drops tons of paperwork on you at the last minute. This semester, over half her class is failing the department wide tests. A ticket to her class is a ticket to failure. Go with another prof; don't waste your time with her.",0
"Absolutely loved her!! I highly recommend her classes! I took the six week summer course which is a lot of work at once, but once it's over, it's over.  Quizzes every day, but they are very helpful for the tests, and not all are counted.",1
"she's really easy going, fun teacher, nice class. her marking is lenient too. go for it!",1
Professor Reyes is really funny and he makes Spanish fun. You still have to study hard to get a good grade. Overall the class was good.,1
"What a sweet person. Maria is one of the few professors that makes video lectures and feedback and posts them. I found that so so helpful. She is super nice and really accessible, knowledgeable, and understanding. I learned so much in her class that I will need to finish college. She is not too as a grader and listens to feedback.",1
She is a really caring and wonderful professor. Her class was really easy but just a bit boring. She does have an accent but it's not that bad. She will gladly help any students or clarify.,1
"worst teacher ever.. dont take her.. you'll regret it.. she's mean, bitter and wont ever help you..",0
"Mr. Odien is a very good professor with a distinct drive and passion for what he does. His well-presented lectures are important to your success in the class and his personality makes everything interesting. He is always available to help, even during tests. That being, if you're looking for an easy class or dislike geology, I wouldn't take him.",1
He is very patient and helpful.   He explains everything until you understand it.  I learned a lot in his class.,1
I would NOT recommend taking his class. Maybe the first two days of class is good only. If you make it to class 4 minutes late you won't be able to get in. Which he has just arrived 2 minutes late. Tough grader. Doesn't give feedback on essays. Expects you to know your errors. No enthusiasm. Lectures feel like you'd rather be somewhere else.,0
"Although he might know what he's talking about, the thing is when he rambles and goes too fast, it's extremely hard to follow!!! Also, his writing onthe board was so hard to read, I barely took notes. So, if there was another teacher to take, I would say take em'. But your SCREWED, cuz he's the only teacher!!! overall, I absolutly HATED this class!",0
Honestly I think I would rather watch paint dry then listen to this profs lectures. Workload heavy even though it is a required course and half the students do not want to be there.,0
"Allen is a cool guy, lectures really boring though he just talks the whole time hoping somebody will ask a question. Gives a few exams that are blue book style but pretty clear and fair. Assigns four books but I doubt anybody reads them he explains them in class. Decent class for a GenEd easy A.",1
"AMAZING instructor. Mrs. McGee is the absolute best biology instructor on campus. You will do a lot of reading and assignments along with quizzes and exams, but it is all worth it. You have no choice but to learn in her class because you can't slack your way through. She is hilarious, adorable, and makes biology fun!",1
"If monotones and boring lectures aren't your cup of tea I wouldn't recommend this professor. He is nice and his classes are interesting but the 3 hours of lecture are hard to stay awake in. Attendance is a must, and there are 2 roll sheets so you can't skip, homework is easy otherwise just be prepared to feel like you're in high school again.",1
"awesome class, awesome teacher",1
Professor Nielsen was very kind and sweet every single day in class. The one thing that I would criticize is the somewhat difficult to understand criteria for submissions and projects- a lot of the directions are difficult to understand and the portfolio submission process was very confusing because of the confusing directions she gave us.,1
"Prof. Wood's nice person & knows lots about math; BUT, she expects you to know as much about math as she does. She grades EXTREMELY HEAVILY on tests & quizzes. One skipped step in factoring & your grade will suffer. She'll mark your answer wrong if you use a different method to get the same answer. Good luck on trying to pass this class :/",0
"Easy material, however, she makes sure that if she doesnt like you that you will not pass.  Cannot pass class if you miss ANY homework assignments.",1
"Very fun teacher, hard to understand sometimes. Show up to class, do the projects and you will automatically get 100%. Book is used for very simple online quizzes. Gives you lecture notes, but goes over the exam before you take it. Very smart, fun, professor I highly recommend taking",1
"Honestly, if you procastinate I recommend you not take this class because he is a tough grader! He doesn't care for excuses he will give you the grade he thinks you deserve. If you show up everyday, pay attention, and take very good notes then you'll most likely pass but very few people pass",0
"Class isn't too hard, but its definitely not easy either, and you still learn a lot",1
"Great intro class.  Prof. Watts is engaging and genuinely interested in helping each student become a better writer.  As is the case with most professors, if you make it to classes and make an effort to communicate with her, you will learn a good deal and have the grades to show for it.",1
If yoy take her class. You better lean on my math lab and be good at teaching yourself because she does not lecture and not good lectures when she does.,0
You really should take lab with this guy! One of the funniest professors I've ever had. Half the time you don't even do the lab and he grades you on TAKE HOME tests! You rarely stay over an hour and a half!,1
"Professors dont matter that much with organic chem II. Good or bad the class is still gonna be one of the hardest youve ever taken. Accept that. But MS is one of the best professors if not. Always has a hilarious story, makes lecture fun. Material is hard, exams are fair and professor is amazing. Take MS above all other orgo professors.",1
"her expectations are pretty high. all the tests are culmuative recaps of the readings and lectures, so pay attention.",1
He is not clear the way he teaches and makes you feel very dumb.,0
"I had a hard time learning from Logan b/c he sped through the lectures. He gave out practice tests before each test which was a lot easier than the actual test. The final was super easy which helped push my B up to an A. He is super quiet and boring, was very hard to sit through his class.",0
"One of the best professors I have had. You do have 1 presentation of 10 minutes but she is by no means a hard grader. The best part is that she tells you exactly what powerpoints to study for the 3 exams you have and better yet the final is a cumulative of the 3 exams, its a given to pass. Also allows for make up work and labs to be done in groups.",1
Prof Regan is the definition of teaches by the book. Homework and classwork assignments are direct readings from the book. He speaks very clear which makes him easy to understand. He also calls on random people during review to get see who does and doesn't understand the work. Test are not overly difficult but require practice(HW and CW) to pass.,1
Super vague about all assignments then incredibly rude when no one in the class understands what she is asking for. Horrible professor don't take.,0
"Arts and crafts for babies was the most difficult course I have taken at MacEwan university. I took Gerard's class becasue I heard he was inspirational and it would be a GPA boost, but instead I just found myself up at 2am gluing googly eyes into a scrapbook in order to explain my life story to my classmates in picture format the next day.",0
"Every time I emailed her, she would take forever and then answer with not helpful information. Literally reads over the power-points and doesnt explain much. Youre pretty much on your own unless you study with a group.",0
"Do yourself a favor and STEER CLEAR of this course/professor. She has terrible rapport with students. Unpredictable, unkind. And this coming from someone who did well in her class.",0
"Dr. Kuss would be a great teacher if he could actually teach. He is a very intelligent man but he paces back and forth while lecturing, he mumbles everything, and he never looks his students in the eye. Worst lectures I have ever been through. You will need the book just to teach yourself all the material.",0
"Honestly, one of the worst experiences Ive had with a professor in general. As a person, hes a good guy but when it comes to teaching the class and grading not so much. Very specific on his grading and will deduct points for missing a lim or parenthesis or something minor. No study guides. Gives hardest version of questions on test.",0
Very helpful if you put in the effort,1
"Most caring, sweetest, funny, and amazing professor Ive ever had in all my years of school. Had her for an online class during the pandemic and she was adjusting just like we had too. She extended due dates and you tell her when you can submit something even after the deadline. PowerPoints and lectures were fun to watch, very short quizzes!",1
"If you just take notes during his lectures, and follow the objectives in the syllabus, you are pretty much guaranteed an A in the course.",1
She was the best Biology teacher I have ever had. She had a way of really making things clear and interesting.,1
A real gem of a professor. His class was my favorite Gen Ed/Hub Unit so far. A great class if you have decent Bible Knowledge and would like to supplement it.,1
"Gets uncomfortable if you have different political views than him, which he voices very clearly. Lots of difficult reading. Main journal assignment is difficult because he wants it done before class which is before he actually teaches anything. Absolutely no feedback and grades wildly different each time. Yells a lot. Did learn a little though",0
"Good instructor. Very thorough grader but always on point in class.  He provides lots a very detailed feedback and the course is well organized. Dont get me wrong, its a lot of work, but I learned something. Follow directions, read and ask for help if you need it. Stagg was always willing to help anytime I asked.",1
"This was a good class& teacher but she had that tough,scary act at times that made you want to do all your work. She was pretty helpful but it was also pulling teeth when it came to written assignments. She always said something needed to be change, nothing was ever perfect. & she said she never gave extra credit which i thought was kinda wrong.",1
Would definitely take her for another English class.,1
"Expects a lot, but a truly knowledgable and inspiring teacher. Wants all of her students to do well, but you have to work hard. ",1
He just talks on and one and on an on. Show up and stay awake and you will pass . It is an easy class just boring.,0
"He is probably the easiest professor! I had him twice a week. In the first 3 weeks, he cancelled class 4 times! Now, as the semester is ending, class has been canceled 7 times already. His work is very simple, you read at home, review the reading in class, and then write a 4-6page essay on your view of the topic. NO TESTS/QUIZZES AT ALL!",1
"Jane is by far the best professor I've ever had! She has an amazing personality, and she will have you cracking up the entire class. Her goal is to keep the class interesting and entertaining. She is a very easy grader. We had an open book exam. And the other exams we had, we got practice exams beforehand and the actual exam was near the same.",1
"DO NOT TAKE. He over complicates the simplest of concepts. We spent 30 minutes trying to solve one problem. He does not seem prepared for the ""lecture"". I put lecture in quotes because he makes you watch Kahn Academy videos instead of using class time to teach us. I would consider this an English course instead of a math one because of reflections",0
"Will confirm your figures for your essays, goes to answer the exact same question but it's a different group and he'll say that it's absolutely wrong. Doesn't know what he wants. Has said ""i dont care"" and ""do better"" when people come to him for help. 80% of his neuro class have F's. Dont take him. You've been warned.",0
"The course itself was easy and interesting, but the prof made it difficult as some of the material discussed would be completely different from the quizzes.  I enjoyed the class but not the prof who taught it.",0
"His class is super easy! Lectures are only 2 hours long. The review test are identical to the in class exams. You only need the textbook for homework, but you can take pictures of the homework at the library. Easy A. if you plan on taking higher maths I wouldn't recommend him(Math majors). If you only require one or 2 math courses, he's worth it",1
"I have had Dr. Storslee for several CIS classes, 5 to be exact, including CIS 233.  He shows up early and is always there to answer your questions.  He responds quickly to e-mails and is extremely helpful.  He makes complicated web development subjects easy to understand.  Highly recommended!",1
"Soo... Im an 4.0 student, here's my take: Pros: homework and exams (2 tries each) are easy, found on quizlet. she gives many reminders abt deadlines. Cons: even if u use quizlet, hw takes hours to complete. Four writing assignments that are 500 word, and graded harshly Going to class is pretty useless, but still mandatory. no extra cred or makeups",1
Great teacher.  Love his stories which actually help you remember the curriculum.  One of the best at ACC.,1
"Overall, he is a man that knows his stuff. His work and critiscm is by far some of the best you can get on that campus. However, his grading and expectations is sometimes over the top and ridiculous. He holds everyone at a professional expectation which is good and bad. He has no censor and says whatever he wants. Overall 3 stars.",0
"Nice professor overall, but as a student trying to do good in biology, please DO NOT take this professor. Test are all free response questions. Up to 8 chapters in one test. Almost impossible to pass. Lectures are unorganized, and she does not seem to care about helping her students succeed with the little/zero guidance she gives her students.",0
The BEST professor ever! I am not a chemistry type of person but he made me love it because his lectures were very understandable. He's a funny guy and is always there for you to reach out to. People that give him bad reviews probably got a bad grade in the class. I'm not an easy learner. Reviews are kinda like the exams and offers extra credit.,1
"I have never meet anybody like Ted Stephenson. He is truly the GOAT. Not only he is willing to help you succeed in his course. He is also willing to help students succeed in other courses as well. Any new students taking Financial Planning, Consumer Behavior, Financial Technology or Bank Financial Intermediates. I strongly recommend to take him.",1
Simply a fantastic teacher. There was no day in the class where someone was feeling unhappy and Prey brought such energy to the class that he was respected and loved by everyone in his class. He is also more than willing to help on anything that anyone had trouble understanding and even admits to anything he doesn't confidently understand himself,1
Going to Think Tank for help on her WebAssign homework is essential to passing (sometimes there will be things on there she doesn't cover in class). Her classnotes are helpful- always review materials from the unit before the test because she usually uses problems from notes. Beware of missing homework that she posts the night before it's due.,1
"Kelli is seriously one of the coolest professors at UNL. Coming from out of state especially, she was always extremely welcoming and open for help. JOMC 101 is taught in multiple different ways. We have industry exercises, lecture, videos, etc. There are so many different ways that she teaches, so no matter how you learn, everyone will understand.",1
"Such a sweet man. No homework only 3 exams, but he hands you them weeks ahead of time so you know exactly what's on them. You dont have to show up to class to pass especially if you have the textbook tho lectures, as boring as they are, do help a bit. A 10 page paper but it's super easy, just watch 3-4 movies and summarize/review them.",1
Weekly homework & 3 exams. Takes long to reply to emails. Honestly was praying for a C and ended up getting a B because everyone else did bad too and I think he was a little more lenient after the COVID situation. I would recommend taking someone else if you can. He did end up letting me redo two homeworks at the end of the semester when I asked.,0
"Smart and genuine.  Some of the material was a bit dry, but she helped make it interesting.  I would take any class from her.",1
"The class is called avoding sexual harassment.  I think there are way too much reading considering it is only a one credit class.  Plus there is a final exam which I think is unnecessary.  If you need a one credit class, take something easier.",0
"WORST teacher I have ever taken. Very rude, and super unclear. Half of the class time would be spent would be spent going completely off topic and talking about her personal experiences (interesting but NOT related to anatomy or things to help us study). Never learned anything from lecture. Tests are timed and have 5 chapters per test. DONT TAKE IT",0
Logic 1 - Really nice & funny guy but class was awful. He isn't very good at teaching but he tries his best to explain things to you BUT ALWAYS digresses. No quizzes. Exams have no study guides or sheets. The book is ancient and the language makes it impossible to understand. Not an easy class so unless it's ur major don't take it.,1
I dont recommend taking him online!! The semester is over in 1 week and I dont have grades for any of my paper projects and one of the tests that was taken on campus. He doesnt really respond to emails. Its a pretty easy class he just doesnt post grades so you dont know how you are doing in his class..,0
"Nakaji is a wonderful professor. She is helpful to the student and gives special notice to those that are putting in the work. She interjects fun and enthusiasm to her teaching method. When it come to helping students she will not hesitate to pause or slow down to be sure you, and your classmates understand the material. Great intro to ASL",1
"From experience, I highly suggest taking someone else. Eileen is very rude and humiliating to her students in class. It's happened various times during the term I took it. She doesn't know what she's doing half the time and she doesn't help you, she insults you when you don't know something. Shame MDC doesn't have another Opera Works. professor.",0
She is an easy teacher but argues points that are no longer truse since she hasn't been in a classroom for years.,0
"She assigns work daily to turn in the next class. She does not accept late work, nor does she grade on time. If you want to go the semester not knowing your grade by her or BB she's the one. This is a SELF LEARN COURSE!!!!! Only took the class because it was substitution for Stats II. Should have took my chances with Stats.",0
"Professor Ladon has a lot of knowledge about what she teaches but she teaches the 121 class as if it is a 131 or higher level course. She is belittling when students ask questions and expects students to do numerous hours of studying, whether it be from the textbook or practice problems. She drops the lowest quiz and homework grade.",0
"Worst teacher, why am I even calling him a teacher. EVERYONE failed EVERY test, highest test avg for class was a 52, with a 20 point curve. ",0
"He is an amazing Prof. Fun, Energetic Helpful, Enthusiastic.. If I find he teaches something else I am definetly going to take it!!! I would recommdend this prof. to anyone. He will help you one on one if you need to. His theme for the class this year was violence! It is my most interesting class!!",1
"Falcon has a huge fan club, but he's simply not a good teacher. If you sign up for his class, read the syllabus and you will see what I mean. Frustratingly obtuse man with no problem being ""tough"" (but not really tough, just irrespobsible)",0
"Easy Homework. Lengthy Tests. Classes are SO much fun, he is always joking around. Cancels class often and/or lets out very early. DEFINATELY take for Computer Science 201!",1
"not sure why Professor Tavvs gets great reviews for his lectures.  He is a very sweet guy but his lectures were not for me.  If you see on his syllabus, his notes are very in depth with a lot of problems that are not necessary  (70+ pages).  Tavss does put in a lot of effort and do his practice probs! I Prefer Guerra or Kimmel.",0
"The reading material this professor requires is outrageous. There was no textbook for my course by he posted 10 or more articles a day that he expected the students to read. Some articles were as little as 5-10 pages but many were 20 pages+. If you have the option to take another professor, I encourage it!",1
"Luttrell is a nice guy. He's willing to help you if you have already looked in the most obvious places for answers, so don't waste his time asking a question if you haven't even tried to find an answer yourself. I really liked the course load, i feel it was fair and informative. definitely not an airhead like most professors, would take again.",1
This was the most interesting class I have had so far! He is a great prof. and is funny!,1
Great Teacher!,1
"Not my favourite prof, found him very hard to follow and almost always getting off track. It was almost impossible for me to define or understand the meaning of many of the key terms to the point where i would rather sit at home and read the text book than attend his lectures.",0
Thankfully tests are open book. All of class is spent reading power points. We work in groups in a lot for participation grades. She does count points off if you are absent.,0
"One of the worst professors I've had. Nothing she talks about in class is on the tests so if you don't memorize the text book, you won't do good on the test. All she talks about is sex because apparently she is a ""sex anthropologist"" -which would be funny if she didn't make the class so hard.",0
"I took this online, and it was probably the easiest class I have ever taken, BUT do every study guide for each test which requires you to read the book to find the answers. The study guide is usually 100 questions and the test is composed of 50 of those 100 questions. Tip: highlight the answers in Word, then when it's time for the test, ""ctrl + f"".",1
"The worst teacher I have ever had from elementary school to college. I took his astronomy course as a visiting student a few summers ago. I go to a college that is ranked top 30 in the country and was expecting to do well in this course. Not only was he an awful teacher, he made you feel stupid for asking questions and if you dont understand.",0
"Dr Hanson is a very respectable and knowledgeable instructor. He pushes you to work hard but is helpful and reasonable about grading. If you take the class seriously, there's nothing to worry about.",1
"good prof. watch his lectures read the textbook and youll pass, quizes are shortly times so you will have to work fast!! the rest was pretty solid .",1
"She is boring. Students talk while she is lecturing and she can't control her class. She is a great person, just not teacher material. She is not punctual. We don't get started until like 40 minutes into the class period. I really like her as a person and she is a great social worker!",0
prof. goldner is very unorganized during lectures. good luck taking notes because he jumps around from topic to topic without making anything cohesive. his study guides are useless as nothing listed on them correlate to the exams. he's very rude and patronizing to his students and his classroom etiquette is ridiculous. history majors avoid him.,0
"Reading the reviews made me wary, however after going to lecture and doing the first midterm, I'd say all the 1.0/5 ratings are from salty students who don't study. This prof is awesome, yeah she speaks softly during lecture, just pay better attention! She has immense knowledge in archaeology and you will do well if you study hard! Highly recommend",1
Mr. Martin is an understanding guy and really cares for his students and their success! This course isn't hard and should be taken serious. ,1
most likely the most fun class i have. the core of the course revolves around class discussion and walking through topics. has true real world experience. learning takes precident over opinions and theres no punishment for being wrong. everyones thought matters. tests are ethics based and open book. amazing professor,1
He's the only professor at coc that has said bring all your questions and concerns to me. He does have a strong accent but knows exactly what he's talking about if you listen!! You learn from him just by watching what he does. He'll stay hours after class helping students in anyway possible. One of the nicest most genuine professors I ever had.,1
"How to get an ""A"" in KNES 350 with Jo Zimmerman: 1)Show up to class EVERY DAY and take the clicker quiz.  2)Put at least some effort into the paper (everyone gets an ""A"" if you follow instructions).  3)Study the and memorize the highlighted slides before each test.  Yes the class is boring but it's an easy ""A"" if you put some effort into it.",1
dont take her she thinks this is a history school. fuller was the best bro whatever happened to that guy,0
"I've never met a professor who absolutely refuses to answer emails before. Sure, a few might take longer than others. But to NEVER answer and then blame you for misunderstanding something? She's ridiculous.",0
"Doesn't go through examples thoroughly. Practice and practice more! The key to passing the tests is know your reactions top to bottom, backwards and forwards. I'm not joking. Half class dropped, many students in there were repeating the course for a 2nd and 3rd time with him. Reading the book helps a lot/homework. Lectures don't cover everything!",0
This Professor was probably one of the most confusing and hard to read professors I have endured. She teaches a four hour class that can easily be taught in an hour and fifteen minutes. Only use her if there is no other open class.,0
"Essay prompts are pretty ridiculous but not impossible to get done. In-class presentations do not help in any way, but she seems to think they do. Journal Entries aren't entirely difficult, just a waste of time and unnecessary. Not bad, but I would NEVER take her class again. Terrible teacher.",0
"The classes at boring all she does is read of the power point and posts it up on BB. its 3 exams, 1 final, a group projects and presentation which is 9 service learning hours, and a 5pg term paper. she offers extra credit worth 5 points. test are average not too hard, takes forever going over the chapters, behind of schedule for exams.",0
great prof!,1
"Worst professor ever. Her lecture videos are completely useless. I learned better through reading the course notes. Kept making mistakes in quizzes and penalize students for her own mistake. She has never ever admitted that she made a mistake, even when it's very obvious that the question had an incorrect solution or worded ambiguously. Avoid her!",0
"This professor is the reason I change my concentration  from Ancient Medieval to Latin American History. She is one of the most flexible and understanding role models I've ever met. As long as you participate, and do the readings you will pass the quiz's & exams  with a B+ if not an A for sure. Visit office hours show that you care, its that easy.",1
This class is impossible. The papers are are really hard.,0
The guy doesn't teach whatsoever. He tells you he's on your side but that's a load of.... Instead of teaching you the material he talks about how bad professors are nowadays when hes the worst of them all. His exams are really hard and the fact that you have to teach yourself doesn't help.,0
"He was very truthful in his syllabus. Every due date and exam date was presented at the very beginning of the semester. He was very willing to work around circumstances and very nice. He also curved every exam and had office hours for students to come by to get feedback on papers. Only thing I didn't like was his lectures, put me to sleep...",1
"If you appreciate being talked down to, being disrespected constantly, and not having your questions answered. This class is for you.",0
"The workload felt like a six credit course and I was not prepared for all the reading. You have to read the very difficult textbook to do the weekly quizzes but don't need it for the final, which is annoying. Studied an hour every day for the whole summer while working full-time and got an A so it's not impossible, it just won't be easy.",0
"Laura is an excellent teacher. She loves her job and is VERY helpful. She teaches with enthusiasm and never misses a class. Her essays, quiz's, and text are all worth it. By the end of that class you'll have learned how to clearly write arguments of all sorts and have read really important novels in relevance towards American society.",1
"Miss Pillai is very responsible and passionate about teaching. The grading is strict I do admit, but that does for the whole French department, no points were taken out of personal favor or so, the rubric was clear. But most importantly, her class is not dull at all, so personally I wouldn't even want to skip this class because it was just SO fun.",1
He is a nice guy but the class is hard and the only way to do well is listening to his lecture,0
"A very hard class. there are a lot of memorization but he allows a cheat sheet.  Even though he was hard to understand, he was very dedicated to his students. He held a lot of office hours. I would recommend to study the material asking for help because he will get angry. He counts attendance by asking clickers questions.",1
"As a person, Hoffman is the best guy out there, but as a professor he is just extremely hard. Lectures are easy to understand, but his exams are no where close to his practice problems. No extra credit, no homework points. He solely grades you on your exam grades. 6 exams in total and your grade is based on total points you receive.",0
"Dr. Falk is the nicest professor that I have dealt with, but I had a hard time learning in this class. Every day I was so confused and did not know what I was writing down. The homework dealt with topics that are not even covered until a few class periods after they are due and the exam grades are always really bad in regards to the class.",0
"He has little knowledge of economics outside what he's read in the textbook that you use in class. He ""encourages"" discussion, but anything that doesn't fit into his narrow ideology is shot down. One day in class he made the claim that, and I quote, ""libertarian ideas of economics are the same thing as socialism"". I'll let that speak for itself.",0
"Terrible teacher. Got good grades so far, but approaching him is useless for help. He's very rude to plenty of students. The class is all lecture, and for tests, he only gives you the questions. 100 questions on test, must find answers yourself. 6-8 page essay. 2 100 questions tests. Never expect to leave early. Would not take him again.",1
"Greg is my favorite prof at Highline. He isn't a prof who seems particularly invested in his students, but his appreciation for good work and good participation in class is admirable and respectable. I have taken multiple classes with him and work with him on projects even now that I'm not in class with him. Excellent prof, hilarious too.",1
Graded mainly on 3 essays. You learn nothing useful in lectures because he is too busy talking about his own life or other people's lives. You will need to read a few articles but they're all pretty pointless. He is caring and wants to be close to his students but not a great professor. You won't learn anything. Most people get Cs on essays.,0
"He's so great!! Very helpful. He gives quizzes, midterm and a final exam. But honestly if you pay attention you should be fine.",1
"When he gives criteria for essays, double every quantity and you'll get a B, guaranteed, if you ever get a grade back for it. If you can avoid him, do so. Sometimes he won't put due dates on things in canvas just so he can copy paste his format and do the least amount of work then canvas doesn't show you have anything to do. He should be fired.",0
"LA is the best professor at Carleton. She sets up the course so that students have a chance to succeed if they work hard. She has an amazing background & is helpful in every way. I would LOVE to have the chance to take another course with her, and I am signing my fiance up in her class for the fall!",1
"This woman is MEAN. I worked hard and made an A, so it can be done. Terrible experience though....",0
shes amazing and so inspiring. so damn helpful and very clear. easy A if you do the work. she doesnt want you to just study and stress you out but she wants you to actually learn so that was very helpful. I wish she taught other psc classes as well because shes an amazing professor.,1
By far without a doubt the worse professor I've ever had. She changes her grading rubric weekly. I am convinced she comes up with her own rules of the English language and grades your papers based on that. Avoid her at all costs.,0
Unclear with expectations. Expect to teach yourself most of the subject matter if it's important to your education or career. Double check HIS work...,0
Kelli has great industry experience from before she was a professor and does a great job of incorporating that into her lectures. If you show up prepared and ready to participate Kelli is a great teacher. If you just want to sit in the back and never talk it will be harder for you to get the full experience of her class.,1
"I studied every day for this course and got deducted points for saying too much. I got an 85% avg mark for the lab portion with the lab instructors marking-which is all based off short answer but could only get no higher than a 71 for his exams. Super unfair prof, hes a nice guy but I would not recommend him to anyone.",0
Great experience. Teacher was very helpful.,1
Very fun class. Easy assignments and fun lectures.,1
Professor Kim had really long and boring lectures.  He flew through powerpoint slides and didn't really explain concepts well at all.  Never actually had an in-class test until the final so I had no clue what his tests were like until then.  Just was not a good teacher when it came to teaching or testing.  Somehow got a B-.  Would not recommend. ,0
"This is one instructor that will make you laugh, smile, and cry all in the same day. His story is so amazing, everything he has been through has made him a better teacher and I have to say it was a pleasure knowing him while I had his class. When possible take one of his classes because you will not be sorry you did.",1
"She is absolutely wonderful. I enjoyed this class very much. If you don't pass this class either you just didn't try or accounting is just not at all for you. She explains things very well and has many extra credit opportunities. DO NOT USE YOUR PHONE IN HER CLASS, she hates it and its disrespectful.",1
"He is a great professor for Music class. If you won't be able to catch up easily, he will be going to repeat it again. Get ready because he will have you do a term paper, listening logs and concert reports. You can ask him to extend the deadlines for all of these. He gives a lot of extra credit points. Be sure to attend and never miss class. ",1
"Dr. Keeling tends to set a lot of homework, however, he doesn't really give meaningful feedback. Furthermore, he is pretty passive aggressive and very strict when it comes to his criteria. As long as you don't turn anything in late or walk into class late, you'll be fine.",0
"good course, timber is good too but have calculations",1
"Professor demanded perfection from students while constantly being late on his promises to the class. He pushed deadline for the final assignment 3 times, totaling two weeks and and kept failing to provide the assignment specs. In the end, he didn't even provide what he had promised and basically said ""too bad."" There were also lectures missing.",0
"A bit intimidating to speak up in class because he will question everything you say, but he seems to genuinely care too. Going to office hours helped.",1
Nobody I knew got above 60% on their tests and we all went to every class and studied before each exam.,0
No Comments,0
She''s rude. You have to beg for assistance which she will cut you off for asking. She is scatterbrained and never organized. I dread this class every day because she is just not a good teacher and she drives me insane. ,0
Great Professor. He understands that most of the students in this course aren't science majors and the course itself isn't that hard if you give a little effort. There is so much extra credit that lots of students end up with over 100%.,1
"leave, leave, leave... unless you want to have the worse semester of your university career.",0
Terrible at explaining the material. You come to class and all he does is work through examples. If you ask a question -- be prepared to look like an idiot. His tests are more difficult and somewhat different than what's on the homework he assigns.,0
"I took this class since the Holocaust is one of my main interests. The class should have been easy for me. However, she goes way too fast for anyone taking notes by hand to write anything down and doesn't like to see anything through anyone else's eyes. She has no formal grading system and is of little to no help on the one paper assignment we get.",0
Professor Woodman made lectures enjoyable which made up for the fact that she enforced attendance. She responds to emails quickly and is always very nice and helpful. All homework and quizzes are online and you can work as far ahead as you want; midterm and final were really easy.,1
Angie is the best prof at X! She is so energetic and loves being in class. One of my biggest role models ,1
"I took him for Finite after having to take math 0800 twice (failed once, passed second time) and he is truly the best math professor out there!! I wish he taught ever single subject because he is really the best. Gives study guides similar to the test. Multiple choice too! If you can take him, DO IT! YOU WONT REGRET IT!",1
Just finished a class with Ms. Magdaleno & I have to say shes my favorite teacher so far at the Art Institute. Its not just because of her ass which is nice like the other people have said; but She makes class fun & exciting I learned a lot from her about color. Its a lot of work at times & its never boring. If anything else her ass is worth it,1
"Professor Perkins lacks in the area of professionalism. I have never been so offended by an educator. She constantly berades her minority students and passes it off as having a "" unique and hands-on"" teaching style. There also have been several instances where I have feared for my personal safety under her leadership.",0
"Incredibly nice teacher with little surprises on exams.  Only questioned on topics that were discussed in class.  Study hard for exams and you'll be fine.  Super concerned with helping her students and it shows.  Lectures get boring, but still super nice and a good teacher.",1
"Very long, monotone, boring classes.",0
"she set me up for failure, did not give grades back until the drop date, if you have a different opinion than her she will fail you, my whole class is basically failing now, have to meet outside of class and graded on it, have to come up with your own exam questions and even those are not good enough for her. exams have too much for the time period",0
"By a wide margin, the least enthused professor I've ever had. It is difficult to pay attention in this class even though I love biology. No involvement from the class or anything to keep you on your toes. Just do your homework, read the chapters, show up, you'll get an A.",0
Profesor McCarthy is a very nice but I would not recommend taking her class! She is an extremely tough grader and will not give out an A. I am an A student and I got a C on my first paper. She allows you to correct your paper which is helpful. You are given 3 papers but she just expects way too much. Assignments are unclear.,0
"I did this one online, the content was nothing I hadn't studied in high school. Just a brush up course really. No homework online and you can do the exams anytime you like. I finished early so I could focus on other subjects. He was always quick back with emails but you're probably better off getting help in the LRC.",1
Judges when you don't understand... Not entirely sure if he understands to be honest.,0
"I have mixed feelings about him. Sometimes he will say a student's opinion is not correct and can easily point you out for having your phone out.. rude. Boring lectures, BUT he has nice guests come in and the movies he plays are inspirational. Tests are pretty hard but as long as you study key ideas you'll be ok. I didn't read i'm passing fine!",1
"Has a good sense of humor, great person but horrible professor. Has only three tests and are very hard. I'm already bad at math but he won't let us use the formula sheet.  Whenever I don't get something I ask but I still don't get it. Goes way too fast. If you're good at math I'd recommend his class but if you aren't I wouldn't.",0
"Professor Brownlee is a nice guy, but I regretted taking his government class in a way. The topic was very interesting and I enjoyed the lectures. However, it's hard to get an A in the class due to there being only 3 exams (30 pts) and 10 points for showing up on exam days. A difference of 3 points or a bad exam can ruin your grade. Lots to read!!!",1
He's very good with feedback and will take the time to explain himself and his expectations. I would recommend him to anyone. Really enjoyed this class.,1
"This guy is honestly awful as a professor. Just finished another exam in which no one could even manage a B. The way he words questions is terrible and unclear and he refuses to change anything or take suggestions, despite the fact that out of the entire class 15 have below a C.",0
"I took this class as a Hybrid course, half online/in person. I have to be honest, her personality is intense but if you get to know her, she's a sweet person. Just get your work done and don't miss class. Expect quizzes every week. The questions aren't hard, answers can be found directly in the textbook (even online). I recommend online.",1
"Some people were permitted late work and some weren't despite same reasons. Grading of drawings is inconsistent: a student loses 5 points for having a dimension line that is too long and another student loses 1 point for the same same line, same length. Why? I don't know. You teach yourselves, get others to help you. He does a short demo each day.",0
You'll never find another professor like this guy EVER!  In order to survive you need to enjoy it and work your ASS off.  Lower plants is extremely difficult but extremely rewarding.  Best part are the field trips.  Sample exam is the way to prepare.  Must take if your interested in Nature.  Knowing your 106 material helps with the phycology.,1
"Jose Morcillo is one of the best professors I have ever had in my last 4 years of university. He makes sure everyone participates, answers questions, and gives some of the easiest and useful tests ever. If you want an actual professor to treat you like a human, take him.",1
I should have gone to this site before I signed up for this class. This professor was very difficult. He didn't explain things very well and made you feel super dumb if you didn't understand something and tried to ask questions (even though he encourages questions). I understand A&P is hard.. but he was RIDICULOUS! Threatened extra credit too much.,0
"I don't hate many people. BUT I HATE THIS PROFESSOR! She is condescending, rude, conflict specific and incredibly uncompromisable. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. She is unfair with her grading, will not accommodate for sick days or family deaths   I'm a white male. one time she said to me, ""People like you need to realize they can't get their way"". wow. ",0
One of the sweetest & best math teachers I have ever had! SO caring & helpful when it comes to a students life as well as math in general. Very good at explaining & will answer any question in detail to make sure you fully understand. By being in her class you will realize how much she loves her job & wants to see students succeed. 100% recommend.,1
hes not that good of a teacher. he cant teach at all,0
She knows what she is teaching and makes sure everyone understands. Just make sure you read all the chapters and go over the slides and you can get an easy A in her class.,1
"Amazing professor, cares about his students. highly recommended.",1
Overall one of the best professors I have had in 3 years of college. It is a relatively difficult class but is well worth it. His lectures are very enjoyable and he lets the students get involved.,1
"I took Professor Yetman four years ago during my first semester at NJIT. Great guy and really knows the material. On a personal level he is also a friend to all students and will help you on any subject that you are stuck on, he is pretty much like an advisor to students throughout their degree years and as for FED, best one to teach it at NJIT.",1
Overall tough and unfair grader. Would not take again.,0
He's a pretty rad teacher. Just do your reading assignments and you'll pass all of his tests/journals.,1
"I've never met another professor who has put in as much effort at Prof. Yue. She is a very caring prof who gives it her all so that her students can get the most out of class and do well. She is always there to help you with anything you need. Lots of work (presentations, dialogue performances, quizzes and workbook HW) but you'll learn for sure.",1
"Best professor that I have every taken at CBC! He is so kind and passionate about art and is very approachable and easy to speak to. The lectures are long and a bit boring but take notes and you'll do just fine! He also gives extra credit which is nice. Also, accepts late work. You can find the book online for free!",1
"I wrote over 25 papers for this class -- 3 papers a week on average for INTRO to Literature. His essays are incredibly vague and you will have to go to office hours for help since he does not make it clear what he wants. I recommend taking any other professor for this course. Show up to class, read the material, and work for your grade.",0
"BEST GOSH-DARN PHYSICS PROFESSOR ON EARTH!!!! SIMPLY THE BEST!!! BETTER THAN ALL THE REST!! Homework  HAPPINESS, Tests  FUN FUN FUN AND EASY!!! EZ PZ!!! So put on a HAPPY FACE every time you are in the class! Study Study Study A'S!!!!!",1
"I got fooled by all the glowing comments. This teacher rewards the ones who does not work by extending deadlines more than once, and we who got bags under our eyes, giving everything before it was due, got nothing. Waits until you lost all of your sleep to anounce extensions. Very harsh grader. Not an iota of extra credit. Regret taking her.",0
"Obviously the student who complains about the recommended books does not read. I read the books recommended by the professor. Some have changed my life. He teaches with a level of enthusiasm I've not seen before. He grades grammar, and those who complain do not know proper English. Really, after 4 years at WSU? I appreciate Dr. Alderete. Thank you.",1
"Chris is the nicest guy you'll meet. Problem is, he has no idea how to teach and no idea how to get the right words across to you. You can't just sit and listen to him. If you want to get anything from his lectures, you have to pay extra close attention, think a little bit, and ask lots and lots of questions.",0
"TV studio, this guy knows it all but tried to rely on teaching us practical skills using quciktime videos of older lectures. Not a good idea as they were unwatchable and we had to get him to actively assist filming homework projects. This guy is very late at collecting and marking homework and so you dont get a sense of progression.",1
"Très long et plate, en plus de ça il n'est pas claire!",0
"I took Jeff's A&P hybrid course. I think he's a pretty good instructor. Always took the time to answer any questions you might have, even if it's off subject. The only issue I had was that he is late to class everyweek, but only 5 or 10 minutes. I would recommend taking his calss.",1
"Professor Thompson is the best professor I have had at USC. I was retaking 322b and he completely helped build my confidence back up in the course. His lectures are clear and concise, he isn't trying to trick you, and his exams are straightforward. He always answers questions and is very helpful outside of class. I would definitely take him again!",1
"Honestly the most boring class i've ever taken, it may not necessarily have been all her fault as the materials are bland, however she doesn't make it interesting at all and it's very hard to pay attention to her.",0
"Bridges almost every lecture gets off track with different topics. which makes lectures a little confusing sometimes. She tends to make a lot of arithmetic mistakes, however her tests are fairly easy. She gives written homework as well as webassign homework.",0
"Don't take him!!!!!!! Boring, sarcastic, and a very tough grader. Class is only based on essays no book work.",0
"He sucks tbh. He wont let you ask other students for HELP (he considered it cheating) hell call you out for other students to see, rude, unprofessional, and a horrible source of help or guidance. Dont take.",0
She is a wonderful and caring professor. She really wants you to succeed but at the same time your going to have to earn it. She understands life events and is willing to work with you to reschedule tests. She will really explain things to you and tries to determine your skill level and make it understandable.,1
"First time here at SCC and I am taking all Online courses. This teacher was absolutely amazing and she truly cares and wants you to succeed. I feel like her motto is she won't allow you to fail, her course is that organized and very easy to follow and understand. Her feedback is respectful and doesn't discourage you at all. Highly recommend!",1
one of the best classes at oneonta. also made me much better on the guitar. take this class,1
why is this guy employed at a 4-year accredited university? isn't there a community college or trade school he could be doing a mediocre job at? the man destroys the credibility for the  International Business Major at CofC,0
"A very hard class. there are a lot of memorization but he allows a cheat sheet.  Even though he was hard to understand, he was very dedicated to his students and the class. He held a lot of office hours if anybody needed help with homework. I would recommend to read and study the material before you go to him for help because he will get angry if y",1
"Of all the horror stories I heard from everyone who took this class from other instructors, Sheila definitely went out of her way to make this class an interactive fun learning experience. Attendance is mandatory, exam questions are straight from lecture, and labs are time consuming but doable. Definitely take her, she makes this class worth it. ",1
he reads his own notes that are so messy you can barely read it. terrible experience. tests are hand written and difficult to understand. tests have nothing to do with his notes or homework.,0
"She acts nice on the outside, but in her heart it has a duty to shatter every students' dream. Every week, she post practice quiz online and hands the real deal when we meet and all the questions doesn't make any sense. For the exams, they are roughly 70 questions and she expect us to know this. She doesn't even help her students at all.",0
"He is interesting. He clearly knows what he's talking about, but he's not great at explaining how to do it. He's a pretty nice guy and has a good sense of humor, but he's probably not the best person to take for intro into accounting. Four quizzes, drops the lowest grade. Lots of vocab, true or false questions on the quizzes, which is hard",1
"Ms. Jackson Is a great Professor and the best Com teacher of all time, all you have to do is take the weekly quizzes, do well on the speeches and you'll get an A.",1
Taking classes her was the best decision of my college life so far. I walked into her class knowing I was going to fail. She taught me to FAIL FORWARD. She is so loving and caring. She is committed to helping each student succeed. After taking several weeks of class I was able to see the only way I would fail her class was if I didn't try.,1
Must do assignment. Not allowed to go against her ideologies,0
She was a very good teacher but i didnt feel like i learned alot from her classes.,1
"easy to get a good grade if you follow her instructions and show up in the class. attendence is IMPORTANT!!!!i guess she mark it every class. lecture is a little bit boring, repeating ESLI things, the LITTLE BROWN HANDBOOK is more useful than her",1
"There's a reason there aren't any positive reviews for this professor. Reads slides during the lecture which can be found online, going to class is completely pointless. midterm much harder than the quizzes and homework and he doesn't curve grades, so good luck.",0
Very boring lectures even though the prof is nice. It is fairly easy to pass her classes because the exams are all projects. Attendance is mandatory (she makes us sign a paper at the end of the class) but I've worked on other projects in her class while she was talking. Easy A but boring.,0
"Teacher is knowledgeable on the topic of microeconomics, but her ""english second language"" accent can be distracting. Class was hard for me, but then again my interest in the subject is zero. All quizes are online, but final is in class. Two group projects to present to class throughout semester. Overall, meh.",0
Teacher was really leniant and helpful in certain situations.,1
"Soo much work! An excessive amount really, almost a hundred questions per chapter and you do two a week. Always includes a post with the work and she is an extremely hard grader. The work itself isn't too bad but it's very time consuming and very pointless.",0
"I had him for Global Patterns of Racism. He randomly assigns grades. He does not give good feedback and when he does, you can't read it because his handwriting is not legible. Many quizzes, a few essays. Very tough grader.",0
"Textbook is mandatory, lots of homework, and tests aren't difficult. He will give u a worksheet in the beginning of class and u could work on it alone or with a partner and then he'll go over SOME questions. If u have  a hard time understanding the way he teaches, he'll tell you to ask for a tutor instead of helping you get a better understanding.",0
If you care about your GPA and your mental health do not take his class. he is very rude and random with his attendance by asking a random question to a random person out of the blue. Only grade is midterm and final. Speaks in a low monotone voice and just rambles for three hours  & doesn't cover the material he expects you to know to test over.,0
"He's really good, and I was able to follow the formulas really well. I really liked the class! He's an easy going teacher and would have a few laughs in them.",1
"I withdrew from Ms. Lytle's class because she was very difficult to contact, seemed picky, and assigned a speech outline the first week without giving us any information or examples about how to do it. Perhaps she would be better in person.",0
"I ended this class with over 40 points of extra credit. All of the difficult assignments are done in class with her, and she walks you through all of it. She's super funny and nice, and the homework is pretty easy. The tests are fine as long as you know what you're doing. The midterm and final were pretty difficult, but the extra credit helps!",1
"""If you don't read EACH chapter THREE times before the test, you won't get above an 80."" He's not lying, his tests are extremely hard and you learn 20 chapters in 3 short months. Your saving grace will be the MindTap homeworks and the business plan. Really passionate marketing guy, really hard professor.",0
Worst class I have ever taken. I would not take another class from him in my life. ,0
After reading reviews on here I was scared to take his class. Glad I took it though. He's an amazing professor. Read syllabus before asking questions. He responds quickly. 3 assignments each week. His quizzes are based off his videos. His videos are extremely helpful. He's smart and knows what he's talking about. I would take him again.,1
"I signed up thinking this would be a fun French film class. He has taught it before and made that clear, heres the catch... it was a new book. He gave insane amounts of homework for absolutely no reason then we spent the whole class GOING OVER the homework. I learned nothing at all. Grading criteria was switched two weeks before the final.",0
"This class was not worth taking. I didn't enjoy the class at all, if you don't understand something he yells and slams his hands down on the table. He is very rude and doesn't help you understand anything in the course. The course itself is hard if you don't understand the materiel and has a lot of math work in it.  Maybe try another teacher.",0
Horrible professor. Might as well just be a full online class! i just found the class unorganized  and felt lost throughout the class. thankfully i passed.,0
"She is super hesitant to give As on anything. Even with little 10 point assignments; you do everything she tells you to do and you still won't get full credit. Must read the book from cover to cover to do good on tests. Also, lectures are a waste of time. Avoid taking!! ",0
"Funny dude, but thats where the list of positives end as far as his ability as a teacher.  Showing up to class was about as useful as watching bill nye the science guy re-runs. Useless teacher so enjoy learning everything yourself.  Hard tests but he does curve. ",0
Professor Petro is a great professor! I loved and enjoyed his class. His test are fair and he gives extra credit problems and a take home quiz. You have to keep up with the MyMathlab assignments in order to stay in track. I suggest that you go to every class to keep up.,1
"Awesome professor! I am terrible at math in general and she made me understand math topics I had failed in high school. Shes very good at explaining things and will take time to make sure every student is on board and clear with what is being taught before moving on. Had her for MAT 111, take her you wont regret it!",1
great professor very knowledgeable and excited about what he is teaching. makes sure everyone understands,1
The way she does her class is nightmarish first she makes the most interesting subjects seem boring she basically allows you to cheat on ur online quizs does not have a midterm but a cumulative final that is guaranteed to screw u over 90 MC 5 T/F 3 SA doesnt do a review class because she believe that you should of been studying all year,0
Great Professor I took him on-line and there are 8 test and  the 9 labs but you could take the test as many as 3 times if you fail just email him he is a very kind professor you will get a good grade if you just complete all the test and labs,1
"She is a great teacher,very sweet and very easy,she accepts ALL late work at anytime.",1
"Mrs. Warden is every freshman's nightmare. She manages to make ENGL 1010/ 1020 so unnecessarily difficult by her impossible ""grading"" rubric. You can do everything she tells you and she'll still take off points with no explanation. If you aren't clear about what to do, she'll simply say ""I already told you"". Her emails are unprofessional and rude.",0
"This was honestly one of the hardest classes I have ever taken in my life. His tests are extremely hard, and the Excel chapter of the course was the hardest test ever. All in all he is a great professor. He offers a TON of extra credit, you even get extra credit by participating in class. Just know that you will have to do a ton of outside work.",1
Best teacher ever!!,1
Best prof ive had so far at nyit. I took him last year spring && enjoyed him very much. I wish he taught every subject. Hes hilarious and a great teacher. He can make a caveman understand tmat lol,1
Awesome!  Had her for 2 classes now & love the flipped classroom method.  Fair grader and always returns stuff the next class.  My favorite in the chem dept!,1
"He makes learning about A&P easier, his lectures cover pretty much everything. He is always available for office hours, and has SI 2+ days a week. He does have an accent, but I could understand everything just fine. He has always been helpful and is great at making sure you really understand the material. I would take his clas s 100 times over!",1
She's tough but fair and she makes herself available to spend extra time with students.  Listen to everything she says. She is highly respected by her peers.,1
"Although she's occasionally witty, her lectures consist mostly of her reading off lists and statistics from her lecture slides. The work load is pretty light even though her project instructions are kind of convoluted.",1
Best Professor at UNO. He teaches a lot of good stuff and new trends. Dont miss his class if you get a chance.,1
Pretty easy class if you go and do your work on time. Make sure you do your outlines right and be there on the day of your speech.,1
"He talks about himself a lot, & his organizations. Seems ignorant and didn't spend much time teaching.",0
"Dr. Hauck is amazing! If you are taking genetics at Butler, definitely take Dr. Hauck.",1
"Tends to focus a bit too much on female students. Also has a nutjob following of ""converted"" students. More like a cult leader than a professor.",0
This professor was absolutely horrible. All she did during lecture was read her power point slides word for word. As if I can't read them myself. When test time came the answers to the questions could not be found anywhere in the slides or book. She expected you to have a deep understanding of the subject material without teaching it to you.,0
"Teach yourself the stuff. he teaches his class with videos and lectures (although, you'll probably get bored and stop listening). Not a particularly fun class, but he made me laugh...probably not on purpose.  I would say: TAKE THIS CLASS. He's not much fun, but it's an easy A...although he'll try to trick you into thinking his course is hard.",0
"Sis. Derby is a very nice person but a very hard teacher. If you don't do things exactly like she would do them, you will be marked down. It can be very discouraging. This course is also very difficult and time consuming. There is so much information thrown at you that it's hard to keep up. Expect to spend at least 20+ hours a week on assignments.",1
"Very hard, her tests are nothing like the review and the questions are VERY VERY VERY hard and she goes through the material very fast. Very hard teacher, if you can, please don't take her!",0
"Judy truly cares about the personal well being of her students and their internal learning more than tests.  You may take it bc its easy, but she'll care so much about you that you end up caring alot about the class, and learning.  And she's brilliant.",1
He is all over the place,0
"Glenn is pretty chill, some of the concepts are hard to digest, but if you ask questions you should be fine. Make sure you do the readings, you have a quiz on each one, and he asks petty stuff like ""where was this published."" This class opens your mind to different perspectives. Don't do your speech on zoos for utilitarianism :)",1
Easily the worst professor I have EVER had here in my time at Temple. Completely arrogant in many regards. Sees the world in his perspective and if you do not agree with him your wrong.  Worst books I have ever had to read for a class. DO NOT TAKE!!!!!,0
"Took her for ""Latin Nightclub Dance"" but really it was just a rhythm ballroom dancing class more than really ""latin"". Nonetheless, I learned a couple of moves to use while out dancing, and developed better rhythm than I had prior to this class. Just don't expect too much Spanish music. Also, super easy A. Just put some effort and you'll pass easily",1
No Comments,0
He is a good professor but it is impossible to do all homework if you have a full time job and is a full time student. It is too much reading and home every single week. I would not take him again because I am a full time student and also work full time. Plus my major is in business and I dont need all this work for my future.,1
"One of the smartest people ive met, if you want to learn about iran you have to take his class",1
As easy as it gets. S=how mild interest and he'll be thrilled. Never ontime. You won't learn much.,1
"Nelson is an outstanding teacher! She's a beautiful person, inside and out, and her goal is to help everyone understand the material/appreciate music. When giving examples of music terms, she either plays it on the piano or sings it quite well. Be sure to listen to the entire song in the listening homework, because she might trick you on the test.",1
I took this professor for race and culture 101. He is a very harsh grader and expects you to do above the required amount. He grades assignments very late and finds any reasons to dock you off points. Would highly recommend to avoid him as a professor.,0
"hands down BEST MATH TEACHER EVER! She is so awesome at explaining math and very detail on steps. She makes sure the whole class understands the formula, and she hands out extra credit, which is awesome !",1
"Mr. Kanetis is the best. He's hilarious and really easy to get along with. If you show up, pay attention and participate, it's an easy A. I highly recommend taking him.",1
Tom is the reason I started to love math ;),1
"Worst teacher I've ever had, homework is worth the most in her class and she grades it extremely hard, DO NOT SIGN UP FOR HER CLASS,  I showed up for every class, did every homework, and passed every test with a B- or higher. I'm a honor student and she failed me",0
"This is the most arrogant, conceited, awful prof I have ever had. I only attended class because participation matters, always dreaded going. Make sure you are paying attention, because the second he notices you look away - he will put you on the spot. Don't even think about disagreeing with him. If you are shy and don't like talking in class AVOID!",0
"He's a funny guy and I don't have anything against him as a person, but as a professor he leaves something to be desired. He can and will ramble the whole class, and he's a very confusing grader; he rarely gives a reason for the grades he gives and although attendance is mandatory, he picks and chooses what days he actually takes it. He's just eh.",0
"The semester, i feel, was not thoughtfully planned out...so much work crammed in at the end, pop-up assignments. Nice lady...wouldn't take her again if i had a choice.",0
"Not a very helpful professor. Doesn't care about his students. If the choice is between him and Falzone, go Falzone, or go home.",0
"This professor took long to get things graded and when you ask him about it he will blame it on his TA who you will never meet and does not even live in the same state. He will also not care about your grades. If he doesn't grade something right the first time, he never will. He will respond to emails but they are likely not helpful.",0
Man is awful at teaching i dont even want to rant. believe me or not but get ready to read the book,0
"This professor does not know what he is doing in a classroom. Do not for the life of you take this class. The material is extremely simple, but the way he grades makes it very difficult to get a good grade. Be prepared to teach yourself.",0
"Professor Lamkin is a tough teacher.  Pros: She gives a lot of extra credit, she goes over some questions for midterm, answers all questions Cons: She teaches as if she is just reviewing which makes it hard to learn, test do not really correlate with her notes. Overall, she makes it easy to pass with a C, as you only need 700 out of 1220 points.",1
"Quizzes everyday on the reading, but all tests are comprised of those quiz questions plus some questions from the lectures. Really not a difficult class, Professor Stoner knows what he's talking about and  if you need some extra help, he is totally willing to help you. Not difficult to make a good grade if you put forth the effort.",1
"I was terrified of theory but she made it so easy.  online, open note tests. doesn't post the notes on blackboard. you have to go to class but she keeps it interesting.  breaks down the writing so that it is much easier.  extremely helpful if you need it. need the book. ",1
"Good guy, good teacher",1
"Participate and do the homework. This is a language class, and Sensei Garrissi expects you to speak the language in the class.",1
"Today in class this professor threatened a student who was talking out of turn: ""if you keep talking, the next thing you'll get is the clop!"" She did this twice. If you want a teacher who threatens violence to her students, by all means take her class. You should also know that her teaching methods are ancient, outdated, and often ill advised.",0
Class is too hard. Exam questions are undoable unless you have access to the questions ahead of time. The labs/assignments are irrelevant to what you actually need. Avoid if you can.,0
"Took her for sociology and gender sociology. Amazing professor, her classes are very interesting! She has a unique grading policy,  you do have homework and short online reading/quizzes/surveys which help your grade A LOT!  Even if you are bad test taker, other things can fix your grade! Very approachable. Not an easy A though, effort needed!",1
"He is a good guy but average TEACHer. Reads his lectures straight from the slides, attendance is not mandatory but the tests are difficult. Difficult as in he curves every test because the average grades are so poor. Teach your self type of class.",1
"6 labs and 3 exams. However, if you fail any of the exams, you wouldn't pass. Tip: either read the entire textbook or go through as many quizlets as possible. Very clear and straightforward.",1
DO NOT TAKE!! Failed to communicate - took 3 weeks to answer questions regarding mid-term. Mid-term and final are essay formats. He is not organized and doesn't seem to be engaged or knowledgeable. Do yourself a favor and choose another professor.,0
"I was looking for a math professor based on the reviews on this website and fortunately I found his class available. I took his and wouldn't feel regret. His lectures are easy to understand, and you always have review for the exams. As long as you study well the review, you will do good with the exams.",1
"Mrs. McGee is a great professor. You will have to work hard though, she grades the open ended questions pretty toughly, but she gives you study guides so you know what to expect. You will be able to pass if you put the work in, and she posts the powerpoints online so that you're able to stay on track.",1
Professor Dunham was a great teacher. Clear understanding what is expected. 90% of the work is done in groups. He is a caring professor that will work with you.,1
"Professor Lulejian interacts with the class and is very helpful. There were a couple of things I didn't like about the class: First, the tests seemed like they are setup to confuse you. Second, you aren't able to see what you got wrong on the tests, so you can't fix your errors for the exams. Other than that, it was a good class.",1
His class is realistically a 10 credits class worth of work.  So be prepared...,0
"The best teacher I have had at western so far. She is nice, helpful and easy to talk to. You can be yourself in her class with out a problem. Hope she doesn't leave western:)The work is simple but its really good to learn and helpful for the next english class.",1
"Do not take him!!!! He dose not know how to teach. If you take him then basically you are on your own, he will not help you to pass the class.",0
"He is one of the best professor I have ever seen in my life if you want to get a good knowledge about history and of course, if you want to pass I will definitely recommend gis class he is the best !!!!!!",1
"Material is so unclear and when you ask for clarity the teacher gives you his opinion. He will ask you your understanding of the material, don't raise your hand... its a trap. Unless its his ideology its wrong.  Extremely repetitive and covers nothing.  Also he has a serious attitude problem.",0
"I definetly dont suggest anyone to take this professor. Unless your willing to have a hard time comprehending what it is that he wants you to do. Although I think he is very knowledgeable, he seriously does not know how to teach.",0
"Class is disorganized and doesnt have clear expectations. Lectures are long, boring and not organized. Doesnt have the ability to connect with any students, and often asks questions that only he knows the answer to. If you think you know the answer he probably wont accept it. Noticeably annoyed  when answering any students questions.",0
"Dr. Haldane does a great job of making the class interesting and relevant to what students want to learn about. This class was very small and so it became largely discussion led. I would definitely recommend Dr. Haldane as she communicates what she wants on assignments very clearly, and doesn't simply assign ""busy work.""",1
"This class is awesome. It involves a lot of work, but nothing you cant handle. She gives lectures the whole length of the class, but they are very helpful and interesting. The group project is fun at the end of the semester and as long as you do your work and show enthusiam, you will definitley pass. I would recommend this class!",1
"Professor Pangallozzi is a knowledgeable professor, but I felt the class was disorganized. She was definitely very busy and was not easy to get in touch with. This class was online, the course might be more organized in person.",0
"She makes the subject interesting, her lectures are easy to listen to and she brings in a smattering of guest lecturers that are as erudite as she and just as fun to watch. She always makes sure you know what she expects and what you are expected to learn. Best teacher I've ever had.",1
"Melanie doesn't try to embarrass people or be hard on students. She is very direct and that's just how Deaf Culture is; it's not about you, get over it. She is always helpful, humorous, and if you do the work, you'll excel and improve your skills! If you can't take feedback from a professor, then good luck being an interpreter...",1
"Shawn Richards? Favorite teacher at Humber College. He cares about his students and them succeeding not in life; if he saw that I wasn't 100% myself, he would speak to me during the break and get me back in high spirits. He challenges you! If you don't PAY ATTENTION, you won't pass, it's as simple as that. Work for your grades!",1
Great professor. If you're looking for a super easy A take her! All you have to do is try. There are like four or five papers and that's it. She was so sweet!!! ,1
Connie is so sweet and so understanding. She is very ethical and very professional. She is such a good person and she really cares about her students and does all she can to help them succeed!,1
"I really like how enthusiastic Humphrey is, but his lectures are straight out of the textbook. He also posts his lectures online, so if you miss, it's easy to catch up. His study guides are ONLY FOR THE OPEN ANSWER QUESTIONS. So make sure you study all your notes. I hate the tests, but the essays are easy. Get ready to read a book on communication.",1
"A 20-point curve is added to each assignment. The highest test average was a 60, and all other tests had an average below 60. He is extremely hateful when a question is asked- regardless of the question. As a student who has succeeded in every aspect of college, this man lowered my self-esteem.",0
"Overall a good guy.  He has some really good real world experience and it shows.  He tells you to always ""google"" it first and hates when you ask him something he already answered.  I guess that's how it works after college though.  I'd recommend his class.",1
"Professor wider is a very fun and energetic professor, he expects his students to read material and quizzes are basically every class but is very easy. Gave 3 tests of multiple choice, true or false, and fill in. Cool professor definitely",1
she is really bad...she didnt help me at all...the class was a waste of money and time. dont take her class.,0
"Phenomenal teacher, took her for my calc 1 class during the summer and it was much easier with her as the teacher. She makes sure you understand the formula, constantly asking whether you have questions or not. If you do have a question she will happily answer it with a response that often makes the issue go away. Would recommend to future students",1
Super easy 5 week summer class. Discussion Boards and quizzes are very easy.,1
Picks favorites. Make sure she likes you within the first few courses or she'll tear you apart. Is unnecessarily rude when giving feedback. Worst class with the worst professor ever. ,0
"Overall an amazing professor, always there to help and is very open.",1
"Great teacher with a lot of knowledge, at first I was afraid of not passing his class, but he helped me a lot, after so many years I decided to come back to school and finish my degree and Mr. Luckett was a great inspiration person to me, very dedicated to his job in helping us gain knowledge in the social work field. Great professor!",1
"I didn't mind Dr. Lim as much until the final.  I've gotten higher than 95 on all my homework, A's on both of my midterm and 100 on the semester project, and I left finals with an overall of B-....... The 3 hours exam was so freaking hard, I didn't finish in 4 hours... and trust me, I studied my ass of for that class. so good lucj if you take him.",0
"Her attention span is very small. One cough and she'll stop the whole class to talk about our flu shots, then she spends an hour talking about that, then complains that we're so behind. She's unorganized. She'll come to class late and leave because she forgot our work. She made me delete a whole paragraph because the ""vocabulary was much too hard"".",0
"Dr. Landrum was great! His notes were clear and they were just like the tests. He has multiple choice, matching, and two essays on his tests. He gives good guidance on how to study for the essay sections. He gives quizzes on almost everything you read... READ EVERYTHING ASSIGNED. The syllabus is clear and accurate. I am taking him again next term.",1
Mrs. Sundberg is extremely confusing. Quite frankly she doesn't teach anything. Very bothersome and the pace of the class is super slow. One paper will take you like 3 weeks to write because she likes steps instead of rough drafts. I would fight god before I take her class again.,0
not a good teacher avoid at all cost. oh believe me..,0
"Terrible professor. Isn't clear with the topics she's discussing; she starts talking about something then completely changes the subject or moves on to say something else. I passed with a B+, however, I would never take her again. I dreaded going to her class and listening to her lectures. She was all over the place.",0
Learned allot. He is very detailed. Knows his stuff.  Adds fun to class.,1
"Unclear criteria in exams. Teaches his own developed tool that doesn't work half of the time and expects you to peform like you are a 10 years experienced developer. Just like any other professor, he is just sweet on the top but will not give you any marks. SKIP SKIP SKIP.",0
Terrible and deleted my last rating.,0
This was by far the hardest class I have taken. All of his work is close together. The good thing is he realizes that and works with you on the time frame. Be prepared to STUDY!!! He does not allow enough time for quizzes and exams and they are extremely difficult!,0
"This class deteriorated my mental health this semester. Dr. Brown's tests are multiple choice - no partial credit. This resulted in me failing tests despite somewhat understanding the content. His lectures are just awful - an hour of rambling and not much else. Please take this course with a different professor - or better yet, at Wake Tech.",0
"Buck was a great Professor. He had pretty clear lectures and made sure everyone was on the same page. He will occasionally make mistakes on the board during lecture and if you correct him he will give you extra points on the next exam. Show up to class, take notes, and study the sample exams he gives before the actual exam. He made Calc 2 enjoyable",1
I have taken this class elsewhere as an undergrad. At SFSU I took this at a graduate level expecting further depth. Was disappointed in the quality of the material. The instructor has experience in image processing but clearly is behind the curve in AI and pattern analysis. Not worth my time or money. ,0
"The class itself if so easy.  All you have to do is read some ancient story and then he'll discuss it in the next class period. There are mini quizzes everyday which are simple. All you do is watch movies. He cracks down on all cell phone usage, even though his goes off all the time. Wont let you leave until he dismisses you.",0
"Even if you read the free textbook, he will ask you things you can't find anywhere else besides HIS lectures. 2 lecture quizzes per week, 1 chap reading quiz + discussion prompts per week, 3 exams: 60 mult choice, final exam: 120 mult choice, & once a week time-consuming Problem Sets that you will hate. Hard grader w extra credit opportunities.",0
"Spanish is difficult if you've never taken it before. I've taken spanish for a long time, but this professor is very willing to help you during her office hours and even lets you make up missed work (unless its a habit) She gave up on the online part of the class because it was too hard. Shes a great teacher and is hysterical! TAKE HER!",1
Literally the worst professor I have ever had!!! She is not clear at all of what you are suppose to be doing. There is a research project that is the span of the class and she doesn't let you know what to do until the day before it is due and then gets mad that you didn't start it months earlier. ,0
"Madness. This teacher took an incredible subject such as ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY and made it mind numbingly boring. Shes an incredibly nice person and she means well, plus her kindness can not be over stated but this class is SO BORING.... it should be a class that stimulates a psych student to thirst for more!!! But, I regret taking this teacher!",0
"Lenhart is my favorite professor at the University so far. He makes a genuine effort to make sure that all of his students understand the material and are doing well in the class. If you have a question, just ask, and he will more then likely explain in simpler terms so that you can understand. Would definitely recommend for both Micro and Macro.",1
"One of the better teachers I've had in college.  Very entertaining, and gets you interested in learning the subject.  Pretty nice, funny, and makes you feel comfortable to ask questions, and for help.  I'd take him again if I could.",1
"Conta is an excellent instructor. He spent time on the street, as a Sgt, an investigator and a trainer in the academy with LAPD. He bleeds LAPD blue. He has stories for everything. Show up to class, play attention and you will do well. The only complaint I have is that some of his knowledge is out-dated, but still generally applicable.",1
HIST 424 changed my life!  The genuine passion of Dr. Tone quickly connected our class creating a unique open space and honest space to approach carefully selected fascinating subjects. Dr. Tone is incredibly knowledgeable and conveys extraordinary compassion towards her students.  It was such a privilege to take this class!,1
"Great Guy- Cares about his athletes. Relates to his students and makes 2 hour lectures based on ""Micro-Economics"" actually interesting and bearable to sit through.",1
"Very hard to contact! Does not answer emails and is very unclear when he does! He makes it very difficult to succeed in his class, and he lets you know that as a student! We are beneath him as students! Stay clear! Avoid at all costs!",0
"Imagine the perfect cross between Mr. Rogers and Tom Cruise, that's Prof. Wellborn. He is mellow but loud, clear and energetic and listening to his lectures is like watching a movie. half of my in class life since middle school has consisted of desk napping until his class because he neatly embeds extra loud passionate bursts into his lectures.",1
I took the adv SummerA  6 weeks long. We did 3 chapters a week- watching 3 hours of lecture per ch. & doing a hmwk & a quiz for each ch. HmWk took me about 2-4 hours each you can redo them to. Quiz took about 90 mins each. Prepare to spend 15-20 hours a week for the adv 6 week course. Great lectures! Responds to questions. Do the work and get an A.,1
"Literally do not take this professor. I took this as a mandatory credit and will be receiving my first C ever in college. He grades as if everyone in his class will be professional writers. Not clear in feedback, nor does he ever talk about how he wants papers to be written. I do admit that the class discussions are interesting but not worth it.",0
She is very boring. The first 3 classes have been about GALILEO and research. She seems to mean well but her teaching style is so bad. She tells long unimportant stories that arent relevant to the course. Best part is the open text/ open google tests. Shes really liberal about device usage. Dont ask questions cause shell go off on a tangent.,0
Never seemed to respond to my emails so that was tough when an assignment was confusing. Overall the class was pretty easy but it is definitely a lot of tedious work. Same thing every week.,0
"There is no question that Dr. G is the best professor at the University. If you can't handle a heavy workload then simply dont take his classes. If you love the environment like I do, then the workload is no problem. I loved every second of the class, & I look for more classes to take with him every semester. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! (any class by him)",1
I have never hated a class or professor more than this guy. This website doesn't allow me to express how i really feel about him. All the negative reviews are correct. Do yourself a favor and take another class.,0
Lectures were so monotone. It was very unclear what he is looking for on exams. Take this class with a different professor if you can.,0
Professor Cramer is a saint among men. He's very understanding when it comes to unforeseen situations sometimes plague students and late assignments. By far one of my favorite professors at Suffolk.,1
"Dr. A is a great guy. He is very smart, but his lectures are HARD. Spatial Analysis is impossible. BUT there is a HUGE curve if you actually try hard. Taking notes in class makes no difference. Just don't get behind on studying. Takes attendance 10x at random so go to class. DO problem sets and go on extra credit labs.",0
"I have never left a rating, but this dude is something else. Anything that isn't auto-graded in mindtap is graded like sh*t. Group projects are a nightmare, attendance is a grade and I was marked absent for a no-class holiday and wasn't given credit. Emails take years to be responded to. Basically do not take unless there is no other option. BIG NO",0
"VERY unprepared - shows up a little late but the powerpoint he just reads off then has you do the example. The answer to it is not available online. Tells you to put everything in calculator in 1 go and wouldn't go over your work really. Homeworks are LONG, if you don't know how to use R, he don't either. Doesn't put in grades timely at all.",0
"Dr. Pan is extremely knowledgeable on the subject and takes the course at a great pace. His Materials Science class was one of the most enjoyable I've had so far. Learned a lot, two tests were fair, not much homework, no final.   Last month of the class was just group project presentations, which was actually pretty great!  Did I mention no final?",1
Hes an okay teacher. He's passionate about the topics and lectures are pretty interesting.  However nothing is ever graded on time. He will grade everything on the last day of class so you have no idea how you're doing throughout the semester. Also grading is VERY inconsistent.,1
Professor Gray loves what she does but in my opinion she is not the best professor even though a lot of people love her.  She just lectures and has power points that have endless slides.  She often rambles and gets off topic and her tests are extremely hard.  The tests never have anything she taught in class.  Try to avoid her for this class.,0
Professor Meacham knows the content really well. Questions are welcome and you will get in-depth answers no matter what questions you ask. You can feel that she does her best to make assignments as clear as possible.,1
Unable to understand him. I would say you should go to class because every once in a while you get important equations necessary to do well in the class. however most of the time he spends the entire class teaching the unnecessary theoretical ideas of topics. find a tutor for this class and pay attention to recitation otherwise will fail. ,0
Eric is not a good teacher. He will have you do all your homework online and he gives a quiz every time your in class and they are timed. He's not helpful.,0
McDonald's lab is probably one of the better classes I've taken here. You learn a lot of technical procedures (get ready to do 5 hours of gel electro. every week) but it is useful and you get enough time and leeway to do everything required. McDonald is also a notoriously easy grader and just a really nice guy. PS. don't take if you hate bugs!,1
"Dont buy textbook. There are 3tests, mathxl hw/quiz grade and final exam. She really cares about her students and is willing to help. I would definitely take her again.",1
"Not the best. Great guy with interesting life stories, but not the best teacher. Classes are unorganized, tests are awful and hard and make up most of your grade. Attendance is mandatory and he has no sympathy for outside circumstances. 5 question quizzes on every chapter. Do the reading and then some. Don't take him, he killed my GPA :(",0
"class was absolutely useless, so was the homework. Read the book in each and every detail, because it will be asked on the exam. HORRIBLE teacher, do not take Stats with him.",0
"Really boring lectures, really quiet speaking . . . half the time spent in class is awkward silence while she waits for someone to answer the question she just asked.  If you don't drink a cappuccino before class, then bring a pillow.",0
She's inexperienced and it shows. She doesn't know how to give a good writing assignment or run a class. Her grading process is absolutely nuts!!,0
She makes class interesting. There is a lot of reading but manageable and she manages to make a boring story bearable with fun discussions. I have an A so I think she's a fair grader. ,1
"Dr. Wang is a wonderful professor.  I have had her for all three of my Calculus classes, and enjoyed every minute of it.  The course work is very simple and not that time consuming.  I definitely recommend a person take Dr. Wang for their math courses.",1
Don't listen to the rest of these reviews because they are faker than a flying talking unicorned donkey wrestling a rich tax paying man who also does the dishes and his own laundry. Dr. Evan's is a sweet sweet prof. who bless his heart tries his best but.... you know he is special in a not good kinda way.,0
He is a teacher that acts like you already know how to complete this math. I spent most of the class lost. During lectures he talks so damn fast and again acts like we know everything that he's doing.,0
This instructor is really great. She takes the time to explain the problems. She gives extra credit every class. I can really appreciate this instructor compaired to my other instructors.,1
Shes only given out one A in her entire career of teaching is her story on syllabus day. I don't know why I stayed enrolled but wish I wouldn't of. The classes are boring and a lot of reading. She has no enthusiasm as a teacher and drills you with homework and papers.,0
"Very unclear of what she wants you to do. You will never have the right answer for her. No matter how hard you try in her class it always seems like it isn't good enough. Can be rude at times. Not interesting. She will lose your papers and then tell you ""oh well"" or give them back you a week later. I would not recommend to take her. ",0
"I ended up having to drop this class. During the lectures he would continually get off topic and when I would ask a question, it wouldn't get answered properly. He would assign us 200-400 problems a week of online homework, which I was never able to complete, even after spending five days a week in the learning lab. I would not recommend taking him",0
"Good suggestions on color mixing, paint handling. Poor management of class time. Critiques went way over; she stayed later to finish & implied that anyone who didn't stay was not committed. As a single parent w child care obligations I had no choice but to leave, although I was hugely committed. Left a bad taste, insensitive, elitist.",0
"I have scored high 90s and even a 100 on exams but her projects bring your grade down immensely, She's such a tough grader and expects you to do exactly what she wants BUT doesn't tell you what she wants.",0
I highly recommend taking Dr. Reese's online course. He gives you a very clear syllabus with all the dates on it of when everything will be due and all assignments are due on the same dates every week. A few quizzes here and there and one paper. He's also very good at getting back to you when you need to contact him.,1
"Britten seems to genuinely mean well, but the woman simply wasn't called to teaching. Doesn't actually seem to care and is not particularly engaging. The text is useless but mandatory, and the lectures are meandering and poorly created. She also has far too many guest speakers and decides not to show up on a whim. If at all possible, do not take it",0
He is a nice guy but should not be a professor. He does not teach anything and expects people to know the material before we even mention it in class. His idea of teaching is going over problems that we have not learned yet. Avoid him if you can. The only saving grace to taking him is the curves you will get since the tests are so hard.,0
"Great teacher, really makes you comfortable.",1
One of my favourite professors of the program. Very knowledgeable and interactive.  A highly recommended prof.,1
"Decent teacher, but he was not understanding at all when I had a severe case of the flu and had to go to the ER on the day of a test. A doctors note from the ER was not enough for him to allow me to retake this exam. I spoke with the dean on this matter and applied for a grade appeal. I highly advise everyone against taking this class with Knox.",0
"Very interesting class, keeps the subjects very stimulating and pretty much hands you the exams beforehand so you can prepare for it...TF graded the papers a little harsh though...all in all if you're an IR major, it will seem pretty boring the first part of the semester seems irrelevant but the last quarter is the ""IR"" part of the course",1
I took her class twice and found out there was other people in the same class that took her class twice. I notice people dropping her class with complaints I truly thought I was doing great in her class to find out I got a D at the end of the semester now I have to retake the class before I can take any other my classes ,0
"Very nice person, easy to be friends with. Don't let it fool you though, he is here to make sure you're learning. 10/10",1
"I would never take a class with Dr. Miura again. He took a long time to respond to emails and when he did they were not clear. His office hours were not helpful. He grades extremely hard and expects you to rewrite his definitions word for word on tests. If you do take him, try to get high grades on the homework, it's worth 25% of your grade.",0
"I had a teacher say once that in math and chemistry if teachers use scantrons they are just lazy and that is so true. This gy uses all scantrons so it doesn't matter if you really know this stuff but make a minor calculation error you still get no credit for what you do know. Take from Hodge, his tests let you show what you've learned.",0
"She is nice, but most of the times she would talk about the Cubs game. She tries to make the class fun, and time is not efficiently spent. At times she was not helpful, and would not recommend to everyone. ",0
"I wouldn't recommend her online EDU104 class to anyone. She doesn't respond to emails  in a timely manner, and when she replies it sounds like she thinks you're stupid. It also seems like she thinks this class is the only class you're taking and you have no other responsibilities. ",0
"He seems kind of funny when he makes jokes in class, but he's terrifying. He calls on you in class so pray he doesn't know your name. He doesn't give clear information about what is going to be on tests/quizzes. He expects you to know the lab manual by heart and doesn't go over the theory in them. He will grill you during lab presentations. BEWARE!",0
No longer teaching. Professror Emeritus. Laid a good foundation for future teachers to model. His clarity of thought and instruction has helped me in my upper level courses. Master teacher,1
"Calm, cool guy. He explains things in detail, always answers questions and makes the occasional corny joke. Doesn't expect you to memorize random data, but expects you to understand the purpose behind the experiments. Really good professor. Also, he lets you call him Dr. K because he knows his name is hard.",1
"An interesting guy. You basically do nothing in class. I took the service learning class and everything was done online. I'm not sure if it's like that for his other classes. He's nice, but cancelled class 4 times. Basically don't even worry about showing up to class more than a few times. You'll just watch movies that have nothing to do w English.",1
"Like another review said, Marek is an overall good person and a good engineer, however he is an absolutely terrible prof. As said, he's a very nice person and will answer your questions if you have them. But that's where the good ends. Pointless lectures, constantly stutters during those lectures, mind-boggling grading criteria and so much more.",0
"By far, the most amazing teacher I've ever had. He opens up every door of opportunity for his students to succeed. He deserves more recognition than words can describe.  He's changed my life!                                       R. Harbut",1
"Jiming is one of the best ITM professors at CSUEB. His exams are tough, takes almost the whole class period to finish the midterm and final, but he allows you notes full page front and back which helps a lot. Show up to classes because he gives 3 quizzes unannounced and drops one of them which is 20percent of your grade.",1
This is by far my favorite professor here at SUNY Cortland. He ties in all his lectures with real life examples which helps extremely when learning the material. He is very enthusiastic and makes learning a fun experience and he is very available for office hours and willing to help. He wants all his students to succeed in the class,1
I have mixed feelings about Orser. She's a sweet woman and all that and I have taken more than one class with her but she can be extremely unclear about what she wants from assignments and her lectures are very messy. Take her at your own discretion I guess.,0
I don't know why there aren't more reviews about Holly but she's great! She's super funny and a tough grader. She likes to throw you into the deep end and see how you do and is sometimes ambiguous about what she wants unless you specifically ask her. The idea is to make the most out of her class by participating. She will help if you ask her.,1
This is a bad teacher i had so far in north carolina state university. avoid this teacher at any cost. he is the worst teacher you can imagine.,0
"I LOVE LAURA ZINK! I. LOVE. HER. SHE.IS.AMAZING! Such a great teacher, very passionate about the subject she teaches, open to talking to students after during office hours about ANYTHING. Every single hand out and lecture contained meaning and was very useful. Take her class if you want to learn to write well.",1
lectures are unorganized and boring. Feedback i recieved on my papers (which were the majority of the grading) were 1-2 bullet points that were not constructive at all. I wish i didn't take this course.,0
"This online class was my least favorite business class of all time.  The instructor assigns an obscene amount of homework for how basic the class is.  I was also not a fan of having ALL homework, assignments, quizzes, etc due on FRIDAY NIGHT.  Ouch!  Expect hours of busy work and an absolutely detestable TWO group projects that made no sense!",0
"Mrs. Griffin was a great professor. She made sure to cover the material well. She made us study guides and even tutored students before and after class. She cares about her students and their success. If you ask her for help, she will help you. You do have to do your part as a student, which means you read chapters and study notes.",1
"Madame Petcoff is a cute, little French professor, that makes class fun. She's a bit scattered at times, but it's endearing. Lots of in-class presentations, she marks for participation. Google search for additional clarification. Her tests aren't bad, review and be sure to know your verbs/tenses/numbers. I loved her class!!!!",1
I loved this class! Dr. Irani is awesome. The topics are interesting and te prof does a really nice job making it fun and easy to understand.  She is always available to help out and you can tell she knows a lot and wanted us to really understand what we were  reading and learning. There are online assignments which I liked too.  A must take!,1
"She is awesome. Willing to help you understand the information. Study powerpoints, no surprises on test everything comes from notes. She records her lecture so you can go back and listen if you need!",1
take this class this guy is so cool and funny. like he doens't take the class super serious seriously one of the best classes i took.. TAKE HIM!!,1
"He is seriously the most unfair grader I've had in college.  His exams test reading comprehension and whether or not you know WHAT he's asking, not whether or not you know the answers and have covered the materials. His TAs are unhelpful as well and if you ever have Kassuhun, your grade is seriously doomed, no matter how much of the work you do.",0
"Murtuza cares for his students and tries his best, but will leave you a little confused at times. But if you ask him a question he will happily clear things up. He gives you packets every class and yes you will have to teach yourself, but its manageable. His reviews for the midterm and final are key to doing well STUDY THEM! 2 easy projects too.",1
"Took two classes (335 and 352) with him and I respect him quite a bit. He got a PhD in JUnit testing, what a mad lad. He's very knowledgeable about programming and is capable of engaging in good discussions about the material. Sometimes, it seems like he's condescending, yeah, but I feel like that's because he thinks this is easier material",1
"EXTREMELY USELESS. Doesn't get to the point at all. Skips through 10 slides at a time and speaks only about how iPads and iPods are revolutionizing the world. If you get her, SWITCH TO ALEC CRAM. He's much better!",0
He was a good professor and was very knowledgeable of the material. 4 tests that were 25 questions and 4 assignments worth 10 points. 140 points makes up this class with a few extra credit assignments.  For 100 level course the tests were somewhat difficult. Overall good class and professor.,1
"She is very helpful with her studies, lesson are online and if you are able to move quickly you are welcome to do so. She is very helpful of making sure you understand the lesson at hand. I enjoyed her lot.",1
She was the best teacher ever. She is very kind and if we ask her a question she will definitely answer your questions very clearly. She will have homework passes to get extra credits,1
"He loves to make jokes and the stuff he covers in class is easy, but he makes the tests quite difficult. Read the chapters thoroughly and go to class. All the extra credit goes a long way. Nice guy.",1
He is one of the best professors at SLU. Take him if you ever get the chance.,1
"Had him for intro to lit. He is a really cool guy. You go to his class, read soemthing, leave. It's really dumb if you fail his class because it is so easy. He's really helpful. I hate poetry, but he helped me understand it. Take this class!!!!!",1
Great professor that is passionate about his work and wants you to learn the material,1
"Avoid taking her for Phisiology. She is extremely horrible instructor for this subject and should not be allowed to teach it. She doesn't answer her emails, she is not thorough about what is covered on her exams. The study guides are almost useless. She is not very clear in explaining the material on her PowerPoints. This is by far the worst class!",0
Your review is graded at the same time as your test so go over your review with a tutor to make sure you have something correct to look at for your test. Tests and reviews are only graded by percentage you will not know what you got wrong unless you specifically talk to teacher.,0
"No sympathy on grading during the fire, despite the fact that no work was supposed to be assigned. Told me to my face, I wasn't ""affected enough"" by the fire to get any extensions or help even though I was displaced. His lectures were off topic and not related to the course work. EVERYDAY he'd literally pull up news sites and say ""talk about this"".",0
Grades are based on tests but if you study you will pass. Professor Bronie makes sure you understand and is tough sometimes but is caring.,1
Scanlon is rude. No way around it. I was afraid to ever ask questions and he made me uber nervous in lab. Avoid taking him at all costs. ,0
"He is a really nice guy and speaks really clear. If you go to class and take notes, you should be fine. There are assigned books, but I never read them and still got an A. Don't buy the books, just lookup important quotes. Tests are just essays, which blows, but if you pay attention it's really easy.",1
"Good teacher.  He's fair but also firm with standards.  Some people complained cause they didn't get the grade they wanted, but if you're actually willing to do the work and put in the effort, it's totally doable.  Highly recommend.",1
"Andor is great and I really enjoyed his class. I wish he would show fewer films in class, though - I work full time and missing work to watch a movie was really frustrating, especially when it was on youtube and could've easily been just watched at home instead of wasting valuable class time. Not a very challenging class, but a fun one.",1
"I loved Professor Landrum. He does only lecturing, no activities but he tries his best to make them interesting. Only have quizzes and tests so you HAVE to stay on top of your reading. However, his tests are easy. Very straight forward, no trick questions. Definitely recommend him!",1
"Personnellement, je l'ai trouvé fort intéressant. Il est fortement qualifié en comptabilité donc j'appréciais ses anecdotes. Le cours ne devrait pas être difficile si vous mettez les efforts nécessaires pour bien faire la simul. Je vous conseille de la faire seul et de comparer avec d'autres étudiants pour bien comprendre la matière du final.",1
No Comments,0
1 word- BORING! It was honestly the worst class i've had so far.,0
"She knows a lot about teaching elementary kids. Her classes are very practical and usefull. She will give good feedbacks, but I think many people don't understand that this is what a professor is supposed to do, so some people don't appretiate her as they should.",1
"10/10 recommend I loved this class! He takes role every class but his class is enjoyable. 2 midterms, 5 homework assignments and a final. He gives study guides which are a list of terms from the section and you just need to memorize the definition. That is basically the test. No math or case study in this class. Only memorization. Super easy class!",1
She's really nice and always seems upbeat.  She's just hard to pay attention to.,1
DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR FOR STATISTICS. MAKES YOU TAKE WRITTEN TEST THAT TAKES UP MAJORITY OF THE TEST TIME AND IS EXTREMELY BORING.,0
"Do not take Mr. Weiner's class. Do not. He doesn't answer questions, there are a lot of assignments. He is stubborn in his opinion. He can be very rude. The class is like a high-level sociology class instead of an intro class. There is so much reading and if you don't understand it he patronizes you. Just find some other professor, please.",0
"SWEET person, bad professor. The readings were so boring and the assignments were so long. All 6 projects took a substantial amount of time and she talks and talks and talks and talks. You get bored. Really bored.",0
"I would strongly recommend going with any other professor for this class. Extremely random and heavy lectures, notes will be all over the place. Most of the tests and quizzes have questions either never covered, strongly opinionated, or way more specific than emphasized. No assisting material to study, expected to research unknown topics.",0
Very tedious work and you have to pay to take the final and midterm and to have someone watch you. Not flexible about deadlines either. She's rude through email as well.,0
"Easy to understand with an accent. kinda boring, will make you want to skip every once in a while.",1
"I loved the readings for this class and the paper assignments had a nice amount of freedom, often allowing students to choose between multiple readings. Feedback on papers was always extremely helpful and on point. Grading felt fair. Reading was manageable to light. Class discussions sadly got stale rather quickly and I wish there was more variety.",1
"Dr. Walling is a genius! I, honestly, do not know how CCP has been so lucky to keep him all these years. His knowledge on the world, through archeology and anthropology is astonishing! Every class I would go in like a sponge, ready to absorb everything he says! The man his so much to tell! Remarkable professor!",1
On the second day of class he asked me to throw something at him to let him know what time it was. I laughed then later found out he was serious and I now throw stuff every day. He is easily the best professor I have had at Penn State. His class is very interesting. He skips around the classroom (literally) and shows pretty sweet videos.,1
"I took him for CEE 202 and it was awful. He isn't very helpful, and doesn't post his notes online. The online website we used (WileyPlus) was a hot mess. His tests were also really hard if you've never taken a probability course before. Overall, a very bad experience.",0
"Ok wow I can't stand how she talks, so boring, and her online quizzes are pointless. Also, her whole participation grade is CRAP because its only if you show up or not. So if you're deathly ill for two weeks she'll give you a Zero... so basically you can show up and sleep in class and get a 20/20 she friggin sucks... i will never take her again",0
She is making students right now (during a pandemic) get a camera for the computer due to academic integrity issues. Some people have autoimmune diseases some have financial situations where they can't spend money on items like that. I think its fine enough to use lockdown browser but really a camera? I hope she realizes what she is doing is wrong.,0
"This teacher is a very confusing teacher. She talks around everything. She grades you on everything literally everything. The way you dress, the way you talk, how you stand. She makes up topics that don't apply to the real world. She makes you feel like your opinion doesn't matter. She's just horrible, I recommend that you take someone else.",0
"Friendly lady, not a great teacher. Don't get me wrong, if we were out of the classroom I would be her friend. She does not say what she means when it comes to the assignments. Make sure you are thorough on your on account. She will act like it's all good, but when it comes down to grading she will say something like...well want I wanted was this..",0
"Very vague with grading criteria. Not clear whatsoever with grading and assignments. As a person who has never enrolled in a geography course prior, I would not recommend this instructor. Sobie grades hard and does not hold himself to the same standard. What a joke! This school should look into just how terrible their online instructors truly are.",0
"Glenn Smith is, simply put, an angle of a man. Truly passionate about constitutional law, he genuinely cares about the education of each of his students. Participate in his class and he'll appreciate it. I am taking him in a course simulating the Supreme Court, smaller than his usual lectures, and he is very accommodating. Funny too!",1
One of my favorite professors in my online college experience. He encouraged out of the box ways of thinking while providing plenty of information to grasp what he expected of you. A fair grader that I would recommend taking. If he offered more classes I needed I would be taking him again.,1
"Dr. Callaway is a passionate, Knowledgable, and caring professor. Her lectures are incredibly interesting, and her class isn't too hard, but she grades papers and micro-themes toughly. She does however allow revisions on the papers, and gives really good feedback on it. She will make you want to continue classes in theology, even as a finance major",1
Assignments are mysterious. Grading is unfair. This professor is one of the worst I have ever had!,0
"she is the last person that needs to be in health care field. i missed the 1st day my son was in hospital and she informed me she didnt care and refused to tell me what i missed then brought it up in her lecture as an ""example or hypothetical situation"" critical condescending, its all about her and her life NEVER take her class",0
"Horrible professor. He was never in class due to countless excuses.  Word is he's an ****, and it shows in his horrible teaching methods.",0
"Coop is a nice guy, but definitely the worst professor I have had. I currently have him for physics. It is not worth coming to class as he just rambles on and writes so small on the projector that it is impossible to read. I have never learned so little in a class. It's much more beneficial to spend class time studying on your own or with a tutor.",0
"I loved this class and this professor is so sweet! The actual nicest guy ever, always is down to help others when needed. Due to covid, the class was asynchronous, so if you do decide to take this class make sure you watch the lectures and listen to the music he gives in order to do well on the tests! Highly recommend taking this class!!!!",1
"Syllabus is very clear, keep up with each weeks modules, quizzes are fairly easy, exams come from the quizzes and chapters, most of the questions can be found on quizlet. Fair grader, would recommend. I took the 8wk class and worked ahead finished all of the assignments in half the time.",1
"This class was way more difficult than it needed to be. The quizzes were 10% each and had over 50 vocab words and 10 listening examples to memorize for 20 Q's. Reading ""requirments"" came from an $85 online textbook that students hardly used. Lectures were material heavy and dry and slides were not posted after or before lecture if you missed class",0
"Ms. Wright is um mediocre. Her class isnt hard, if you show up youll pass (and if u dont show up youll probably still pass). Not too much hw. Her tests/finals are straightforward. She relies on the class to do a lot of the talking, so idk what she knows. Class kinda drags on , I took notes to stay awake.",0
Professor Cochrane is one of the best professors I've ever had. She's extremely nice and truly cares about her students. Her lectures are fairly interesting and her class overall is easy. There are some short in class writings and quizzes but if you miss them she lets you make them up. I would highly suggest you take a class with her if you can.,1
"Dr. Michael is the absolute GOAT. Dude is super cool and has tons of real world applicable examples and case studies. Will make you work hard, but is definately worth it. Tests are straightforward, and if you make a good formula sheet and put the problems he says will be on the test on there, you will get atleast a B. BEST ME PROF AT GANNON!!!!",1
"Her exam questions were more comprehensive. Her lectures contained a relatively dense amount of material. However, she missed her first couple of lectures since she misunderstood the syllabus. She uploaded an asynchronous lecture the night before reading week ended. Told everyone the final was non-cumulative when it was cumulative. Unreliable.",0
"Extremely disappointed and upset with Cyntha's teaching/behaviour this term. Questions on tests are misleading, marking schemes are strict, and do not follow the nature of the question asked. Rude on class forums, over email, and in person. Extremely unprofessional, and makes people feel degraded with how sarcastic, unhelpful, and mean she is.",0
"I understand that there are professors that give pop quizzes, but this specific professor takes off points for the little things & that really affects your quiz grades and also test grades. You would need to study really hard for this class or you will not pass. Many people have failed her class last semester. Be ready to study hard if you want it.",0
"This course was useless. The only useful thing I learned was how to write grant applications. Dean was a boring professor who only talked about his area of expertise.... FORESTRY! He has a lot of experience working abroad in natural resource development, but is not interesting at all.",0
"The amount he expects you to read is unrealistic, impossible, and actually humorous. He is obsessed with reading competency, very odd . He sends a 3 page letter explaining why he is such a hard grader. I am bummed hes the only on I could take for this course. Awful..",0
"He doesn't exactly know what he is doing I feel like.  He is an easy grader, even gives you partial credit on multiple choice.  so if you want to BS your way through a B, then this is a great class.  But everything is from the book, I didn't learn anything from his lectures.  He doesn't communicate what he wants to teach very well.  Hes a nice guy",0
"Do NOT take this class with this professor!!! She is a tough grader and can come off very rude when you have questions. I would go above and beyond, completed all of my work on time and always received zeros. Best advise I could give other students is to find another professor to take BIO with. I never write reviews but I had to warn you guys!",0
Fantastic lecturer! A crucial course if you have any intention of conducting your own research and Dr. McDonald makes the material easy to understand and adds humor into the mix to keep the class engaged.,1

"Mrs. Peters is a well organized teacher and is always prepared for class but her teaching methods are horrible. She teaches everything the long way. Alot of our class had issues with her method of teaching. Not very helpful when a question is asked, always gives general answers. Very sarcastic attitude. Not very helpful. Would not recommend her!",0
"Maiocco. (or Maureen) is a very organized professor. There is no excuse for any late deadlines,because she gives you PLENTY of warning(first day) No reason not to Ace class unless you're unintrested and or lazy.I graduated her from her degree program.",1
Gets in your face a lot. Treats you as if you're still in Middle School. I wouldn't recommend her class at all. Less than half of the class stayed for her class before I left.,0
"Extremely unorganized. I dont appreciate that she does not set any due dates and grades almost everything the weekend before finals week, not to mention that there is no final exam to boost your grade. She needs to restructure herself before students should consider taking her.",0
"Pretty good.  Somewhat ignorant of special education.  Sometimes a hard grader and inflexible.  But is enthusiastic, lots of great info., and learned a lot.  May be repeat of ENG 308 for some.",1
"There's no structure to her class. Classes are like coffee shop, feminist book discussions. There's nothing probing your thoughts. It really just feels like I was part of a big book club. If that's your thing go for it.",0
"I've never written a review but I have to for him. He is by far the worst professor I've ever had. Rude, doesn't help students, and consistently insults and makes you feel terrible if you don't know the answer. He said that if you need help to ask questions and when you do he insults you and tells you that you aren't studying enough. Don't take! ",0
This subject could be decent if taught by the right person. She's not it. Lectures didn't correlate with anything and we all seldom scored above C-range on tests. She cancelled our final the day before without explanation  which shattered my chances at bringing my grade up. She then refused to let me do anything else to help my grade. Steer clear.,0
He is very willing to help and trys very hard to make the material easy to understand but sometimes he ends up making things more confusing. ,1
"Dr. Holmes was the BEST professor I had at HCC! I had him for Human Anatomy and Physiology, and although the class and material are difficult, he made it fun and entertaining with ""Llama  Time"" every day during lecture. Definitely tries to relate all of the information we are learning to everyday things. I highly recommend taking classes with him.",1
She's excellent & dedicated.  A real purist and a joy to be in class with!,1
Be ready to watch a lot of Youtube Accounting videos.,0
This course is a complete waste of money and time. This guy has no idea what hes doing hes terrible. Professor Thompson does nothing more than read off The overhead projector its obvious he has no idea what the cost is about. Long boring lectures that have nothing to do with what youre going to be tested on sad so very sad. Take another class,0
Doesn't know what he's doing. Disorganized for every class,0
"She is tough! I took her for Anatomy and Micro and enjoyed the experience. People aren't used to having a confident, strong willed woman teaching so it can be hard to get used to. I'm still not sure if I'm prepared for it myself and I've known her for two year haha. She loves what she does and it shows in her work ethic. I'll miss you Mrs Elizondo.",1
"Very rude, very condescending, help was nonexistent. He did nothing to actually help his students. Threw a tantrum in the beginning of the semester and cancelled class because we werent asking enough questions. Very unprofessional. If I could give zeros, I would.",0
Loved the experience in class. Just wished for more trans exposure and centered narratives.,1
"He's a nutty professor, but attendance isn't mandatory and we just watch movies all period. Its an easy A.",1
"Not the worst professor I've ever had, but definitely not the best either. The lectures are very boring and dry. The quizzes and tests are over so many chapters that is makes it hard to study, but he does give hints if you attend the class. If you skip, there is almost no hope. Tax is a complex subject to understand, so it takes a lot of work.",0
"She is very boring, has surprise quizzes so you have to come to lecture, and is very unhelpful.  Quizzes and tests suck.",0
"Uses Matlab to avoid teaching. Super nice and has a lot of talk but cannot explain the topics. I think she is still faking it till she can make it. I had to retake course on transfer. Stay away. I don't understand why she was hired, they clearly did not ask students their thoughts.",0
"Not my favorite English professor here. Her exams are nearly irrelevant with remembering dates that books were written and petty chosen quote IDs that were completely irrelevant to the book themes. Rarely discusses the reading, heavily philosophy based. She could use  improvement.",1
"All the assignments were focused on recording interviews. I wish there was more variety in the learning material; the class is about new media, so there's plenty you can learn! Although he is not clear on any of the assignments (but expects you to know exactly what he's talking about), at least he is willing to help out and answer any questions.",1
"I enjoyed her lectures mostly because she has a sense of humor. There are two group projects (one audio and one live presentation), once a week hybrid assignments, and five exams (fairly easy). There are a lot of extra credit opportunities. Her class is an easy A if you do the work which is really easy. I would definitely take her again.",1
"Professor Gonzalez is a helpful and comforting professor who teaches his students in a fun and interesting manner. Throughout my time in his class, I and the rest of my classmates were laughing and learning. He presents the information in a simple way and allows us more than enough time to write each of our papers. Could not recommend him enough.",1
"Picks hard & confusing books to read and assigns reading due EVERY class. Papers are also confusing, midterm not too bad. She is a nice person but she makes the class difficult.",0
So Not sure if it is because we had to switch to online but this class was unnecessarily difficult. The test averages were around 65 to 50. The tests were timed which was a huge issues it felt rushed and like you didn't have time to go over your answers. On top of that it's a lot of material over short periods of time.,0
"Suck it up! For those of you who said he's too hard, what were you expecting, someone to hold your hand, spoon-feed you and then help you hang your degree?!While Professor Taylor holds high expectations for his students he is one of the most understanding and helpful profs at this school.",1
"Professor Monahan is the beginning, then end, the one who is many. He is Monahan. I transferred into Suffolk from SUNY Cortland, and he is the best professor I have ever had to date. Monahan Cares about every one of his students, and is always there when you need some advice. Overall, excellent professor, And will be continued in mgmt. :)",1
He sucks. He puts his religious beliefs on his test and just sucks a lot.,0
No Comments,1
She's very kind but not the best at teaching. Her lectures areong and tedious. She expects you to be an expert after a long powerpoint lecture and rambles when she lectures.,0
"Love this teacher! He was so awesome made the class very enjoyable. I felt like I never wanted to miss a class. My advice to you is don't miss class because you will miss a lot. This class is not easy for people who don't understand logic like myself, but I sure did learn a lot from this teacher. He's always willing to help whenever your stuck. ;)",1
"This teacher is nice, but is not a good teacher. Doesnt seem like anybody in the class is doing well, pretty bad when the class avg on tests is a 42%...take another teacher if you want to pass",0
You need to go to class. You can guarantee that you'll learn a lot from her class. Her office hours are helpful. Definitely learned a lot from her.,1
"I enjoy learning from Hansen. He clearly loves what he does, and although he can be slow at returning papers, you would be hard pressed to find an instructor more engaging or intelligent. Smartest person I know, not just in his field but in general. Easy to talk to, always willing to help his students. Highly recommended.",1

"So awful. Worst professor you will have at UCONN. Her class should be for philosophy majors only, and philosophy IV or something. She grades everything so tough and if you complain to her via email she basically doesnt do anything to fix it. Take this class and youll want to die! If you have this class in your cart delete it before it is too late",0
"beckett was challenging and frustrating (maybe even useless), but hansen was a lot of fun. fair grader, workload was average, down to earth and accessible.",1
"This is a good choice if you have responsibilities outside of school, attendance is not mandatory and slides from lectures are posted online so studying can be done from home. Professor Law is a kind individual who is passionate about philosophy and cares about his students. My one complaint; he speaks quietly and is hard to hear sometimes",1
This she has a thick accent that is very hard to understand. The way the book teaches the material is how she teaches it. The equation / algebraic expressions are literally on one slide. So there is barely room to understand what is going on. The fact that she only grades quizzes and test will make it harder to pass this class. Do not recommend.,0
"This class was incredible. She really prioritizes thinking like a scientist and wants you to enjoy lab every week, and tries to keep the workload manageable. Lots of feedback is given for all assignments and she checks in with the class regularly to make sure everyone's doing well. Extremely available outside of class too!",1
"Terrible professor. Very difficult tests and quizees which the class is not properly prepared for. Most people in class recieved low grades in the C range. The MOST BORING teacher i have ever had, he talks in a monotone voice. Very inconsiderate with his grading.Recieved a bogus participation grade DNT TAKE. One of the worst teachers ive ever had.",0
AWESOME!! He makes class interesting and makes sure everyone gets a good grade. He also brings treats almost every Friday. His stories are hilarious and you can tell that he is super intelligent and passionate about his work.,1
"DO NOT TAKE HER IF YOU WANT TO LEARN. She is super nice but when it comes to teaching, she is no help at all. Not a very hard grader on the lab reports because she does not teach anything. Lab protocols are a mess and have a lot of typos and she leaves you to deal with that by yourself. No point in asking her a question because she does not answer.",0
"For my class he had a tendency to go over the class time by a few minutes, so that was frustrating but overall he really cares about what he's teaching and has lots of good stories",1
"A very nice woman with very rigid grading. However, she is a very good teacher and if you go to her office she'll help you as much as she can. Just watch out for the homework assignments. They take up a ton of time, and she only picks 2 problems to grade so you can get unlucky and have the one problem you got wrong picked.",1
The class is very irrelavent to English and Literature and the professor also uses biases in his teachings and towards students. The class is very boring.,0
"Prior exp recommended, not req'd f/program-- maybe it should be due to lab. Go fig, 3 labs & they R never ""open"", false advertising. BTW, 10 peeps failed the catheter 1st time, it's a program issue. I have gone above & beyond what is req'd class wise. When I was looking into exp COC called. At least I got away from YOU! Why do ya care A.F.?",1
"I love Professor Lusk! While her classes tend to be pretty lecture heavy, I generally don't get bored listening to her. Her lectures are honestly quite thought provoking and interesting. She tells stories that make her lessons pretty applicable. Don't skip her class, I relied a lot on what I learned in class for tests. Also she grades pretty easy.",1
"I was extremely dissatisfied with this course and I am disappointed because I was looking forward to the material (St. Francis). I would not take a course with this professor again. He is intelligent, but lacks the social skills to maintain a proper classroom environment. It felt like a dysfunctional family; I dreaded going to class each day.",0
"Worst professor I have taken till date. Very boring lectures, feel like they never end. Very unfair grader. Please save yourself by taking another prof for 1700.",0
She teaches  like she thinks that history is your only class you are taking.  The readings for each class are at least 30 pages long and you have to know all about it. She gives you what is gonna be on the midterm but there are about 53 terms and 4 essays to define. She narrows it down but it is too difficult. Dont take her or you will regret it.,0
"Professor Blair is a very excellent professor! I took her English 1A online class during summer intersession, and I received an A. Honestly because this class is English 1A, it involves a lot of reading and essay writing. She grades her student's work fairly; that is why passing her class depends on your class performance. I recommend her!",1
"Professor Todd truly cares about his students, and he can be very lenient with deadlines and due dates. The class is more beneficial if you participate about the novels you are reading, and I enjoyed how passionate he was about what he taught. I recommend him for any English class.",1
"I literally taught myself this class, no joke. I studied and read the textbook for HOURS daily and watched youtube videos. There might as well have not been a professor teaching the class, she reads the powerpoint slides in a monotoned voice, does not really teach. 3/4 of my class dropped and I was one of maybe a few to pass. Do not take her class.",0
Professor Bogdan is one of the best Criminal Justice Professors out there. It will listen to everything you have to say and he is very understanding. If you ever have a question you can go to his office even during is NON office hours and he will always help ! LOVE LOVE LOVE HIM!,1
"Loved this teacher. Very helpful, very thoughtful, and all around wonderful teacher. Highly recommend Mrs. Van Horn's class. Great Teacher!!",1
Easiest class I've ever taken. 3 test and weekly assignment that could be done under 20 minutes ,1
the average class grade on his exams is ALWAYS failing and he advertises a 20 point curve in his syllabus. The fact that he HAS to give a 20 point curve should tell MTSU that he can't teach and no one learns anything. Avoid this professor.,0
"Very wonderful teacher and person. Firm, but fair! I adore her!!!",1
"her first test you are going to fail it, the rest of the tests are a breeze, i hated her class but now i love it!",1
"Matt does a great job keeping class interesting, despite the sometimes dull subject matter. I have really enjoyed learning from him and hearing his own personal experience. Definitely would recommend the class for a 150 gen ed.",1
It was an easy A and only had 2 tests and research paper that I got a 100 on because I do not think she even read it. She does take attendance every class. I did not learn that much and was able to do my other work during that class. Do not take her class if you actually want to learn about child and adolescent development.,0
"She is very unclear and doesn't get to the point most of the time when she's talking about topics, she takes forever to grade basically anything, she was absent for every exam so if you had any questions on a test question you were basically SOL. Also she changed the syllabus 5 or 6 times throughout the year so good luck planning out anything.",0
The best,1
"O.k. classes, has her own favorites though.",1
"There is one test which is about 25 questions, all multiple choice, but he gives you a study guide of 50 questions all multiple choice. Try to write all questions on notecards and he may let you use on test if you ask. Weekly journals that he'll grade at the end. One project about your topic of choice as long as someone else doesn't pick it. Love",1
"Professor Kubota has a great sense of humor and is always great fun in the classroom. However, she does get right to work and makes sure that the class learns what they need to during the lesson. Towards the end of this course it does get really fast-paced and difficult. But that has more to do with the material not really professor Kubota's fault.",1
"I think she's the worst teacher at the J School for first-year students. I know she has good reviews for her upper-level courses, but it didn't go well when I had her for a 100-level class. She expects you to know things you haven't been taught yet. Her tests are also pretty difficult because she focuses on very obscure sections of the textbook.",0
"He always picks the hardest things to do a paper on. Can we ever get a topic that does not deal with plato. PLEASE grade easier on the papers, and exams, have some mercy on the grades. And try to rethink a grade sometimes. That would be very, very nice to do for a person.",1
"I won't lie: professor Lowi is a pretty hard grader, and she gives a large amount of reading.  Nevertheless, she is extremely smart, and knows a ton about politics.  Also, she really is a nice person.  All in all, her class is quite challenging, but I enjoy it and am learning alot from it.",1
"Great professor and the least stressful language class out there. It is still sort of hard though since it's Japanese, but she makes it easier than even some of the lower level professors do.",1
Show up to class and do your homework,1
"Organic chem will ALWAYS be hard, so i cant 100% blame her for my experience, but she only grades based off of tests and a couple quizzes. Exams are worth 90%. Its stressful and shes difficult to learn from because of the accent, i would highly recommend buying the textbook to support learning, it helped my grade a lot.",1
"This guy is terrible. I'm a ME major, this course is needed, and I have never gotten below a 84 in any previous math class. Makovers handwriting is bad, he jumps all over the place, he'll change numbers in examples or put an equation into mathmatica if he can't figure it out, and he goes way to fast. Avoid him at all costs.",0
"Would not recommend at all. She's a tough grader. Literally so disrespectful, she shamed someone in front of the whole class because they didn't do their homework. She expects you to like and be good at music, regardless of major. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Has weekly quizzes but they're fairly straight forward if you pay attention in class. Lectures had a lot of content, but exams were easier than expected. All of his classes have group projects (that I've taken at least). Old school teaching style, but very nice guy outside of class. Also none of his classes use textbooks.",1
Unexpectedly strict,1
"tough marker, hand still hurts from writing the 20 page final.",1
"Dr. Starner is one of the BEST teachers I have ever had.  He is helpful, caring, and knowledgable.",1
"So Luttrell is a nice old man. He has become the butt of most of our jokes though. He would be great teaching toxicology I'm sure, but O Chem is definitely not his strong suit. However, he is the only O Chem professor at OC. Just READ the book, get labs and homework done (easy grades), and good luck learning.",0
"She really is a sweet lady, but not the best teacher. Honestly could not learn one thing during class. Frequently went to her office hours which was SOMETIMES helpful but still did so poorly on exams and will probably fail the final. She scales the course and wants her students to do well, but doesn't go about it the right way.",0
"AMAZING PROFESSOR! such good lectures, you will learn so much. Generally there is no extracredit, but due to COVID she was understanding when we went online. STUDYSTUDYSTUDY. She is very friendly and easy to talk to as well. Kind of neurotic in the best way. There are only 4 grades. 3 exams and homework each worth 25%. I suggest her you wont regret",1
Cindy Angel is great professor. He class is a night class so it's 3 hours long. The lectures are very boring but she is a super nice professor.,1
"Like other negative reviews, he does give pop quizzes and is a bit rude, however Lab class is Lab and his lecture doesn't really matter as you need to memorize the lab lists and models for the exams. Hes pretty much there for any extra info you need but 99% of Lab is just memorizing the lists and models",0
"Is way too personal in lectures, treats us as if shes at the psychologist. Gives extra credit but you have to pay $15 for the app. 3 exams are 75% of grade and homework (that she says helps pay her bills) is 25%. Would not take again but it is an easy class if you prefer a teacher who gives out way too much personal information.",0
"Easy class, she does space out your essays which is really helpful but overall extremely boring lectures and you can't doing anything else but bare through the monotone for an hour and a half, would not recommend this teacher.",0
"Hands down the best professor I have ever had. Not only did he answer every question I had, he has a great sense of humor and really gets to know his students. As long as you show up and do the homework, the class is a breeze.",1
For some reason I really like Dr. Self. his lectures are a little disorganized but as long as you record what he says and complete the study guides you should get an A on the exam. the only problem are the written questions because the specific TA I had was a super tough grader.,1
"I don't understand the tough grading on here. My experience with Dr. Meche is great because I do all the assigned reading. He does, however, ask that the students really read the material and post six separate discussion posts. (at minimum 200 words a pop). I think he just wants us to actually get something out of the class. Clear on criteria!",1
"McGee is a great instructor! Quizzes once a week over lecture notes, easy as long as you study some.  A total of 4 tests and then the final.  She is keeps you entertained during her lectures so you aren't falling asleep! Just study and pay attention, you'll be golden.  One of the best instructors by far.  Take her!",1
"If you want to learn more about Engineering, don't take him. If you want to get an easy A, don't take him either.",0
"She is the worst. I cant belive that anyone has actually said that they have liked her on here. This class sucks. She makes you feel dumb. You have a new paper to do probably every week. Her assignments are never clear and shes confusing. Shes also a nut. Save yourself, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!",0
"She does not use her lecture time very well. She spends a long time on a particular topic, then has to hurry and cover other material in a very short period of time. Takes points for attendance in lecture and discussion sessions once a week. Overall a nice teacher, but I felt she made an entry level Biology course incredibly too hard.",0
Very nice and caring teacher and person. She will go out of her way to help you with personal problems or school problems. NUMBER 1.,1
"The best part of this class is when it's over. This class is almost too fun. He uses puppets, imaginary competitive juggling, log throwing, and mustache growing to show how invisible neutrinos are the real cause of his headaches. He also once arm wrestled a bear to raise funds for cancer. He is truly too good to be a chem 101 teacher.",0
"all he talks about is God, he relates everything to God, and it's not  bible class, very annoying when it comes to cell phone, completely felt like a elementary school teacher, and he never shuts up, let us watch the movie, he stops it and just analyses sayy to much.",1
Impossible to follow. You can never be sure exactly what it is she wants from you in class or on assignments. Didn't seem to have fundamental knowledge of what she was teaching. Couldn't give clear answers to questions.,0
"I learned a lot and worked hard, but my grade did not reflect my efforts. The highest grade on assignments/exams is usually a B. Average grade is barely passing. You will learn a lot in her class, but at the cost of your GPA; no matter how hard you work.",0
"I had Professor Steiner in my first semester of college (Fall 2019.) She has by far been the BEST math teacher or professor I've had this far. She is available all the time, being in her class you can truly tell that she genuinely wants her students to learn and succeed. I actually miss going to her class. I'm confident in my math skills now.",1
Will is a great professor. He made programming really easy to understand and is lightyears better than most of the other IT professors. Definitely recommend his classes.,1
"Ms. Lewis is NOT a good teacher. NO test reviews, NOT even for Finals!! Practice Test on my math lab for the final were not reflective of her final exam. Very Tough Grader, no room for error on Any exams! BEWARE... classes start out full most will drop! Studied my tail off, A student, enjoy a challenge but Something was off here!!",0
"Shes terrible. She talks in circles and barely makes any sense. She takes attendance every class so you have to go but you don't learn a single thing. She is extremely unclear about everything yet expects you to know what she is talking about, when a lot of times it seems like she doesn't know what shes talking about. Never take her classes.",0
"She is an amazing prof! puts all slideshows and video recordings on moodle! If you want to do good in psych, pick her as your prof! :)",1
Clear about grading and assignments. Followed the syllabus throughout the semester so it was easy to keep track of what we were going to be doing in class. Keeps the lectures interesting and offers extra credit but isn't the best at responding to emails. Also doesn't post grades on D2L so it can be difficult to keep track of your exact grade.,1
"LOVED Mrs. Calkins. She is very sweet and caring, and she does a great job of structuring the course and making it easy for students to do well. She really cares about her students. She is a tough grader, and she expects a lot from her students, but she has detailed assignment descriptions and rubrics so you know exactly what she's looking for.",1
"Had her as a TA. Was not enthusiastic, constantly has an attitude, and is not helpful. Seems to want to get through the lab as quick as possible, and has high expectations for students that she can't live up to herself.",0
"I took professor Schnell's high school accelerated class and I actually miss it sometimes, that's how well she taught it. I had no idea how to write one of the essays but she helped me through it and it turned out really well! Kinda makes me wish I was an English major.",1
"Professor Ratner's class is beyond dull. He stands in front of the class and reads off the slides the entire lecture. 3 exams and 1 project. No room for error. His ""curves"" are points reimbursed for mistakes that he made on the exam. He's also pretty inconsiderate, he doesn't care about your situation unless you provide hard proof. Dont recommend.",0
"Great speaker. Encourages participation and has 3 group assignments. Choose group wisely - they are with you all semester. Make sure to take notes during class reading assignments (Jager, Clear Blue, ect) because they are used on the exam. Easy professor to talk to and ask for help. Bonus - he is pretty cute and has an awesome German accent.",1
avoid at all cost.,0
"Although personally I liked him, and I thought that he was super passionate about science, a lot of times I felt like he couldn't properly explain concepts to us. Nice guy, but I'm not sure I'd take him again unless I have to. ",0
"Had us read 20 pages of a statistic book every week, and asked us 3 random questions regarding chapter. On top of that was having us research, write draft, and final within 3 weeks and didn't offer much help regarding the papers. Also wouldn't grade my finished work over the spring break because one of my sources couldn't be printed.",0
She's a nice lady but at time is very bossy and wants things to get done ver her she really cares about her students and especially puente becareful though she would try to convince you to take a bunch of units for one semester,1
"You have to teach yourself and do homework before class THEN he'll go over the homework and kind of lectureteach.  The class bore me to tears and honestly can't say that I learned and retained anything that was ""taught"" in class.  I need to retake the class and saw that he was teaching again... Yeah. I'm heading to another campus.  ",0
Had Dr. Jennings for several graduate courses. His wealth of knowledge is unbelievable.I learned more from him than any other professor I've had for over 240 credits of college course work.,1
"Worst professor I've ever taken ever in my history of math professors. She is an introvert, which I did take into factor, but she cannot teach the subject whatsoever. Skims through the guided notes, if she doesn't like a part of the notes she skips it and her tests are worded so you cant understand them. Don't take unless you want to teach urself.",0
"i cant stand her! worst professor ever, i would NOT recommend! she pics a few ""favorites"" but stay away from her! your GPA will thank you!",0
Among other half-witted professors this one likes to randomly add passwords to quizzes for no reason other than to make your life harder because it's easy to use someone else's work and throw your name at the top. Her videos aren't helpful and she depends on course simulations to teach because there's clearly a lack of experience on her part.,0
"She is ready to help you succeed if you go to her for help. Always accessible through email or office hours. There are 4 papers, 2 quizzes, participation and 2 exams that make up grade. Gives out exam questions 2 weeks before the exam date, then will go over them as a review session. If you show you're working hard, she gives a good grade.",1
"Too much reading, I do not learn my reading 30 pages of information and then taking 4 different tests on it. I will NEVER take this class again. I just had a mental breakdown over this class and I'm over it.",0
"Boyer's cool and his Cisc 101 class is extremely easy. Its just that he's a total bum. Oh and if you need to email him about something, don't bother! He won't respond back. He's virtually useless. And it's weird that a man who teaches CISC has to stare at the keyboard and types only with his pointer fingers",0
"A fairly good amount of work for class (lots of writing inside the lab and on your own). Nan makes you work for your grade, but she knows her stuff. Very funny also. Do not skip class! Bring quality level drafts to progress meetings and save yourself in the long run. No textbook required",1
"The content of the class is not difficult. However, instead of teaching the basic concepts, he mostly uses his example problems and goes off on useless tangents, which only leads to class confusion, which leads to wasting time answering questions trying to justify himself. He never uses the book, but to get an A, I'd recommend reading it.",0
"LOVED Jeanette-nice, caring, overall awsome teacher!!",1
No Comments,0
"He seems like a very nice guy, but that truly does not outweigh the insane amount of classwork he gives each week. He is also completely inaccessible outside the classroom, and will take off 1% point from your final grade if you email him something that could be discussed at office hours. PSU offers a variety of ECON courses, TAKE ANOTHER ONE.",0
"Erika Lytle is the best teacher at ABtech hands down. She is kind, intelligent, and funny. She cultivates an environment for people with differing opinions to learn about each other as people. Not only is she a brilliant teacher, she is a genuinely good person. Public speaking can be daunting, but if you have a chance to take it with Lytle, do it.",1
"Professor Zuidervaart is a really great professor. There is mandatory class attendance every week. Her workload is pretty average and she gives you a couple of days to complete it. She has three big papers which includes small assignments to help keep you on track. Overall, if you stay proficient in her class you will get a good grade.",1
"The material itself is fun and I learned a lot from it. Theres no denying hes knowledgable and creative. This being said, I think he lacks a lot of empathy for his students and can be condescending or rude towards them. If you are stressed or struggling, he wont be very helpful. If not, youll probably enjoy the class and do fine",0
she hardly helped with any questions I asked over email. Her powerpoint lectures don't really help with the tests because she asks tough detailed questions from it. Her assignments are pretty straight forward but her interaction with students is poor so you have to be good with teaching yourself the material given,0
"Waxler is a very smart man and gives good lectures, but that's it. He is very old fashioned in his teaching style and doesn't really engage with anyone in class. I went to ask for help with him once and it felt like an interrogation. Make sure you don't get sick or miss a class ever.",0
"I would not take Liya for an upper division course. She doesn't really explain key topics clearly. Many times she'll just read from the lecture slides, and it seems as if she doesn't really know the information. Also, the book goes into great detail for certain topics, that are very complicated, but she'll hardly explain them class.",0
"I work a full time job, and couldn't attend his surprise weekly video-discussions. He said it was a ""shame"" I couldn't skip two hours of work to join and get help. Discussions not recorded. COVID-work related issues caused me to miss a test. No exceptions allowed. Couldn't get help on homework problems unless I knew answers. Tutors were clueless.",0
Very difficult lab instructor. She's a really nice person but will rip you a new one when it comes to grading. She will take off points for any little thing and before you know it you have a terrible grade on lab reports. She always seemed annoyed when you asked her questions during lab so take her at your own risk,0
"The best professor that I have had at Rutgers. The best. Super friendly, easy to talk to, always open to personal help outside. He's understanding about any individual problem you may have...always takes your opinions seriously. Above all a great person. Take his class.",1
Wouldnt have passed w/o my smart boyfriend. Lectures are just him making something complicated when it is simple & he only lectured once or twice a week. I hardly attended class. Only days of quizzes/exams. Gives many assignments that are tedious & not helpful. You are better off getting tutored at the learning center than going to his class.,0
TERRIBLE AVOID AT ALL COST!!!,0
AVOID THIS CLASS. He honestly gives so much homework and expects you to follow his answers word for word. He makes you read the chapter in the book and then you are allowed to revive lecture videos afterwards which I think is ridiculous. This is honestly the worst class Ive taken and I regret doing it online as well.,0
"IDK why she's a professor to start off. She Can Not Teach!! If you ask her a question she is unable to answer because she doesn't know herself. Take my advice and avoid her at all cost or you will regret it. She also teaches Auditing, do yourself a favor and do not take her!",0
"I have taken about 6 classes with Professor Graham. While the material assigned is somewhat time consuming, the lectures are straightforward and Professor Graham is very good at responding to emails and providing help. I feel like he cares about his students and I'm sad that this is my last math class as I'd gladly take him again.",1
i called him professor fidel nicastro all semester.  the online homework is terrible.  a lot of memorization cause he doesnt give you the equations you actually need.  huge curve at the end becuase everyone fails.  he gets really pissed off if the class doesnt answer questions so just hope theres someone who knows what they are doing.,0
"Short papers, blogs and a 4-5 part final paper.  At least 2 of these are due every week.  She's not clear on answers. Open book tests but she takes so many points off for everything else that it doesn't matter. Expects very detailed everything but never gives an example of what she wants and you lose an incredible amount of points for it. ",0
"She doesn't know how to explain her assignments correctly. She expects her students to only work on her assignments and forgets we have other classes to work on. She also doesn't grade her assignments until the very end, so you will never know where you stand. Drop this class if you can.",0
Music Theory: he's great. Will clearly explain things & make sure you understand. We do lot's of practice before the test. Aural Skills: sooooo slow. He will NOT challenge you. Take him if you struggle with aural. Do not take him if you're good and wanna be pushed because you will fall behind. He's a lovely person though.,1
"Professor Hahn is all around very good. She has an accent which can make things difficult to understand at times but she tries very hard/is very enthusiastic. She is hilarious, kind and very personable. Some times she moves a little fast, but that is to be expected with the amount of material.",1
I actually really liked this professor. PAY ATTENTION TO ONLINE HOMEWORK AND SLIDES FROM LECTURE WHEN STUDYING FOR TESTS!,1
Love this class. Tests is multiple choice  and they're easy if you study only! He truly cares about his students and wants you to learn. Definitely recommend him.,1
"she rocks! show up, take notes, she tells you what is on the tests, do the 3 papers and do the final, EASY PASS AND UNITS!!!!!!",1
"The course pack was abysmal, it had incomplete texts and pages that were incomplete as a sticky-note was left on the page. The majority of the semester was spent listening to presentations of a high school level on artists and art movement or a philosophy. Where was the teaching?! Oh that's right, we watched movies on the Greek & Romans & a church.",0
"The WORST Math teacher I have ever had. Highly not recommended if you want to pass the class and not destroy your GPA. Do not answer questions clearly. I felt like a prealgebra student in a Calculus class, will take points off if you skip steps that you are supposed to master. Also, imposes you how to write ( printed and not cursive).",0
"THE MOST HORRIBLE CLASS EVER TOOK. He's really boring and doesn't help you on the quizzes, and makes you do a  useless group projects. He reads off the power points. He doesn't use  Canvas to grade the work, but it is through SAM.  Answers from the quizzes are not from the book so wouldn't recommend to read the book look it up from a different sour",0
"Made me believe I could and what do you know, I did.  I passed this course after struggling with math for so long.  She made it easy to learn the material and everyone is comfortable with her in class.",1
"If you want to devote your life to math while taking her class, then take her! but otherwise, i would stay away. i was good at algebra and math until i got into her class, she expected her students to go to the homework hotspot everyday if they didnt understand something. Shes a smart person but does not know how to teach. I regret not dropping.",0
"Don't understand how he can be rated below a 5 for easiness. A 75% is an A, and I got a 95 doing minim work. Just go to class and sleep and hit 2 clicker buttons and you'll get an A",1
"Professor's reading assignments mostly consist of his own writings that summarize thinkers like Hegel, Locke, etc. in a few short paragraphs -- so this course doesn't really teach you about sociology or how to critically analyze texts, just parrot back his own ideas of who these people are. Seems very self-indulgent.",0
"doesn't answer emails and her rubrics are very vague, pointless, and don't make sense",0
"Craig Meixsell was tough to deal with. He did not know the new department system, had poor time management, dreadful lectures, and graded very harshly in a ""his word is law"" manner.  If you know little about computers, take another professor.  That being said, you can pass with a high grade, but it is solely up to you to do it.",0
"I tried to give him a chance throughout the year and not be mean on this website but he is  the worst professors i have taken my entire 3 years in college...... WAY to much work, unrealistic expectations for class, and in my opinion is your students are consistently failing your test and you have to cure them by 30 plus % then something is wrong!  ",0
"Hard to understand because English is not her first language, so she's unhelpful just because it's hard to know what she's saying. If you've had a lot of art instruction in high school, she probably won't teach you a thing - your best bet is to submit a portfolio and try to place out of 1005 altogether.",0
Impossible to understand. Rambles incoherently at times. Just read his slides and sign the attendance sheet and you'll be fine. Bring something to do in class though.,0
This is the absolute worst class and professor I have ever taken. She is an unreasonably hard and inconsistent grader. Gives contradictory feedback and is rude and belittling in doing so. Her grading system is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. I should have dropped this class. STAY AWAY!!!,0
"I've taken Will's class from LFS250 to 350 and found myself lucky for not required to take LFS400. He is the most unaccessible teacher ever in my whole school life. No email response, and he's not willing to help students.",0
She clearly cares about her students but unfortunately does not meet the mark as a professor. She assigns readings and documentaries that are very long and complicated and blatantly boring. She puts thought into her lectures but unfortunately does not capture interest. She is also very set in her opinion and does not make room for other ones.,0
"VERY awesome and kind professor. He teaches well, teaches a lot but his exams are ALWAYS what's taught in the class. He reviewed every exam we took the day before the exam and including the final. Final was WAY too hard in my opinion but he will work with the class. If a test is too difficult he will eliminate one question or count as extra credit.",1
"he knows the subject well and teaches you things that you'll need in your career, but he is a little biased when it comes to design.  if your design is not how he thinks it should be, you kind of sense this negative vibe from him.",0
"She is truly invested in making he students succeed! I highly recommend her. She's kind, intelligent, and will help you when you need help! She uses power points that are helpful! She makes Chemistry fun! I enjoyed Chem 130 with her and plan on taking Chem 151 with her!",1
great teacher she makes the students feel comfortable in her class and she is a geat person to be around.,1
"So this class is pretty lecture heavy, if you are a solid note taker you will pass this class easily. We had a pop quiz on the third day of class, so write down pretty much everything he says. We also had HW on the second day of class, we had to read and answer 10 questions on Apology by Socrates (that was great). His shorthand sucks so make a key.",0
"He is an amazing professor. Very knowledgeable. I took Engl250 short semester with him and it wasn't pretty. Have to admit despite him being nice, his also a tough grader. Very strict when it comes to homework submission. He also has a sense of caring. I would only recommend to take his class if you are looking for a challenge. If not don't.",1
Great professor.  I learned a lot in this class.,1
"This is an easy class. Shes very passionate about her job but tries too hard to create friendly connections with her students. This can be a bit annoying at times as she goes on long tangents. This feels nothing short of a highschool English class. Get ready to pass, its hard not to.",0
A ridiculous amount of work each week. No communication with instructor whatsoever. Missed One deadline because it is a class where teacher doesnt email you for months and failed. I got an F whereas I had gotten an A on 2301 with a different professor.,0
"The professor is a nice, fair and great teacher. At times, he gets off subject here and there, but he is always on track.  He knows his subject.  No quizzes at all, only mid-term and final exams but you must study, study and study for those exams.  We do have class projects on case studies but it isn't hard.",1
"He's a good TA. Has a bit of an accent, but still easy to understand. You can ask him for help with the discussion worksheet so you should do fine in the course.",1
"Go to class, do the labs and practice the problem sets. Lectures based on the textbook but I've opened it less than 5 times and I'm not struggling. If you don't want to ask her questions, ask the lab instructor and you'll be fine.",1
"This professor was easily my favorite professor for the JOMC introductory classes. All of her lectures and usage of slides and notes are engaging and humorous, and overall she is a wonderful person. She responds to emails quickly, and the assistance she provides helps me feel welcomed. She wants her students to succeed - and love that. 10/10.",1
"As a teacher he will get an F. He does not motivate students to learn more, he does not how to teach, and he uses an obsolete system. Not a great teacher.",0
"Her exams are extremely difficult with no help from lectures. She's a tough grader and her assistants are even worse. she's VERY kind, very attractive, great personality etc but as a professor, she's a wolf in sheep's clothing. 100% AVOID.",0
His tests are very very hard. His lectures are extremely long and difficult to follow. He does not use powerpoint or anything for his lectures. It is also very difficult to keep a good grade in his class. Would not take him again.,0
"Delius really cares about urbanism and her class is very interesting. The readings can get super bland, especially since she basically just goes over them word for word in class, but the class itself is definitely easy if you put in an ounce of effort. You have one easy midterm, a few one page papers, a map project, and a research paper.",1
Awesome!!,1
She really isn't the nicest lady. Pretty rude as well. Leaves class mid lecture to take phone calls for what? I don't know. There are days where she's pleasant and then days where she's so nasty you can cut the tension with a knife. If you just go to class and do your best you'll be fine. It's just not a pleasant experience though.,0
Hands down one of the worst professors at the University of Hartford. He never responds to students asking for help and will take points off your grade for any stupid little thing. He is out to get students and if he doesn't have a good feeling about you from day one drop the class because you don't have a chance at passing.,0
"Excellent advisor, knowledgeable in the field of social work. slow on grading but will answer e-mails. Expect lots of homework and papers. he is courteous and respectul, patient and willing to advise you sincerely about the field.",1
"Loved him, took him for first year seminar, very laid back, wrote one essay the whole semester",1
"Brent is a great teacher. He must have a photographic memory. He can remember almost every movie, actor, and scene he has ever seen. You have two LARGE papers(FUN),and a group presentation (FUN.) We had three ""field trips"" to the movie theater. He bases his lectures on what the students want to learn. Great class.",1
"One of the best classes I've ever taken at UNT! I was in the accelerated 2040/2050 course and myself, professora and all the other students became like a big happy family, that worked really hard!! You must study, read, go to every class, get involved and work very hard. If you do all of these things, you will do very well. I already miss everyone!",1
AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!! I have NEVER had an online class with as many assignments due each week. If you take this professor you might as well quit your job if you want to pass. Professor also wants nothing to do with the students so good luck getting in touch with her. Also all tests require computer lock down and webcam.,0
Took Gene for a 3 hour course and it was hard to stay awake. His tests are straight from the lectures but very difficult. Hardest criminal justice teacher i've taken at UCF and i just completed my minor.,0
LA is what most professors should learn to be like. She is caring of her students and genuine. Her method of grading made it very easy to pass the class with weekly quizzes as opposed to a midterm. One short case analysis and final exam. Love her and her method of evaluation. Would take her class again!,1
For humanities she never ever lectured. The whole class was reading and then taking notes to present in a group discussion. We also watched documentaries that she herself had never even seen. When grading she was kind of unfair about it. I had an A in the class the whole time then with the last essay on the final she screwed me over with a B.,0
"You really have to learn it yourself. Plus, he will wait until the end of the semester to grade anything, so you have no idea where you stand in the class. However, he does curve. A lot. Big curves. Like where did that come from? Still a stressful class though.",0
"explanations are lacking and course content never goes deep into a topic. overall not interesting, but easy to pass. even though much reading is required.",0
"Dr. Kiesewetter is very organized, and gives good examples for students to study with. The only issue with her is that she WILL NOT scale. I took Chem 101 with her, and she would not scale anyone. She is very good with office hours, she's very nice and has great powerpoints, I would recommend her but get ready to work.",1
"Very rude and unhelpful via email, though I suppose that is because it is an online class and she does not want to be bothered with helping students. I sincerely hope that she isn't this unapproachable and rude to all of her classes.",0
"Professor Cupani is so sweet and I had her for the Chemistry lab and it was a breeze! She broke it down step by step,Had a video for us to watch if we didnt understand her so how could you not pass! But if you skip lab you will not pass! All you have to do is show up ,do your labs,put the labs in your lab manual and turn it in at the end",1
He has no remorse. Doesn't teach anything. He just pre-records lectures and makes you watch them on your own time. Every class you have a quiz first thing and then he asks you if you have any questions on the new topic you were suppose to watch for the week. Simply you have to teach yourself calculus 2 while he watches you struggle.,0
He is pretty tough but if you show up and seem like you are trying he will give you a decent grade. I did horrible on the labs but the sign in sheet got me a B- in the class.,0
If you can learn on your own I'd recommend her otherwise if you need a walk through of the information in order to learn find another professor.,0
"Potential students,Please take your preq.; know it well. has a power control issue. He will tell U up front, he always win. What ever you do do not challenge his authority, He will target U through out the course and make it very difficult for U.",0
His class average was a 49 till the last week. the entire semester I didnt have above a 76 till the last week of class and I had the highest grade.,0
"He is a tough grader. Expect papers, and group projects. He grades your participation, so if you don't speak up, you'll see it reflected on your grade. The text book is a must. He uses every second of class, so arrive on time. He is a nice guy, just a tough teacher to have.",1
This class was the most enjoyable in my opinion and I have been with DMACC for close to four years now! She was very responsive and understanding. The books she assigns are great in terms of history of humor seen through literature. She also adds a few video assignments as well! Tons of reading but it is to be expected for a literature course.,1
"She assigns way too much work. Her discussion boards and current events are fine, but her worksheets are awful. Even with the textbook it's hard to find the right answers because she changes the wording and makes the questions confusing. I will be getting an A in this class, but it was not easy. I wouldn't recommend this prof if you want an easy A.",0
"Her tests and quizzes are extremely hard. Even if you improve and try hard at the end, if you don't reach certain points, you won't pass. She's not student friendly, imo. There's no extra credit. She write/drew notes on board until the class end. This class need 100% attention or gg. Won't take her class ever again. Not a fun class.",0
"NOT a fun course to take. The material is interesting. I like the narrative format of the online discussion questions. He is a HARD marker. You have to somehow know exactly what he wants to hear otherwise it is wrong. Multiple choice is written to confuse, not prove your knowledge. Felt like he was on an intellectual power trip with grading.",1
I thought he was a great teacher. I'm not sure if he's still around though. I'd take a class w him again for sure! The first text I got a D and ended that class w an A! You learn some abstract things & he makes it easy to understand. He had study groups w him available for us to attend--he even bought us pizza and drinks at Woodstock b4 the final!,1
"If you skip class you would not pass this class. She takes a little time to get used too, and sit in front of the class! Take notes and ask questions! There is so much homework in the class, but it is great because it is a huge part of your grade. So if you do bad on the test, the homework grade will help :) Ask questions too! Good Luck!",1
The nicest physical science professor Ive ever met at cal. He cares so much and is more than willing to accommodate and be flexible with you. The class is really interesting but you have to want to learn the material. The only negative is that assignments sometimes have really unclear grading policies and take a while to get back,1
This class had potential. however the professor teaching it isn't a teacher. She isn't a director or even a decent human being. If you take a class with her you'll regret it..,0
"He is really fun and makes the lectures entertaining, I didn't do amazingly in the class because I struggle with multiple choice and there was soooo much content but he is a really good professor and really good at explaining.",1
"For those who rated him low, they are just lazy! It's college, you will need to put effort to get a good grade. No teacher will hand it to you. He is a fantastic professor, and knows his material well. Take him if you're serious and not lazy. 10% extra credit if you do them all! I recommend him!",1
"Professor Tanoukhi is by far the most invested professor I have ever had. She truly wants your reading and writing skills to improve and really puts the effort in to see results. She is very strict about finishing readings by the deadline & expects the most, but with good intentions. She wants people to succeed, and if you do the work, you will. ",1
"The absolute best instructor I've had at Baker. Most instructors don't understand learning online, but Vincent absolutely does. He gives great feedback and the tools to actually learn.",1
"I very much enjoy professor Lee Ritchey class, his class is not at all difficult, he provides great examples on how a speech should be done, which can get difficult but nothing impossible. I never felt bored in class because his teaching style was very informative and humorous. If you get the chance take his class, go for it :)!",1
I thought his lectures are interesting but not mandatory if you study the powerpoints. Tests based on online quiz and lecture. MC tests were easy but you don't know what questions that are based on lectures will be in it. Some online quizzes answers can be found online but don't count on it. No curve so don't mess up on your exams.,1
Does not care about students and it shows!  Multiple choice exams ... he does not care about student learning!!,0
"She is a terrible teacher for physiology. She was forced to give everyone curves because her tests were always terrible. She goes way too fast, cannot explain anything, but she does try to be nice. Her grading is just....bad...half of the time she doesn't even know what she marked you off for. Avoid her at all costs!",0
"Felt like he has a hard time with the online format. Confusing and not updated due dates for assignments. Responsive to questions. Very little feedback on exams, but this seems almost epidemic in online courses. Pleasant instructor I got the impression he cared. He should work harder on the online class preparation I think it would help him out.",0
A phony and fraud -does not put time or effort into grading student work,0
"I've taken 2 online courses with this professor so far, and it feels like a burden has been lifted off my shoulders, and in addition, I learn so much more than what I already know or more. No joke, no BS, just do what he assigns, even if it's alittle late and you'll pass with flying colors.",1
I personally hate this class. The layout of the class is Horrible.,0
"I don't understand how Prof Marks is receiving good ratings. He is the most intimidating, condescending teacher ever. I had planned on getting my Spanish minor before this, but this class completely turned me around 180 degrees. He looks at the ceiling when he talks, doesn't answer questions, and extensive homework is due daily. Just dreadful.",0
very nice person!,1
"Since this class hasn't been taught in a long time, there's some trial and error to it. There are a large number of readings we're responsible for that we never get to in class. The citation style we use for class is also completely arbitrary as if she made it up, but make sure to follow her instructions clearly or you won't pass with a good grade",0
Just dont do it to yourself.,0
"She doesn't assign a lot of work, but she's     picky about grading.",0
"Professor Noland is by far the best professor I've had in college! Her personality and sense of humor make it easy for you to be comfortable in arguably one of the most uncomfortable classes (public speaking). I've never liked public speaking, but her feedback and welcoming classroom environment made it easier! Highly recommend!",1
"Mr. Wilson was cool. Only problem that I truly had was his lack of grading throughout the course. Since the class is based on writing, you don't really know what your grade is until the end of the semester. Fortunately, I received a B in the class, but was aiming for an A. If grades matter to you, do not take him. If not, go for it. Good luck!",0
"As a whole, the class was very disorganized. I honestly didn't know what my grade was for most of the semester. She wasn't very helpful during the semester. On hard grammar topics, she would literally spend a day on them (which doesn't make any sense). I can't recommend her as a prof.",0
I like the way he gives clear expectations and though I am very used to easy A's I am glad that Professor Reese does not simply hand me my grade.,1
"Awesome professor, boring class. He definitely is an extremely smart prof who knows main interest is in cancer biology. Study the powerpoints and old test till your eyeballs fall out and you'll get a B+/A-/A.",1
"6 reflection papers (1 dropped), 2 in-class essay exams, and 1 research paper. An A is pretty difficult to achieve since the class is graded by such few things and Jason doesn't curve, but it's possible. Lots of reading, more than most classes, but manageable. TAs are helpful and participation matters in discussion sections. Class taught me a lot.",1
"She's very nice, and the homework is incredibly easy. But she's incredibly unclear about what she wantsexpects, which can lead to missing a deadline because she wasn't clear about the deadline, and she refuses to take late work (except of course when she doesn't). Nice, but not a college-level teacher. Lots of youtube music videos and an easy book",0
"Easy class if you watch the lectures, and take notes. Nice professor, really enjoys when his class is doing well. He added a 2 point bonus for everyone. He is very helpful during office hours.",1
"This was by far one of the worst teachers I've taken during my college career. She's unruly, rude, and makes you feel less than adequate if you don't understand the material. The labs were extremely hard to do online and not in person. Most of the time the material she said was ""going to be on the exams"" in fact weren't. Please take another teacher",0
The cutest professor you'll ever have! Curve is not 13%. It's about 6% but depends on the year.,1
He is a great guy. He is class is super easy but this is not enough! If you want to learn something from his class you need to read the book by yourself.,1
"A nice prof who obviously cares, but extremely disorganized. Never prints enough copies of midterms, and once made 30 students leave and come take the exam a week later because of this. Changes his office hours without warning and regularly skips or reteaches material because he forgets what we've done. Easy class but stressful and frustrating.",0
"She does not give any feedback after homework and tests. This is an online class and without feedbacks, you cannot easily do corrections and prepare for exams. She does not care about what situation you are in (COVID) and she will gladly give you an F and when you ask for corrections she wouldn't give them to you because she is too lazy to do them.",0
"Although I had absolutely no interest in operations going in, Darwin was a great teacher who made the various topics interesting. Probably one of the top MBA classes I've taken because it exposed me to something I had no knowledge of previously, and his very dry sense of humor made it even better. Definitely take this class with Darwin!",1
Many things werent graded until after you took your final so you never knew how you were truly doing in the class. Emails took days to get a response.,0
Listen to me! If you are planning on taking her class RUN! as far away as possible you wont pass. She is the worst professor at Valencia. You will not learn you will write 8 papers every Wednesday. And her test is hard even the multiple choice but majority of her test is open answer and all she talks about is giraffes! Online work kills you! RUN,0
"Angie is just okay. She is very nice, but her expectations are unclear and her knowledge on the subject is limited. I liked the class, though.",1
"Made Atlantis Debate harder than you would think.  Often times the class seems unstructured, but always went quickly.  Interesting some days and boring others.  Wears funny glasses, but not a bad teacher at all.  Have no idea how he is about music.",1
You'll acquire next-level independent study skills - a real gem!,0
"Under the impression teaching A&P was not her first choice and it shows. She is a speed reader and will not slow down to give time for note taking from the time class starts until 5 minutes after. No make-ups, no late work, no excused absences, doesn't present the material in a clear way. Minimum of 15 hr study week, no multiple choice test. ",0
"Read the text on your own easier to understand. Nice person, boring teacher. Could have been a great subject if it was more interesting and engaging. Assignments not clearly explained, expectations and course content could be explained better. Lost interest in subject.",0
"Lots of reading but let me tell ya. Dr. Heth is my favorite professor ive ever had in my 4 years at Taylor. He is a man of God, he offers so much wisdom and knowledge, and he courageously follows the Lord even when others dont agree. Amazing feedback he really reads your papers and offers some helpful tips and acknowledges your successes.",1
"This class was so hard. I really struggled with it, even after studying a LOT! I did pass, barely! The tests never seemed to be what I expected or we were encouraged to study. This didn't help my HATE for history. I did much better in the 2nd part of this class with a better teacher.",0
Professor Lane teaches well and will make sure you understand the material. In Cisc110 we were given quizzes weekly that usually allowed you to attempt it 3 times. Having the multiple tries was nice in understanding my mistakes. Highly recommend her.,1
"She is terrible. Does not offer any help or assistance and just doesn't care about students.  RUN, if you can!(I really hope that she reads these comments and learns from them).",0
Spencer has structured this class such that your grade depends on you knowledge of Accounting Vocabulary more than your actual knowledge of accounting.  So read the vocabulary sections and you should be ok...don't really expect to learn very much accounting though...,0
"LOVE HIM! Is passionate about the material, and the weekly quizzes were a great way to boost marks. His lectures are easy to understand and he is very accessible if you have questions and concerns. I would recommend this class to anyone even if you are just taking it to fulfil a core.",1
end of the semester and STILL no exam grade?! you have got to be kidding me.  One excuse after another. Guy is a complete joke,0
He is a terrible professor. He has papers throughout the semester. He is the hardest grader I have ever seen. I reached out for help and he basically told me to drop the class. His exams are difficult. He makes everything difficult. None of his feed back is useful at all. I WOULD NOT take him if i was you. He is a nice guy. Just a poor professor.,0
She goes right off her powerpoints which teaches you NOTHING: you can obviously read. she gives you chapters to read each night but does TEACH you anything. she gives reviews for exams but then SURPRISE: only a few things she went over is actually on the exam. Papers are easy. Exams are hard. POP QUIZZES!!!,0
Made us believe turning in review packets would give us 5 points on each test that they were turned in for and apparently this is not the case because my final grade is 6% lower than it should be.,0
There are no classes only discussions if a student can help host a zoom for him. There is no syllabus and it's stressful because there is no structure. He is a very sweet guy and tries his best to teach during these trying times but I don't recommend him for online classes. The only two things he's grading is a midterm and a final that's it.,0
"He is not nice with students. When we ask something, not in the class, but when we're doing the exercises, he is rude.",0
"Kristi always tells us to communicate with her if there are any questions/issues, but she never replies. She isn't clear with what she wants and is a very, very slow grader. Wants us to have long responses to other people's posts but there's not much to talk about. Lectures are just videos after videos. Why am I paying money just to watch videos?",0
It is not easy to get high grade. But he allows you to revise. You can learn a lot from this class.,1
100% take this class. So extremely easy and the online textbook is a really amazing learning tool. Super easy and quick grader. I took an online class but I still could feel like he truly cares about his students. The only downside to class was the textbook was very expensive.,1
"Very well oragnized class. Do your homework and participate during classtime. The end result will be a great experience in literature stories,poems,plays and a good grade.",1
She was very helpful and nice. She''ll answer any questions you''ll have and always makes her class interesting. I would love to take her again for Eng 112 but sadly she only teaches ENG 111. ,1
"If you're actually interested in learning, do not take her class. Doesn't have the in depth knowledge to explain the material well or derive stuff. Was telling in the class how hard the grad school was and how she was getting pretty poor grades. However if you just want to get an easy course without needing any proper deep understanding, she is ok.",0
"This class wasn't the best, but definitely an easy A if you show up to class and listen to the lecture. There is a quiz once a week, but she tells you exactly what is going to be on it the class before at the end of the lecture, so make sure you come to class. A summary for homework every week on a chapter and a few follow-up activities.",1
Loves him some rubrics. Cool guy. Learned a lot.,1
easiet course ive ever taken.,0
She is very nice and caring. She will always remind you of the due dates for her assignment. It is a fairly easy class.,1
"He will quickly scribble a list of ""how-to"" instructions and while your trying to catch up on writing he just explained 3 other things you have no chance of understanding anymore. He doesn't allow the student time to absorb. You may only see one example per topic. If you heard it one time and took your notes thats good enough for him. Sink or swim.",0
"First of all, Pannell seems like a great guy and will respond to you if you have any questions. The way he lectures is a little tough to follow. He will kind of bounce around and fly through powerpoints. He does give decent study practice tests for the tests. Overall not a bad guy, his teaching style just wasn't for me.",0
"Worst professor ever. Doesnt give good direction and even when the whole class doesnt understand instruction, she does nothing to help. If she is unsatisfied with your work, you are only able to receive half credit because it wasnt revised by the due date. So its not even worth it. Would not recommend.",0
"This is my second semester with Dr. Hug and I cannot recommend her enough. She is easily the best professor I have ever had. She gets you interested in the subject, presents material well, and is very helpful if you go to her. She is not only an amazing and hilarious person, but exceptionally knowledgable and an overall amazing professor!",1
"tests were HARD but obviously doable, people were getting 100% on her tests. Very funny in class but I found her to be harsh during office hours which caused me to stop going, she made me feel less than and a bit dumb to be honest. Her class is hard, just do the work, go over lectures and you should be fine",0
"this course has such bare content that it could be compressed easily into half a semester. the prof has a likable personality. hes not a bad teacher but doesnt go above and beyond either. do the questions in the book but expect a little tougher on the exam, and you should be ok.",1
Profesor Nesvig was such a great teacher. It was such an amazing experience to go to his class. He always explained his subjects with details and you can tell that he put many years and time into perfecting his lesson plan. It was not a hard class at all; the quizzes were super easy just a few short-answer questions. Awesome class.,1
"Great instructor, explains things well, she let me re do an assignment for a better grade. She definitely holds the attention of the class and is really informative. I would take another class from her.",1
No Comments,0
Awesome teacher!! Cares about the students(which is rare nowadays). Goes out of her way and expects nothing more than what she puts into it. Take this class if you have the chance.,1
"She is nice, but she is EXTREMELY ""loopy.""  She forgets things all the time and even changed her teaching topic mid-sentence into something totally unrelated! It's pretty scary. It can be very frustrating. If you have other options for piano, I would strongly consider them.",0
"I took EDUC 2110E as an online class for the summer. It is only a month long so it is very fast paced. Overall, I enjoyed the course. It is very important to read the text book. If you keep on the work, it is very easy to do well in his course.",1
Professor Leung is my favorite teacher I've had class with at DU.  His classes were always entertaining and he is more interested in a student learning something from his class than their grade.  His tests are fair and his power points are so thorough I never used my textbook.  Wish all my business math classes had been taught by him.,1
"Won't provide any keys, will ask questions you haven't seen in homework or in class, will not curve, lots of useless POGIL, writes on board often (cannot read his handwriting). Recommend taking lab at the same time because he will ask stuff in lecture that you've only learned in the lab. Only positive thing I can say is that he's pretty nice.",0
She will explain everything and easy and nice way. I love her and believe me you will enjoy her class.,0
"She really thinks she is an intellectual, and will hold it over anyone who doesn't meet her standards. Snobby and unpleasant to learn from. Demeaning. She needs to work on her personal issues and know when to leave them at the door. There are better teachers at BCC.",0
Extremely SCATTERBRAINED! Lets you use cheat sheets during tests but not the final! Tells more stories about her family and illnesses than the actual info you need to know. Group work with a different group every time! Always changes due dates and be ready to have multiple mistakes made when grading your tests! So hard to follow! Steer Clear!!!,0
"I don't know what these other raters were smoking, but this professor is terrible.  If you want an easy A take her class, but you wont learn anything substantial.  This class is all business buzzwords about ""synergy"" and ""social responsibility.""  Also, the project is ridiculous and she centers her class around the project, rather than the book.",0
DO NOT TAKE HIM!! I took the 8 week online class and asked for help with the Excel project and got no response. I emailed him 4 times and got a response that did not explain anything. Way more than just the usual computer stuff. I get all A's in my classes but will be lucky to get a C.,0
terrible dont go to class the test is so easy and you dont use your lecture notes.,0
"I like the way Waxler chooses interesting books and the way we engage in discussion, although the classes seem too big for that purpose. A lot of quizzes--keep us reading. And a couple of longer essays. Makes literature seem worthwhile.",1
"Worse Teacher ever. I got "" B"", but he is busy talking bout his life n some other things. try to finish everything at the end.  Doesnt knw how to average out. Not good at replying back.",0
"Dr. Proga was kind, really passionate about astronomy, wanted students to enjoy learning, and didn't want to make the class stressful. He made funny jokes once in a while and liked to talk to the class conversationally. Easy class since he gives you the exam questions beforehand.",1
"The group progect was a nightmare. JP decided to be a ""bad customer"" on purpose and make it as hard as possible for everyone to get it done. His tests are also much harder than they need to be. Be prepared to bring every slide he uses on your notes, maybe you'll get a good score then.",0
"His class is meant for people who have never looked at a piece of sheet music before, so he's very thorough in explaining the basics. Sometimes he gets tongue-tied because of his accent, but it's not an issue. Some class work, your choice in getting the book because he posts everything on the board. Few easy assignments. Try to participate",1
"Teacher is very nice,but is very confusing, goes beyond what is required which makes it confusing, grades random problems and i have never done so poorly in a class until this class. Went to the tutor center many times to get help. I would not reccomend this class unless you are very good at math and need little help or you want to retake it.",0
"I have never loved a teacher more. Sister Kirkham really cares, she works with and understands every student. If you do the work and try your best you will do well. She is all about helping her students succeed. I found a love for writing after taking this class.",1
"I took Prof. Smith's FE429 (Futures and Options). That was tough. His lectures were very unclear, explanations were confusing (at best). Well educated, but arrogant and ignorant of his class. This class was an elective.",0
"During her lectures, she would speak unclearly and move at her own pace. Yes she waited a few seconds, but always hurries to the next problem. At the end of the day, I would have to go home, view examples from the mylabsplus, and teach myself. She is very cooperative and polite though when you are speaking one on one with her.",0
HE'S THE BEST!!!!(:,1
bring a pillow....ZzZZzZzzzZz....1 group pres./1 individual/midterm/final thats his class...from what i rem. i had good power naps in his class.,0
Very boring professor who seems to drag on lecture as everyone falls asleep. Does not seem to care about students or their situations and is not very helpful in person individually either. Would try to take another professor.,0
"Basically a self-teach class. She reads straight off the slides and is very unorganized. There is a quiz after every chapter, she speeds through every chapter so the quizzes are every other day. She says she's always available but has never once responded to my emails. Didn't learn much either. Just study and you're likely to pass.",0
"Excellent teacher and nurse, but don't be late or miss clinicals. She gets very annoyed if you show the least bit of apathy or not enough effort. But she is very helpful if you go to her for help, and a very interesting person. She's not easy, so study study study. Just do your best and you will do alright!",1
"One of the most arrogant professors I've ever encountered. Not helpful what so ever, and very condescending. I had a few issues in the course because of a BBLearn error, but said it would be alright and in the end got upset, even though I had outreached to him. I didn't mind the content or the work, it was just his lack of willingness to help.",0
"Professor Mantell is sweet, but there is too much information on the powerpoints. Grading for Lab is super easy. She does provide a study for each test. I highly recommend takin BIO before taking this class.",1
She is an excellent teacher. She makes you do assignments throughout the semester that all revolve around a 8-10 page final research paper. Those assignments are not too difficult and will help you out immensely when the research paper rolls around. Definitely would take her again if I could!,1
The best online instructor I've had.  She is very engaged and in touch with the class.  Highly recommended.,1
"Mirabai is an incredible person and an inspirational teacher. She is deeply caring, wise, interesting, and a radical & courageous leader. Taking a class with Mirabai is an opportunity not to be missed.",1
"She really is a nice lady, but I cannot recommend her online class as a full-time student. Extremely heavy workload. Final exam ruined my grade when I had been passing for most of the semester. Only half of the students earned a B or above, and the average was 71%. I felt like the course was way too challenging for an introductory language class.",0
Aren is really helpful and always makes lectures interesting. The topic changes each week which keeps the class moving and prevents you from being bored,1
A+ I Dnt knoe wht idiot rated this guy a 3. This is the easiest class i have every took. Test are straight foward and EASY. I never met a teacher that wants the class to learn. just come to class and he will make u understand what hes saying  in the simplest way. He does alot of practice in the board so that means tht you will be read for the test.,1
"I completed all of the discussion posts and followed the rubric and even cited the sources and used direct quotes from videos provided by the professor only to still receive failing grades on each discussion posts. Her direct responses for one of my discussion posts were ""clearly you know how to read and write"" but then gives me a bad grade",0
"If I could describe his class with one word, ""disorganized."" His scribbling on the board was hard to read and all over, making note taking a tedious and pointless process. Difficult to follow along in class. Not much notice was given on when tests, quizzes, and worksheets were to be assigned. Unless he changes his ways, avoid him if possible.",0
She is a tough grader.,0
"Professor Aviles-Santiago was extremely helpful over the semester. The class was fun and interesting, he was flexible with assignments and went out of his way to help me succeed in this course. I would definitely take a class from him again. ",1
"Don't take him for math! He's a computer teacher, not algebra, and he can't explain anything. Despite this he was very nice, made lots of beer jokes, and tried to help as much as possible. He was just not meant to teach math. Only take this if you need math courses beyond it or remember a LOT from high school algebra, otherwise take MATH127. l",0
She's nice and sometimes willing to adjust due dates. Class is boring and I did a lot of hw for other classes in there. Group projects are frequent if she thinks yall aren't paying attention. Some quizzes too. Not very clear about her grading criteria. She'll say what she wants in an assignment and then grade it depending on something else.,1
"Professor Trower is a very kind professor who really cares about his student's success. He can be a little difficult to understand sometimes, but he tries to make things clear. He is not tech savy, don't expect tech help from him, its not his job anyway!",1
"Her projects were really fun and interesting.  she is hard on crafstmanship.  she is really nice and friendly.  tough to understand at times.  contradictory in critiques sometimes.  she grades tough, almost impossible to get an A.  it's possible but very difficult.",0
"I had to drop this class. I don't know Spanish, so it was even harder. The tests were impossible (completely in Spanish, even the instructions). Even people who do know Spanish failed his tests. He doesn't give any extra credit, even if you beg. *DO NOT TAKE*",0
"“Best prof” at Hamilton?  Werner is smug, self-absorbed, and aloof, except to a few of his favorites.  He shows little interest in student opinions.  He plays mind games.  He penalizes students for not meeting his hidden expectations.  That all adds up to one lousy professor.  I got a decent grade from him, but I found him distasteful.  Avoid him.",0
Worst Teacher ever.... boring lectures.,0
"Literally the worst teacher I have had at Providence College. Her lectures make no sense whatsoever because she doesn't understand what she is teaching. Her exam questions do not reflect what she has ""taught."" You will receive nothing from lecture and you will have to teach yourself everything. She will kill BIO for you if you take her.",0
Dr. Guttmann is an extremely intelligent man. His lectures are both knowledgeable and interesting. He is one of the few instructors who truly lecture in the biology department. His tests are really hard though. All short answer and fill in the blank. Do know how to spell his full name it will probably pop up as extra credit on the test.,1
"He's actually not that bad, I think.  It's hard to tell whether he is mean, hateful and condescending or whether he's trying to be funny.  Whatever it is though he really needs to work on his personality.  He's a graduate student that isn't ready to be teaching yet.  I've had graduate students before who were amazing, he is not one of them.",0
Did not enjoy this class at all. Her lectures are really boring and she doesn't clarify much... She is a really hard marker. ,0
"I do appreciate how he has great experience in international business, and it shows, but that's all he talks about. Himself. The stories are real world applications and that's great, but when it comes to midterm and final time, you have to teach yourself everything he did not have time to cover as he talked about himself all class.",0
"Truly a terrible teacher. She is a very bias grader, holds grudges for unknown reasons, constantly contradicts herself and offers no helpful criticism or guidance. Hard to believe gets paid to do what she does. My advice: stay far away",0
Hard grader and a lot of homework also grading system is messed up.,0
He is a good teacher.  Funny.  You will need your text book for the class. You roll a dice to see if you have a quiz every day there is a 50/50 we had 3 all semester.,1
He doesn't explain anything well and the entire grade was just based of the midterm and the final. Homework wasn't collected and quizzes don't affect grades. The tests ask for a lot of definitions and proofs and had way too many parts to finish in 1 hr. He doesn't communicate with his TAs properly so they don't know what is going on either.,0
"He is a great professor that is very passionate about what he teaches. He uses clickers to take attendance during class, but it only counts for a small percentage of your grade. A lot of the material covered for the exams can be found in the textbook.",1
"MBA class, foundation. Lots of busy work for 3 days or a week, lots of reading, articles from Harvard Business, basically preps you for school, helps you identify your goals for your MBA, gets you ready for school. Awesome person to talk to, caring, provides feedback, and guides you in the right direction, knowledgable.",1
This professor only lectures and doesn't let others talk. Hard to participate or be engaged when so negative and rude.,0
Dr. Batman is usually confused and unable to write out the answer to his own problem because he forgets steps or starts over three or four times. He really needs a wake-up call because he is failing to get students engaged because they do not understand the material.,0
"His assignments are easy, but he will challenge you.  He is one of those professors who lays out arguments and presents counterarguments while very infrequently telling his own opinions.  Make sure you participate frequently and well, because I got a nice bump on my final grade and he takes attendance.  He is helpful and seems like a cool guy.",1
"She openly admits to not being good at lecturing and it shows quickly. She clearly has experience but she can't form the sentences to properly share her knowledge. Nice woman, kind of funny, but it does not make up for her flaws. We had one big group project that was near impossible. Tests suck too. Quit now.",0
she wants all of her students to pass the class but she doesn't really teach. You MUST learn from the online homework or you wont do well in this class but she is  very helpful if you don't understand.,1
"Very disorganized, late to class and not the best person to explain a course to students who aren't good with math in general. I would not recondmend taking her but I would recommend Michael green.",0
Professor Reese is the type of professor that each teacher should strive to be like. He is ultimately the best teacher I have had while being in college. He totally understands the material that needs more attention and focuses on the criteria that is necessary. He is very understanding and always communicates well when there is a problem at hand.,1
Shes an awesome teacher and helps as much as she can. Tests can be easy if you know the material. 3 exams.,1
"While Professor Schlortt is very knowledgeable in his subject, this is by far the worst teacher I have ever had. He fails to communicate clearly outside of class. He fails to provide tools to help you succeed on quizzes and tests in a timely manner. He is antagonistic with his feedback. The list could go on forever, avoid this excuse of a teacher.",0
This lady was pregnant the whole semester and still managed to make the class fun and easy.  No kidding....this chick was still teaching like two days before going into labor!!  What a warrior!!  And was back in class like 3 days later like nothing happened!!  Amazing!!,1
"Business cal is a hard course. You will not get everything out of just going to her class and listening to her lectures, BUT she has always been there for help. I have a gap before her class and she is always in the math lab helping her students. Kim loves what she does and she is always very helpful and if you put in the work she will help! ",1
I'm maybe not the biggest lover of math so math courses aren't my favorite thing but great teacher for this course for sure.,1
"Assignments are not specific. Whenever I ask her a question, her response is ""refer to the assignment."" Poor grammar that makes the assignments confusing. Posts assignments in modules that are not due that week. Would not recommend this teacher to anyone. I've taught myself more about communications than she's taught me. Teacher's Rate: 0",0
"He sat on his computer the whole class and when you asked for help, and didnt understand the way he explained it, he just got annoyed. He told me that if I was too stupid to learn it in high school, he couldnt teach it to me now. It was a really upsetting experience.",0
Buddy doesn't explain anything. He literally sends YouTube videos as lectures and he gets mad when you ask him something. His expectations aren't clear for work.,0
"Among the worst professors I've ever had. She projects blame onto students for her own lack of knowledge, ridiculously vague and contradictory requirements, and even her inability to use basic teaching technology like Carmen or MS Word. When you point out her contradictory requirements or mistakes she makes, she comes down hard on you. Rude. Awful.",0
This was a great class and Im so happy I took it. This professor teaches well while still letting his students pursue the type of art they want to do. Hes very nice and easy to talk to and his lectures are great and always relevant to business outside of the classroom.,1
"! He is very intelligent and knows all the material, issue is how he teaches. He will work out 3 problems from a section and move on. Then he will assign hw problems with numerous problems we never went over. HW will take you hours to complete. I asked to help many times and was told to read the book. Moves to quick and seems bothered my questions.",0
"Her tests are WAY hard.  I have her for 132 and I believe it is her first year teaching this.  Very nice teacher but I feel unprepared for her tests.  Lots of notes are given, but tests are more application then anything.  BRING A RECORDER. Notes overlap alot, and she hardly brings discussions down to student level.  Very technical.",0
"She is a very nice person. I really enjoyed her class that's why I took more than one speech class with her. Before her class I was always interested to speak in front of the class, but I never was encouraged or pushed to do so and she helped me a lot with that. I respect her and she is one of my favorite teachers. I would recommend her.",1

"If you are in the psychology field, it is a must to learn about your professors as you expect them to learn about you. You must read and learn the flow of this class and if you are involved and listen to her lectures, she pretty much tells you what will be on every graded quiz or test. Reach out and you will be met at the other end. Effort is key",1
"all over the place, hard to follow, nothing makes sense. Nice lady",0
"I have noticed how unclear he is in the past when it comes to papers and such, but it has never mattered...until the final group paper in this class.  Make sure you get what he wants in the paper clarified before you even begin researching, otherwise it will cost you in the end even if he says you will get full credit as long as you do everything.",1
I was intimidated by this class as I'm not familiar with HTML coding but this was an easy A! She has step by step instructional videos. Tests were easy too,1
"You learn a lot from class than any other high school or human sexuality courses. It's true he talks about his life A LOT so likely you won't get through the whole chapter. His exams are hard so study repeatedly. I had open book but I still ended up with a C so be prepared, attendance is key, read during lectures, and stay awake he watches everyone",0
"She is so well known for her love of the LGBTQ+ community that even people in Africa have heard of: ""The Great STINNETTE"". Her ability to keep up with the times, and her academic professionalism (the way she teaches by using YouTube videos is inspiring) keeps me wondering how the world could deserve someone as dedicated as her. Chirp Chirp, Torian!",0
"most AMAZING professor i have ever taken in my life. she is SO caring. she lets you come in early before the quiz since they are timed. she lets you come for extra help and will explain it until you understand it. she gives extra credit. she explains a&p perfect and gives visual real life examples. most caring, genuine professor that wants u 2 pass",1
Hilarious!!!,1

"I took this professor online for Pre-Cal and let's just say the work was the easy part. In the syllabus she has a chart that shows you what is needed to be exempt from the final, which also also states that if you're close she will make an adjustment. I exceeded the points, but she failed to realize that and didn't grade my discussion board either!",0
"Good guy, know's his stuff, successfully engages individuals in class concepts and conversations.",1
Simply one of the best professors at the University of Maryland. He emphasizes the concepts of importance and makes very fair exams. Funny and great to talk to outside of class. You don't see very many professors nowadays who are helpful and kind.,1
Professor was super hilarious but you won't learn anything. I barely passed the class bc I dont learn anything from his lectures. He is the funniest but that doesn't help me pass the class. Maybe he should change his profession to a comedian and not a mathematician.,0
It's hard to put a bad rating for this professor because he cares and could potentially bring so much to the class with life experiences. Although he didn't really teach and thinks all problems are trivial for a first time dynamics student. Multiple choice tests are lazy and unfair in my eyes for an engineering student. Don't expect it to change,0
"For the school he is at he was difficult. I have taken five classes from him at this point and have learned so much. He's unique in his approach, but definitely have respect for him, even if I don't always agree with him.",1
awful teacher. would never take this class again,0
"Susan is a great math instructor. She works with the class on anything that they aren't really clear on, even to the point of changing the homework schedule and the content on the exams. She brings real world examples into lectures to further clarify the concept. She really does give each student the opportunity to be successful. Great experience.",1
He's not good at teaching on how to write a paper.,0
Professor Freed is easily the worst professor I've ever had. She teaches like a kindergarten teacher but grades like a grad school professor. She's useless at getting information across but she will grade your papers impossible hard. I'm an english major and I've never had a professor who grades like Freed. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES.,0
"Honestly it was more the class teaching him. Hes pretty old and gets things confused. He does give you good tips and shows how things are done, but he says he gives points for setting up problems on tests and he doesnt. If you dont do great on a few things, scores make you fail.",0
He made the class really fun with his jokes and zoom backgrounds. He dropped 29 knewton homework and made it extra credit for those who did all of them. His gradings are merciful(with partial credits ). Do the exam review resources he provides on canvas and you are set. The textbook is for free but honestly I have never looked at it.,1
"WORST PROFESSOR I'VE EVER HAD! IF YOU HAVE TO DELAY GRADUATION TO AVOID HIM, ITS WORTH IT BECAUSE YOU WILL STRUGGLE & FAIL ANYWAY! doesn't show you how to work out a problem, just scribbles all over the board and mumbles/trails off, no structure to his lectures, gives problems on tests that you've never seen before. 90% of my class failed or go D's",0
"During covid, she chose to have her whole class asynchronous. The content is very dry and sometimes copied word for word from the textbook. There is nothing captivating about the class since you only look at the slides and lecture notes and readings. She also clearly doesn't read my emails b/c she doesn't ever answer my questions.",0
"Her classes were interesting, but she grades so hard. She hardly ever gives full credit for anything. I would never take this professor again. She is very strange. I ended up with an 89.5 and she would not round me up to an A.",0
"Whoever said Maria isn't respectful must be talking about someone else. I've taken her 3 times and she Is SO intelligent. Depending on the class you take, she is so educated  on topic & makes the class fun. Definitely assigns a lot of work but it's relevant... she is willing to compromise with class sometimes if we aren't happy with assignments.",1
He tries to make the lectures relatable and tries to keep everyone engaged. You HAVE to read the textbook or you won't pass. You also don't need to read each chapters 3 times to get an A. Take the first test seriously bc usually everyone bombs it because everyone tries to memorize the book rather than understand the material. Solid professor,1
"Also, the lectures are very boring. He thinks we are dumb and we don't know anything. He makes us feel like we are uneducated students. I have never felt so low in my life, I have always gotten A's in college except for his class. I recommend to him, respect your students because without students you are not a teacher.",0
"Literally made an account on RMP to say that Barry Thompson is the best professor I've ever had. Would recommend to anyone taking Ochem B - he's seriously the most caring, respectful, and ""on top of it"" person.",1
"Pretty easy class, easy homework, and easy exams.  Nice woman, but she is technologically challenged.  Funny somtimes, but it got annoying.",1
"I'm convinced Professor Brannigan-Wisniewski wrote that comment on December 14th talking about a ""disgruntled"" student. Honey - face the reality of what the students are saying and get over it. We didn't enjoy your class and you clearly aren't the best at communications contrary to what your profession might state. Reflect on yourself! Disgusting",0
"Scott is a pretty good teacher. He is really patient and helpful when you need it. His tests were reasonable, and he covered the material that you needed for the tests. He will at least try to learn your name, and you can tell that he does care. The homework load wasnt too bad. Overall, good instructor and good class.",1
"This was my first philosophy class, even though it was a 200 level class. Almost every quiz and exam is online which is really nice. However, this means that you have to take notes every class because she doesn't post a lot of the powerpoints  online. She really enjoys talking about cats. Kind of boring, but an easy A for me.",1
Extremely hard grader. He is very smart and lectures the entire class. He gives breaks in the middle which last about a minute. very hard to follow and gives a ton of information. only take this class if you love reading the textbook every night.,0
"Prof is very knowledgeable but a lousy prof who does not value students ""thinking outside the box"". Will tell you one thing, but when you do it, it wont be good enough and you will have to change it at least 3-4 times. He will even tell you he doesnt like something he has approved first.I was exited to learn at first, but he really killed it for me",0
Really great professor and made the class super easy to pass.,1
"Soh at times is a nice person, but I would not recommend her as a professor for LITED 3115. The class itself is already so much work, but she takes forever to return your work and she'll ask you to completely change your lesson plans the day of teaching them. She doesn't answer your emails and when she does it's not a kind reply. Not worth it.",0
I wouldn't recommend takin Professor Ni. She lectures a lot from her head which is okay but sometimes she forgets and there is no energy in the way she teaches so it's very easy for students to not be interactive with her.,0
Took her for online government. There are 4 chapters lots of reading and several quizzes that take up to 2hrs but u always get 100. These only make 5% of the grade. 3 exams (online) and a final. Exams are not hard if you actually read all of the lectures.,1
"Prof. Uzcategui is passionate about nutrition and health, for sure. Attendance is graded and an app is used to track it, so you have to show up. Her lectures do get really boring at times and I actually fell asleep twice in her class despite never falling asleep in any other classes before. Still, her class is more than fair and I would recommend.",1
"Marks entire letter grades off reports for minor mistakes that isn't even an out-of-order lab report. (Insert graph after the wrong line? A -> C.) Don't take if you're looking to get a good grade for your hard work. Also, experiments are uninteresting and always inconclusive. Almost no equipment; Take a lab somewhere else.",0
"Doug is very down to earth! Getting the packet for the class will really help. You can get extra credit on tests. If you don't understand animal science very well then it might be a little difficult, but you can still definitely get an A in the class.",1
"Monotone, non-existent, Tough grader,shows zero effort towards class and teaching. Sometimes uses his phone in class.",0
Paul can come off as a bit stoic at first. This is not true at all. He cares about his students and is very accommodating. He is willing to set times up outside of class to meet and go over things. Paul expects improvement and pays attention to pronunciation and grammar. So practice before oral exams and have a Dane run through your essays.,1
"Jamie is one of the worst professors I have ever had. She is hopelessly repetitive, completely uninformative, and vague with expectations. She is also incredibly rude and condescending. Her grading is based on whether or not she ""feels"" you are trying hard, not your actual work. The is no actual dog handling in the course.",0
"I believe I took her on her first year of teaching so she was very new and you could tell she didn't know what she was doing. Her exams were okay, just study off the power point slide notes. Her final is a combination of all her past exams. Basically I give her a 7/10.",1
"Professor Birnbaum is a interesting teacher. He is unorganized with his lectures and grading. All over the place. IF you ask a question he will make you feel incompetent. tests are ridiculous, the study guide barely helps. I would advise taking this class with a different teacher. he ruined my experience of forensics :(",0
he is a generous man but is opinionated and has a bit of an attitude at times. gives social work majors a hard time...24/7,1
"This professor has been so great! She really cares! This class is online and asynchronous, a challenge, but this professor is the most available of any I have ever had! So many of my classmates are trying to cheat and are mad that they can't in this class. Very organized. Straightforward. I am studying and doing great!",1
"I'm not one to use this application, but for this class, I'm going to have to make the exception. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. She is a tough grader, however she is also a very poor professor. She reads off the PowerPoint verbatim and is not good at answering questions. She has no problem teaching a chapter and testing you on it the same class. Overall, bad",0
Lectures can be hard to follow. Really nice and will always help you.,0
"Great class, great professor. Definitely worth attending classes.",1
"If you don't like to talk in front of a class, don't take him. He gives over 100 problems for homework and the only way to get credit for the homework is if you go to the ""homework days"" in which everyone, one by one, has to read the question and their answer. If you get it wrong and/or don't fully understand how to answer it correctly he gets mad.",0
Gave class 10 pnts to bring mean up to 60% on a particular exam. You can be absent a max of 8 times. 2 mins late? 1/2 absence. Will drop you without notice. Witnessed it happen to the guy next to me. Will dock points if you skip a super obvious step on an exam. Grades solely based on exams. 10 Qs per exam with his grading? Dont take this class,0
"His lectures and notes are very clear and he makes every effort to help students succeed in class. His tests are well structured and he balances short answer/essay with multiple choice and matching. Overall, seems to enjoy teaching and helps students see that studying science isn't so scary.",1
She will not hold your interest.,0
She is an amazing and kind person who cares about her students and does her best to help them succeed; she always makes herself available to her students. She can be VERY disorganized so it's important to read everything before class and really know the material b/c in lectures she can be confusing but will help make connections once you understand,1
"Upbeat, nice guy.  Always willing to help.  His grading system allows for mistakes throughout the semester.  Be a serious student and you will do fine in his classes.  I was actually very disappointed that he went on sabbatical this year and that I might not be able to have another class with him.",1
He is very convincing when it comes to acting as if he has no idea what students are up to. He is a very good writing teacher. I was able to improve my writing skills drastically through his Humanities course.,1
"Do NOT take this teacher. No curve. He refuses to meet with students outside of class. His exams are not derived from the lectures and textbook, especially the multiple choice. He is the worst professor in the BIOS department. Wait a semester for a different professor if you are able to.",0
It is recommended to review your grade with other students and the professor. His grading is inconsistent therefore ask for an answer key. He did not update grades in the D2L only grade posted online was the overall final.,0
Best professor by far at the University of Iowa. Super fun and helpful. Clearly passionate about her field. I am currently a Social Work major and I cannot emphasize how much I enjoy Sara's classes.,1
"I personally  liked his class! He uses the book a lot and you read about a bunch of different countries and cultures. His quizzes are over grammar, and I thought he did a good job at explaining grammar rules. He is a tough grader and his test are pretty hard. But an A is possible, it just depends on how much you want to work!",1
"EASY A, but he did pick on me alot through out the semester. He seems unhappy in his marriage and belittles you when your proud of your happy marriage. Like I said, EASY A, and gives extra credit as well as extra redit for attendence. Also, no need for book..",1
"About 45% of a math final made up of impossible T or F. Comes to class with no preparation. Most of the time students finish the problem for him. Never explains any terminology, yet expects us to know it for the exams. Likes to put on tricky problems. Won't take the time to answer questions. Kinda cocky in the British way. I def wouldn't recommend.",0
The most interesting individual I have ever met in college! Intelligent and charismatic in every way possible. The best professor I have ever taken at USC oR anywhere. Hes intimidating but loves his students.,1
"Great teacher. Humble and not full of himself and very helpful to his students both in and outside of class, I highly recommend him.",1
"I loved this prof!!  He took his time explaining every concept thoroughly. The questions on his midterm were very similar to the assignment questions there are no surprises on the quizzes, midterm or final. If you're good at math attendance is optional, if not his lectures will definitely help you.",1
"She really cares about your success in this class and does the projects with you during class so you know what you're doing. Very monotone, but she'll let you out of class early almost all the time because you're likely to finish. No homework as long as you finish your assignments in class and makes review lessons for the tests so you can get an A",1
"Very friendly individual and at first the class seems like it will be like any other math class. Slightly challenging but do-able. His exams, however are some of the hardest material I have ever seen. His examples and homework do not help at all. Save yourself the pain and do not take his class.",0
"Really makes you think and work for an A, but an absolutely fantastic teacher who clearly describes the content and offers up help at the drop of the hat. You get out what you put in, definitely.",1
Learned a ton from this professor! Did a lot of writing for him but I got a lot out of his class in exchange. He's very helpful during the writing process and alway's available for students. I started graduate school lacking some confidence but after taking his class I feel set up for success in the rest of my classes. Thank you!,1
"Great professor! He is a  little intimidating, but once you get comfortable you can get a lot from David and his class! He is helpful and lays out the assignments clearly. Very organized and quick to grade, plus he keeps his Moodle up to date! I really enjoy not having the stress of being tested, it makes it easier to take in what we are taught. ",1
"Dr. Avila is amazing professor, I have taken Chem I and II with her before organic and if you really want to learn and have take it easy a bit, she's the one to take. At times she is very serious, but most of the time she's very caring and sarcastic which makes her class enjoyable. I would highly recommend Dr. Avila to just about anyone.",1
She is very smart but sometimes treats her students like children. She yells a lot and is constantly taking phone calls during class. She does not put up with any type of nonsense. She can be very mean and rude. She is very tough but means well.,0
"she means weel for her student and is pro student rights, but she has trouble relating the materal to relife examples.  also, she barely goes over how to do problems unless someone ask how to do it.  she is a nice lady and offeres extra credit.  cant recommend her or not cuz from what i hear all the 1050 profs suck",0
"Antibiotics Research was a blast! Anitori is a good-humored guy who knows his stuff. Always felt like he gave us all the materials and information we needed to succeed in his class. He has ""pop quizzes"", but he tells you a week ahead of time that they're coming and what'll be on them. He (thankfully) doesn't know how to do a pop quiz.",1
"MWF exams were 5-7 questions, about 20 points, average never exceeded 50%. Average gets curved to an 80% but it's not a bell curve, so one bad exam screws you over big time. The final was 2 hours and out of 200 pts with same level of difficulty so many felt inadequately prepared. Sweetheart as a person, very difficult to follow in lecture though.",0
"I absolutely loved her! She really gets to know her students and honestly wants us to succeed. She will do as much as she can to make it easier, and her classes all have built-in extra credit!",1
"I took this class to fulfill a requirement. Did not expect much. Not really interested in politics, but the class fit my schedule and I had heard good things. Glad I took the class. Gave me a whole new perspective on politics and really kept my interest. I really liked all the current articles he sent students to illustrate course material",1
"She was terrible, annoying to communicate with.",0
"Meyer is arrogant and pompous, he thinks he is God's gift to philosophy and his word is gold. He constantly deviates from the schedule and dominates all conversation and tries to belittle anyone who disagrees with him. He uses class as a forum to disseminate his wacky secular progressive political dribble as well as impress any somewhat cute girls.",0
in grading papers he LOOKS for ways to take off points...the type of teacher who tries to make you do poorly...also never available for after class help..would strongly NOT recommend this class with him if you have any desire to get above a C,0
"HE'S SO AWESOME so caring so nice, hes really willing to help you out if you are willing to see him in his office",1
"I've been attending Leeward for 3 semester and he is, by far, my favorite teacher. He knows how to make you laugh so class goes by quickly and I found myself wanting to stay longer. And of course, his teaching is very clear to understand. Amazing teacher.",1
He has a not so funny sense of humor. He don't come off as very caring especially since how he didn't know many of my classmates names. He grades averagely. His lectures are very boring. It makes me want to fall asleep and many people want to drop/ have dropped because he don't allow to make up quizzes which is 10% of the grade.,1
"The worest Teacher on this planet 100% sure of it. Can not get any worse. Doesnt help students, makes fun of students. He gives us projects to do and we have not even completed the lecture on what we need to complete the projects.",0
"Took class online during summer session. Discussions were very easy. Two essays were required outside of the discussions. Start essays early because he expects A LOT from you! Make sure to follow guidelines on essays. Other than that, pretty easy class.",1
I am a criminology major so this course was very important for me. Our first test was supposed to be over 3 chapters and was only over 1 because she got so off topic while lecturing. She is not very organized and poor at communicating with students (especially during finals week). I have never been this unhappy with a teacher.,0
"I didn't get the feeling that this professor wanted me to learn japanese. It almost seemed like it annoyed her. Her quiz's and tests were pretty easy if you study. Watch out for her final, she made us do a oral presentation timed. Studying Japanese is my passion and I felt that her class took away a lot of that passion. Be ready to talk a lot in cl",1
"Terrible, Does not want to help you.  He talks down to you if you don't understand what he is teaching.  He goes around in circles and forgets what hes talking about.  Save yourself from this class.  I should have.",0
The lectures were great and he constantly made sure that everyone understood the material. No textbook is needed but you will need to pay for a program that provides access to the homework. Very easy to contact via email if having issues understanding the material or using the homework website. The study guides for each test are very thorough.,1
"HORRRRRRIBLE!!!!!!!! DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. Acts like you have your degree, gets mad at questions, arrogant, rude and makes you feel dumb. Dont let your gpa suffer. She explains nothing clearly and goes super quick in power points. Chem is about memorizing but she gave us a whole chart to memorize 2 days before an exam. Absolutely the worst",0
"Cute, fun, and quirky. She makes math fun and accessible to all. Would recommend",1
"too many group projects for online, worth 40% of grade tough grading on group assignments Makes it seem like an easy A class but quite difficult slides don't prepare you for the tests read the textbook",0
At first I was like OMG what did i get myself into. I thought he was a really nice guy. Gives work but he is really helpful if he sees you are trying. He tends to ramble off and loves to listen to himself talk.,1
"Worst professor yet. Hw and exam is a 400 word personal essay (informal). He reads everything directly out of the book with not explanation. He rambling a lot and gives unclear on essay assignment. He incapable of help you improve ur writing skill. he will noted when you received help even if you went to a tutor, he'll tell you not to do that again",0
"Easy class for biology 2, no anatomy of physio stuff at all; recommends using openstax free text but exams are based on simple powerpoints and are straightforward, mainly multiple choice very easy, & some open-ended q's a little harder. Plenty extra credit weekly. Overall lovely professor and person, you will miss her at end of semester. I love her",1
"Easy A, but the class is taught like a high school class. You have to show up to lecture and do worksheets. There is a lot of busy work.",0
"Mr. Kraft changed my mind about english.  I used to hate it and dread essays.  He made writing seem easy.  Great teacher, overly helpful! Always willing to proof read your essay.  Very supportive and wants you to succeed!  No tests just 4 essays.  Great teacher and great person!",1
Very good professor. You can learn a lot and get a decent grade if you put in your work. but 1191 is a heavy course no matter who is the professor.,1
"It was difficult for me to understand his lectures. He has some resources that may help his students on blackboard, but his study guides did not help me at all. I would study early for upcoming exams and I would barely pass it. What saved my grade was the lab assignments, lab tests, and the homework.",0
Hes always late but hes a nice teacher. He mostly does problems on the board hardly used the book.,1
Lane's lectures were very thought-provoking. He doesn't intellectualize but wants you to understand the gravity of the faith we have. Helped my faith immensely. Challenging information and assignments.,1
Really cool lady! I would definitely recommend taking her class. I bought the book and didn't ever use it because the powerpoint covers the quizzes. As long as you have the review answers you will pass the class.,1
"If you're looking for a good College Algebra teacher, take Ms Gordon! She is so amazing! I never understood math very well before I took her class, but now I actually like math! Take her!!!!",1
"Does not even deserve the 1 star rating. Really bad professor, no enthusiasm during lectures, really heavy on readings (20+ pages every class), and sometimes she gives pop quizzes on the readings. It was a really annoying experience to deal with her in general.",0
"Homework is completely irrevelant to the exams, but it does help boost your grade. Exams are straight from lecturers, you're allowed to have a formula sheet double sided but his exams still seem to stump everybody. Willing to help you but he expects you to know everything. You sink or You swim.",1
"She does not care about students. This old hag only cares about picking up her  salary. She is very offensive if ask for question. She deserves a big ""F"".",0
"Very very hard! Try to avoid her econ 490 class! Her 300 classes are fine, but 490 is totally a nightmare!",0
"He is really hard to understand. He contradicts himself during lessons and confuses himself a lot, which makes it hard for his students to understand. He is forgetful and spends most of the class mumbling.",0
Seriously NEVER TAKE THIS PROFESSOR unless you're amazing at math already I don't think he did his online lectures past the first 2 weeks of school he just uploaded the notes and it was basically like a GOOD LUCK type situation you teach yourself and him really he also teaches the most confusing ways to do things he confuses himself,0
"Easy A as long as you show up for class and do homework. I took in the summer best decision I made. Great Professor, totally recommend and I would definitely take him again if he taught other courses.",1
Professor Mazzouri is THE BEST math professor.  He is extremely patient and goes through the problem step by step in a way that is easy to understand.  Take notes because they help out! Complete your webassign homework and make sure you go to class.  Math is the most difficult subject for me and going to every class helped me out a lot! Take him!!,1
"Very dismissive. Makes no effort to answer questions in detail. Very tough/unfair marking. Stubborn/unwilling to make accomodations to help students, even in difficult times like COVID. Uses same assignments each term, so no solutions are released and you can't know where you messed up. Interesting course, but she is not a good prof in my opinion.",0
"She is very liberal and will call you out in front of the whole class if you are conservative. Papers are very controversial. She makes you sit in alphabetical order and bringing materials is mandatory. Basically, you are repeating eighth grade. She makes you do peer review and it is not very helpful at all. I dislike her but it is an easy A.",0
Very helpful. Works with you to make papers as good as they can be. Assignments aren't always clear but he'll explain them to you.,1
Jenn is a real gem! Had her for diff eq and I hate math usually. Her study guides have everything you need for her exams and the homework helps. She gives extra credit on exams which is great. Always happy to help and office hours are always open pretty much. Just make sure you study her guides and ask her if you're stuck on anything.,1
Carol is a sweet lady who cares about her students. She has a tendency to ramble and can be boring at times. The homework was extremely hard. Tests are not so much based on knowledge as memorization.,1
"She was probably the worst professor I've had to deal with. She is an extremely tough grader, when she gets around to grading. Her instructions are extremely unclear and she doesn't tell you due dates. You can't keep to the syllabus since it changed the first day. She was unwilling to answer questions and her questions are extremely open ended.",0
Love Kathy! She actually cares about her students and is very understanding. Offers a lot of extra credit. The classes are pretty repetitive but not hard. Book used for weekly online quizzes.,1
Great class....made adjusting easier.  Uses common sense approach to adjusting.  Helpful in one on one setups.,1
"Would definitely not recommend her to anyone. She gives out a lot of assignments, papers every week, takes weeks to grade them, its November and none of my papers have been graded from the first month of school yet. She goes off-topic a lot, never responds to email, would never take this class again.",0
"Dr. V is the best professor I've had at Carroll. Her Bio 2 class is not easy, but if you study the powerpoints regularly you can definitely get an A. She makes her lectures interesting and is just a great person to get to know. I will be taking her again for a higher level Bio class and recommend her to everyone",1
Not a good grader. Office hours do not help.,0
"Great guy, very intelligent. The comments that call his attitude into question: he can be a little sarcastic, but he never lets his disagreement with a student turn into disrespect. He would speak to me during class breaks; very personable, very intelligent. Recommend as a professor, especially if you can get him in a small class setting.",1
Participation doesn't matter. Not a very good learning class? Wasted time on out class debate.,0
"This was the easiest class I have taken at UNT but I took it in the summer and missed the most important assignment of the semester. I am retaking it and this time around I am actually doing the work. It is super easy and you learn a lot about yourself. Buy the workbook, do the discussion boards, and workbook pages and you will get an A.",1
This class is one of the WORST classes i have ever been in. He is so monotone and boring and he jumps from place to place when hes talking so im not sure what exactly im suppose to know. He also seems to have an attitude when your coming in and out of class rolling his eyes. I would NOT take this class again if i ever had too!,0
She is the worst professor that I have ever had. I was very interested in anthropology until I took her class. I would  suggest taking ATH with a different Professor.,0
"P. Carter is so funny&great! Easy, no homework. Can only miss 3 classes before grade is reduced. He keeps you laughing and entertained. DEF recommend him to anyone. EASY A! Take him!",1
"Terrible regarding grading in a timely manner. Didn't have anything beyond three assignments graded until the very end of October. Doesn't actually teach, just has you and the class follow pre-built questions on Canvas & the reading. No actual feedback beyond a unhelpful rubric, made no attempt to hold any office hour. Avoid at all costs.",0
Not exactly sure why Bushey gets poor ratings? Chem isn't for everyone so rating him poorly because you didn't understand the material is unfair. Bushey's class is straight forward and organized. All the lecture notes are online ahead of time and all of his quizzes and tests follow the notes perfectly. He does a lot of practice in class as well.,1
"4 short message drafts 1 research paper 1,500 -2000words group project revising a brochure 2 in class presentation one with group and one with the research report on a Fortune 500 company",1
Decent teacher. Not the best but not the worst.,1
"Dr. Cheers is an amazing professor! He comes off as tough but he is great if you ""meet him half way"".It doesn't matter if your an honor student, Dr. Cheers will make you step out of your comfort zone to make you better. If you cant take constructive criticism well, or get offended easily,toughen up. He's very knowledgeable and it's a great class.",1
She has no sympathy for her students nor does she care to even respond to your emails or questions about any projects. she needs to relax on the workload ! i had a personal problem and she never got back to me but just give me a 0.,0
She is so sweet and really knows what she's talking about! Not many professors can lecture and make sense without a power point or notes! She made me really like psychology!,1
"Awesome, caring, funny professor. Gives great feedback on papers that will help you pass, and he truly wants all students to succeed. Probably the most available professor I've ever had, he will always make time to sit down and help you. He is somewhat of a tough grader, in that he wants to see his students take their writing to the next level.",1
"Very wishy washy. He will decide one thing one minute, and change his mind the next. Makes you participate in a Global Business Game, impossible..then tests you on it. Even harder. Try to avoid taking him. Pretty nice guy, just not the greatest teacher.",0
"I agree with the last comment - No one bash Jeri! She is the best prof at MU in my opinion. She grades fairly and is very positive, kind, helpful and smart.  She really knows what she's talking about and explains it very well.  I wish more teachers were like her!",1
"BEST seminar, Dr. Tone has high standards but is a fair grader and gives you every opportunity to do well in class. Read, go to class, speak in seminars and you will not only do well but will learn valuable skills for academic research and writing. One of the best classes I've taken at McGill.",1
"I never thought it would be possible to laugh so hard and learn at the same time.  This guy should be a stand-up comic.  Also, he has a nice body!  The added bonus is you'll learn alot in his class!!",1
Solid Prof. Lots of reading and decent amount of writing/discussion. Is able to make dry topics engaging. Great class if you have a decent amount of B.G. info about the bible.,1
"Very smart and helpful professor. Always available to help out. If you go to class, and actually try plus his help you will most likely pass with an A.",1
Prof. Kim decided to make it so that the only way to view his lectures was to see them live. If you are an international student do not take this class due to time zone problems. If you are a domestic student still avoid him because his refusal to upload is a clear sign of being an egomaniac who demands your presence to pad his fragile educator ego,0
"This professor is a very hard grader, points are taken off tests because of not writing parenthesis, or an equal sign. He is very disrespectful, the very first day of school he told us he was only trying to help and that we could look at him as our favorite grandpa, three weeks later he refused to answer questions. PLEASE DON'T TAKE HIM!!",0
Pretty solid professor for Systems Analysis. Overall the class isn't too difficult. The first half of the semester is pretty frontloaded with a lot of work but it's so you can work on your final project. Would take again.,1
English is not his first language which wouldn't be a problem if he spoke loud and clear which he doesn't. You literally have to sit in front to hear him and you'd be lucky to understand. Very Disorganized. He forgets to teach the tricks in his trick questions. Would never take him again. Avoid like the plague.,0
I didn't believe the rumors I'd heard. I should have. Flee this class. You're still reading. Flee I said!,0
"Prof Amitava Dutta is very knowledgeable about his subject, he cares about his students, he responds his emails very fast and his YouTube video is very helpful. Don't expect to get an easy A, you have to work hard and you will learn so much like SQL, ER using Visio that is related to your future job.",1
"Terrible class. Prof is passionate about his own research, but is otherwise very monotonous and lectures regurgitate the textbook exactly - didn't even study lectures for exams, and skipped a bunch. Put in groups of 5-6 for projects that could have been done with 2-3 people tops. Most people just end up sitting around. Vague with instructions.",0
"Literally the most boring professor ever. Everyone falls asleep in class and the absurd amount of homework you have with the most extra essay criteria is really annoying. If you really need the class for Hub, it's good to take because the class is not hard. It's just a lot of work and wanting to cry listening to his lectures.",0
"Although he's not very clear with his instruction, he's an easy person to approach and he takes the time to clearly explain things if you ask him for help. The class is long but managable.",1
100% best instructor Ive had at A.C.,1
Worst teacher I have ever had. He does not help much when asking for feedback. The test a very difficult because of the abundance of information needed to learn in a short period of time. Very wishy washy with extra credit and quizzes in between other Chemistry class.,0
"I've taken this class three times, and have had two drop twice due to personal health matters. Mrs. Johnson is honestly one of my favorite professors that I've had thus far. Her class is very interesting, however it does cover multiple touchy subject in which she approaches with respect and facts. Even though I passed this class, I would retake.",1
Very interested in correcting grammer and writing style and skills.Marks off for everything and she expects perfection even though she does not live up to her own standards.If you can take the class with another teacher I would do so.Good luck!,0
I took Perez for Race and Ethnicity and it was good. It was a 500 person lecture hall but I was lucky enough to get an awesome TA (Frank Perez). Going to lecture was long but still really cool to listen to Perez lecture. There is also a couple quizzes and they're all spread out. Your main grade is in the discussion class. I definielty recommond!,1
Dr. Strait is one of the best professors I've ever had. He has the best stories and never ending knowledge of music.,1
I can honestly say he is a wonderful professor. Me being an essential worker and taking this class during the summer Mr. Weiner was available for any question that I needed answered and I am thankful for his help and guidance.,1
"Papageorgiu is amazing! I highly recommend him! He will assist you with any questions you have, and he is hilarious.",1
"Professor McKean is my favorite teacher that I've had - ever! This was my first semester at LBCC, but I've taken lots of classes at other schools previously and he blew them all away. McKean motivates his students and always helps you to see where you can improve. You actually learn applicable skills in his class - and it's fun!",1
Quite possibly the worst professor I've taken at Rutgers. Took him last year for  Research Methods and thought that it was just the class that I didn't like. He ended up teaching this class last minute and has never posted a syllabus or graded assignments from two months ago. Makes jokes at the expense of any student with a different opinion.,0
worst proffesor i have ever had do not take music theory if you were never in band,0
"Nothing. Not only did she give me attitude on the first day of the semester, but also falsely accused me and a classmate who is also my best friend of cheating on an exam, by asking us what's up about our scantrons in front of the entire class. I have never felt so humiliated and disrespected by anybody like this ever.",0
No Comments,0
"he is a great professor. He really wants to help his student understand and learn. He works with you. Trying and understand the concept is important even if you got confused a bit and got the wrong answer. He will give you some credit. UNDERSTANDING, HELPFUL,  & PATIENT !",1
"Really great class, I actually learned a thing or 2 and would recommend it to everyone. There are only 3-4 exams but she provides a study guide. There are 4 speeches but theyre all really easy and she even helps with the outlines during her office hours.",1
"She's a super nice professor and the content is somewhat interesting. The only problem I had was that she treats an intro class like it is the only class you have and gives you a crazy amount of work. If you like philosophy and want a lot of readings and assignments, then this is the class for you.",0
We all know who wrote these reviews!! Scroll down for the real ones. At one point she even asked students to write them.,0
Not such a great experience. Dont recommend,0
"I took this because I am a nurse and feel it's important to be educated on social problems. He only focused on the perspectives of sociology, never actually ""taught"" anything. Discussion boards were all opinion based, but still never able to get full credit. Unless you are majoring in Sociology, I would steer clear of this professor.",0
"I do not recommend anyone to take him. It is so incredibly difficult to understand him. I have to rewatch the lectures multiple times, and sometimes I still don't understand what he is talking about. If you actually want to learn something, stay away from this prof. I dread attending the lectures, it irritates me that I am unable to learn anything.",0
"Dr Lorimer is incredibly sharp. The Museum Methods class may seem like an easy A, but she pushes you to go beyond the minimum effort. ",1
"Thad is probably the best teacher ive ever had. He makes hard concepts relatable to things in your own life which made bio 21 an extremely beneficial and pleasant experience. Nicest teacher ive ever had, all around just a genuine guy. would definitely recommend this professor!",1
"Excellent professor! Dedicated to your education, wants you to LEARN & understand, not just memorize concepts. Very basic econ. Minimal book use. Flashcards highly recommended.",1
Horrible. Avoid her if you can. I promise there are better communications professors. She could use some brushing up on communications since she's so horrible at it. Didn't teach a single thing. All student based and forced discussions on zoom.,0
"Mrs. Fountain is a super nice teacher.  Although you have to work for your grades in there, she doesn't give unfair grades.  She is very good at keeping you interested during lectures, and she will help you with your speeches if you just ask for help.  She wants you to make a good grade, but she won't give it to you if you don't deserve it.  ",1
Sociology what? Is there such a science? Don't know cause I didnt learn anything.,0
nice guy but not a good teacher. His lectures are boring and very confusing. Does more explaining theories and ideas rather than doing example problems. Tests were very difficult with the average between a 40 and 50%. I do not recommend this professor.,0
Thomas Flowers is a nic person his only downside is he gives to much homework lecture heavy his work is hard and homework is to it takes six hours to complete his homework assignment the work load is to much for a Beginnings class lots of reading I hop this was helpful,0
If you really want to learn calculus and are willing to give your time  Mrs. Liu will meet with you and help you understand.  She provides an awesome final review for the online course. Highly recommend her.,1
"PLEASE, when you see her name -SKIP IT. She will fail you even if you try hard. She will call you out on things and will make you feel uncomfortable in front of the class. She is a horrible proffesor, she does not know how to teach to treat her student. DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND DON'T TAKE HER",0
TERRIBLE professor. He is very cocky and the entire class is about his life. He does not use power points or study guides and the test are all essays based off of his random opinions. Avoid if possible.,0
"Great instuctor. Easy to follow. Gives slideshow handouts for notes and printouts (prepunched for a binder) of sample programs found in the book, and then teaches on those.  Gives some extra credit, and is very helpful when you have problems.",1
"He's pretty redundant. Not much of a help, pretty much just a burned out bum.",0
"is making an effort now, but her way of interacting with the class at the beginning of the term was very negative. I like the material but i'd suggest not to take this course as an elective, you won't get a good mark with this prof",0
One of my favorite professors. Loves his job and his students.,1
Wow I took African-American Art and it was a complete waste of my time. Gelburd makes this class difficult since she grades like everyone is an art major.  She is no help in any way and doesn't care about her students at all.  Her scratchy voice gives me migraines and I'd rather fail than have to sit through her class for another year,0
"Amazing professor! Loved the lectures and discussions we would have in class. He is  not your basic professor that puts you to sleep when he speaks. You will be very engaged and want to be involved in the discussion. Grading is straight forward, do your work, and study! Make sure to do all assignments before the exam, they will be on there!",1
I absolutly love her. She is the easiest professor ever. It was an honor to be in her class.,1
"Impossibly hard grader.  1 credit class with 100 points, took off 3 points because she saw me talking in class (3 points = 3%).  She has no sense of fairness in terms of grading and will go out of her way to ruin your grade.  Avoid this teacher.",1
"Going to class is helpful. The subject was interesting and the homework was very doable. Every exam you are allowed a full page of notes both front and back. The exams weren't that hard, but sometimes those questions you get wrong could cost a lot. If you're consistent with points you'll do just fine.",1
"She isn't very helpful, and (in my class at least) often refused to explain problems or questions because she was always in a rush. She would write it out but never explained how she DID the problem. Very frustrating. She grades fairly harshly, but she's a pretty friendly person to just chat with after class.",0

Prof. Zeman is the best.  She gives handouts and her tests are on what she taught. She answers all questions and always helps if you have any questions or issues.  I highly recommend taking any of her courses.  I'm taking her again for micro this summer.,1
"This was the third course I chose to take with Dr. Masud. He is the best teacher I have come across at postsecondary level. He does not only teach Ethics but practices it as well,",1
"She is friendly and to the point.  If you do the work, you will get the grade you deserve.  This is not a ""cake"" class.  She has real life experience that relates to the coursework.",1
"Ive been doing great throughout the semester, but then he has had us study our two last assignments and study the answer key. The 50% midterm was based almost entirely on those two assignments. Frustrating that if i didn't understand something after doing well consistently i will suffer heavily for it.",0
"I have heard good things about this professor before I took this class. He is an awesome person, but this class needs another professor to teach it! Avoid him at all costs for MIS 300. His lectures (which are fun and interesting and very much off topic) on powerpoint DO NOT MATCH what he tests on. Study the text, have a friend sign you in. Easy A!",0
McGurr is boring but pretty straight-forward with regards to exams and homework. Gives good study guides and extremely helpful homework sessions.,1
Went over many techniques for photoshop. He lets you record. Gives plenty of lab time. If you missed something he will definitely help you and repeat himself. Super nice.,1
"Tom is the reason my writing has improved and it has shown through all of my classes. He cares a lot about his students and wants them all to succeed. He is a tough grader, but always comments on what you need to improve on. SOC 206 has been the hardest class I have taken throughout my college career, but I would have not have had it any other way!",1
"Extremely clear, honest and fun Professor. Teaches the basics and beyond. A Professor who really challenges his students to think. I would definitely take another one of his courses again.",1
I have never failed/dropped a course in my life... except his.,0
Science Methods for Elementary Teachers is one of the best and most practical classes I've taken at Cornerstone. We teach real kids and I learned a lot that will help me in the future!,1
"Do not take this class whatever you do. If you want to learn calculus you are better looking at youtube tutorials than learning it here. If you do not spend 5+ hours studying the homework (Given every 2 days) then you will fail the class. If you do take Eran Makover, Good luck!",0
"Course went smoothly. Try to pay attention to participation during the weeks - that will help on exams questions that involve using decryption methods.  Grading based on participation - easy, two short papers (5pg) - easy, PGP project - easy, Midterm & final exams - hard. But I woule take him again. Ask questions - he will help!",1
Unclear about class he's teaching & unorganized.,0
"I thought this class was hard, maybe because I didn't understand his teaching. Don't take him, he is a jerk. He is always right...according to him. He failed everyone in our midterm because we didn't have enough detail, I wrote paragraphs for each question!! Anyways, don't take me.",0
This class by all means is horrible. Quizzes are very strict down to the point of accuracy. She gives out a lot of reading so be prepared to be overwhelm in reading. Her class lecture is very heavy on details and all she does it talk and talk. Not very engaging nor does she impact the class. She's very bad at teaching to be organize while she's not,0
"Melissa is the saint of all saints, highly recommend taking her class if at all possible.",1
"Jenneke has made me really appreciate the Dutch language. Pay attention in class, take notes. The listening quizzes were the toughest part for me. I missed quite a lot of class and Jenneke was willing to work with me through it. A very generous, kind, and adorably Dutch teacher. Id recommend taking this class!",1
"Tina is such a great professor! I was terrified of public speaking but she made it a safe place, all of us were super comfortable with each other after a couple of weeks. She made lectures super entertaining and fun! She offers 100 pts of extra credit, you can literally bump your grade by a whole letter grade.",1
I took her online course and everything was easy except her papers. I had to work hard on my papers to get a good grade on them. Just make sure you follow her grading rubric. Most of my error came from grammatical errors. I did learn a lot from her class. She does take a bit to grade her stuff usually its the papers. Overall its a good class.,1
"If you are not already fluent in Spanish, you will not learn with this instructor. This class is very difficult, do not let ""beginning Spanish 2"" fool you. I am fluent in Spanish and got an A, but my classmates who weren't struggled very much. he ""teaches"" too fast and doesn't allow enough time for a subject to sink in before moving to the next.",0
"Annoying, arrogant, and generally not fun to be around.",0
"Dr. Swint is a very good teacher. He is pretty funny and his classes almost always hold your interest. Attendance is important, and taking good notes is also important. And he's on Twitter!",1
She is indeed rude on email. Everything is online. You study by yourself and take the exams online. The Examity she used doesnt work sometimes. And I missed the midterm for some tech issues. Not recommended!,0
She is awful. I took her for Soc201 and there was one test worth 49% of the grade. She takes forever to respond to emails and is not understanding at all even if youre a good student. She overcomplicates concepts and moves really fast in class. She does not care if students succeed. Do not take her class if you can help it.,0
Professor Laucella is honestly one of the best KSU 1101 teachers I think you could have. She doesn't really ask much of you. 1 easy quiz based on textbook chapters. 1 project. 1 midterm. Final was a super easy essay. Go to class bc you will get points taken off but I missed some days and still got an A. Participate and class will go faster!,1
overall the material is great but unfortunately this guy does not have the ability to provide an example and clarification to the class. Hw is copy and paste which he will provide to you and during the exam he doesn't care whether you're cheating or not as long as your near the average or above the average you'll be guaranteed an B past exams need,0
Buhler will work you to death but in the end you realize that you learned more from him than everything else you did with your undergraduate career. Almost everything that makes me a strong computer scientist I learned from this guy. And his stories are great.,1
"The better professor's class was full so I had to take Felber. She is a very strict grader. I'm a senior and have never encountered such harsh grading. Sociolinguistics can be a challenging subject. Don't add to that difficulty a teacher who subtracts points for petty, nonsubstantial reasons. If you must take the class, choose someone else.",0
"Most of the coursework is the workbook activities and discussions. There are few assignments youre being grades on, which makes it easy to do them on time but if you dont do them your grade will suffer. The quizzes are fairly easy as well, so overall the class should be easy to get a good grade in.",1
"This professor is very knowledgeable, but she spends SO much time discussing diet/food topics that are unnecessary for this specific course. Because she spent so much time going on tangents about nutrition instead of delving deeper into our A&P topics, I didn't gain much from her lectures. The class is an easy A, but you won't learn much about A&P.",0
"She is the only one who could teach me stats and make it seem easy. Her workbooks are so helpful and she knows how to teach. Just go to class and do the homework. Stats sucks, but she makes it easy.",1
Nice guy but terrible teacher. Learned absolutely nothing from this class and after being a deans list student for 1 1/2 this man was the first to prevent me making it. Quizzes and test are nearly impossible and this class will hurt your GPA. You've been warned! Normally don't leave reviews but I don't want anyone to suffer.,0
"I've never had a professor who cared about attendance as much as Prof. Shimizu (don't call her Celine) does, seemed like it was the only comment she'd ever make. (I wanted the online class for a reason but w/e).  Some readings were interesting but others seemed unnecessary.  Everyone was confused from what she wanted from us.",1
"I enjoyed this class, I would recommend taking this professor . A lot of homework assigned through MyLab, but she opened all tests, quizzes, and homework on the first day of class and allowed us to work at our own pace throughout the semester. She also offered a lot of extra credit opportunities.",1
Prof. Tompson is the best!!! Absolutely loved PS101 :) Very funny and helpful during office hours. She really cares for her students and wants them to succeed.,1
"Susan is all over the place in her lectures both in class and online (has in class lectures with her previously). She answers questions very broadly and confusingly, she just wants people to laugh at her jokes and be her friend. It is hard to communicate with her during online classes, she is very selective when replying to emails.",0
Her class is really tough. Lots of assignments. The grading criteria is not clear at all. Don't expect to get an A. Very unpleasant learning environment in her classroom. Does not know how to teach. Bad teacher. Avoid her if you can.,0
"Honestly, the only thing that really killed me was the final. There was so much information to study it was unrealistic. The teacher seemed really nice, though It was an online class so it's hard to really tell. But yeah, there's a lot of reading and a lot of information. Don't think I would recommend it.",0
"Ning can barely understand a word you say to him. If you're looking for clarification on anything your only recourse is to ask your classmates, or pray that he understand you on accident. On top of the language barrier his understanding of the course material doesn't seem that great either. I had him for Intro to Programming btw.",0
"she gives a lot of work like assignments, her lecture is good, the exams are the way to difficult and she is difficult to approach",0
He might be pushy but he makes the class fun,1
"He was tough for me as I did a lot of self teaching. I would take him again only because I know how he works now. 8 Chapter quizzes and 3 exams are the only grades in the book so that makes it tough. Be ready to spend all of your time on MyMathLab - that part was hell, but he relieved us towards the end. Mainly all online",1
"Horrible teacher, easy tests. Don't take if you actually want to learn/are a business major.",0
"Erik Riverson is awesome! He cares about his students and is responsive to emails. He's very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the material and he makes the classes interesting. The course material isn't always easy, but he makes an effort to promote understanding. Really happy I took this class an would definitely take him again.",1
"Although she's a really nice person, I would never take her class again. Lectures are very boring and all over the place. If you miss more than 2 classes you can't take the exam except attendance doesn't even count towards your grade. Her assignments were unusual and guidelines were vague. Would not recommend.",0
"Professor West is passionate about what he teaches. He believes in helping everyone pass and is always willing to help outside of class. Attendance is crucial! He covers a lot in one class and if you miss a class you will fall behind. But even then, if you make the effort to seek his help, he's always there to offer it.",1
"She is the worst professor i had in my life the worst in UBC so far. Unorganized the explanations are totally unclear. The grading criteria and feedback on midterms is confuse as hell. The tests are not abou the lecture. My course is Algae, fungi and bryophites the finals were about Corey Bradshaw's presentation that, and about the whole eukaryote",0
"Fantastic, kind instructor. If you just go to class and do myspanishlab, you are almost guaranteed an A. She is especially helpful if you want to talk to her and very willing to offer any advice you need. FANTASTIC instructor!",1
She is very good not an easy A but it is possible,1
A very nice teacher!!,1
Great professor.  He gets right down to business. Be sure to stay for the entire class...he checks role at the end of the period. ;),1
His class is informative and interesting. He uses real-world experience and examples to help us understand what the book is trying to teach. Tests are open book as well.,1
"This class was good! I enjoyed it. The professor is very nice and understanding. Make sure to attend everyday, attendance matters! She lets you use the book during exams, & assignments are a piece of cake (just make sure youre doing them how she exactly describes she wants them!)",1
Will read ninety percent of poets and one or two outside novels for any given period and tested on all of it.,0
"Fantastic, compelling woman.  I think the students who rate her low do so because Mary raises issues of race and class, and those topics make some people uncomfortable-especially in the direct, thought-provoking way Mary discusses these things.  If you're willing to open your mind, you will learn so much. Mary Layoun is an incredible teacher.",1
"Dr. Ranft is by far the least caring professor I have ever taken. He didn't show up for half of the semester and when he did, he gave incorrect, confusing examples and went on irrelevant rants. He purposely added confusing wording to questions and was not fair in hearing students' concerns. You'll never get him to respond to an email either.",0
"If chemistry and mathematics are not your strong suit, I wouldn't recommend him. He is very smart in his field, but with that comes skipping the work and math in problems. This course is very math based so it does take some patience and practice to get a good handle on it. He is very good at explaining reasoning and theory which is helpful!",0
A top-notch professor! She was completely knowledgeable in the field and the clicker tool sharpened my listening skills beyond belief (and was fun too!)! I was totally interested and NEVER bored in this class! DO NOT believe any negative comments posted about her. Her teaching style is untouchable! Only regret: she only teaches one class at RIC!,1

Do not take his class. Avoid it at all costs. The MLSC actually has their own sections just for students in his class because of how hard he is. He's different from every other professor at OSU in terms of homework and tests. Homework is very tough and grades it hard. Also tons of pop quizzes and a quiz in the first week worth 9% of the class.,0
"She's uninterested in helping students & ambiguous in all of her communications. She will berate you at her discretion without taking the time to understand your communication. She's a terrible professor who takes ""jumping to conclusions"" to a whole new level. She grades inconsistently. I learned nothing from her class; it's all busywork.",0
"She does not like to teach, every class is review. She rather give tips and then expects you to pass on your own.",0
"I think Professor Wolverton is a really great professor, but her teaching style is for a very specific student. I love history, but she lectures using ONLY HER NOTES AND A CHALKBOARD, and for me personally that was super dry. The feedback on papers/exams was minimal, study guides she gave out were good, readings were dense/long.",1
So nice and friendly. I hope she teaches other classes I need.,1
She was a super good first professor to have coming into WVU the work isn't too challenging and if you need any help you can get plenty from her.,1
"Online class is dreadful. She has no concept of design and should not be labeled as such. Does not give you the freedom to make an up to date website. Instead, she insists that your site be straight from the 90's. Class is unorganized. Rude when helping. Thinks you should already know. First web class was ok. This one is not.",0

"She is just Amazing overall, the class lectures are very interesting an you learn a lot base on her experience. 1 Mid-term (open book) and 1 final which was a paper.  she is super adorable I would definitely take her again.",1
"Worst professor I have taken at UCD. Her tests are very subjective, and she's a tough grader. You can literally rebuttal every question on her test. She has a horrible memory, so make sure you don't ask her to repeat herself (because she forgets). She is also very rude, HATES when people walk in late, and gets distracted easily. Avoid her!!",0
"Costanza is a truly nice and genuine guy. We used our textbook once a week to complete a study question in class with a buddy. I took the class with a friend and shared the book. I made a B+ but only because I missed notes prior to one of the 3 tests we had. Good teacher, good guy. Reminded me of Ned Flanders from The Simpsons, in a good way!",1
Amazing. offers learning test to get to know your personal learning style. Draws Pictures and labels systems. emphasizes test material. extremely Supportive.  Its her passion and she was born to teach! I left feeling comfortable and confident. I wish all my teachers were like her. ,1
"I absolutely adored Sandra Orser, she definitely gave me my love for English! However, she is forgetful but she is very accommodating if you have any disability, or mental health issues. I think she is a fair grader. She gives you options to use the stories that she talked about in class for assignments but tend to mark harder.",1
"Nice guy, but GOD does he grade hard. If it was in person I would collapse from the work load. It's worth it because I learned the material. Like learned learned. Online is super flexible, doesn't mandate attendance. If you do the homework on pace, use it for the weekly quizzes, & use the textbook, you'll get an A. He drops 3 lowest.",1
"Mrs Bolt is not a teacher you want to have for an online class. Only responds M-F to email, good luck if you need to reach her otherwise. She expects a lot of homework and there are lots of different due dates. Tests are open only Sun-Wed, and most homework is due Friday at midnight. I wish for an online teacher she was more involved and willing.",0
"Worst prof , incredibly difficult project he asks us to do without even teaching it properly. Imma drop the course smh",0
late marker. had to self learn course.,0
He was the most intelligent prof I have ever had! His lectures were extremely engaging. Definitely a reading and writing-intensive course and NOT an easy elective. But I thought he helped me become a better writer therefore I am taking another one of his courses.,1
"Dr. Hill organizes the entire class so that you can move ahead or continue along in the module. She loves her job and loves teaching Psychology classes. This was a hard class to take but with the labs and discussions.. this class turned into much more fun than I planned. If you excel throughout class in the beginning, the end of class is a breeze.",1
"She is a really nice person who is very passionate about her subject. She does lecture a lot, but she will slow down if asked. Even after taking a lot of  American history classes, I still learned a lot of new and interesting things in the class. You also watch a documentary in class to write a paper on. Discussion & attendance taken on Friday",1
"It is very obvious the professor does not care about this class. The class consists of reading through a stats book, and doing a homework/quiz assignment out of the book weekly. This is a self help class. The professor is not involved besides grading. He won't respond to emails, you are on your own for any confusion. Don't bother signing up for him",0
Gives homework on stuff he was not able to cover in class. Expects you to get 100% of homework done or he'll give you F on your midterm.  Dropped class & fighting to get my money back which is a pain with Delta.,0
Professor is very condescending and rude. She treats us like we are wasting her time when asking questions. Lectures are 20-30 mins. Never ever responds to emails so dont bother asking questions. If you want to do well in this class just read the book and study the book. Professors lectures wont help and questions are all from the book.,0
"Eran Makover should not be teaching precalc. Anyone who is going into a math heavy major, avoid this professor at all costs. He will give you a test review and the test will look nothing like the review shown. When you asks questions in class about the homework he will confuse you more by answering them. Pick any professor besides him for math.",0
"I really like him. Lectures do drag on a little because class is so long, but sometimes they can be very interesting. He is an EXCEPTIONALLY fair grader and does not try to trick you on the tests. Lots of extra credit to help with your overall grade. Lots of required readings, but some are cool. Chill, laid back guy. Definitely would take again!!!",1
Professor Riffe is a real gem. If you have the opportunity to take her for rhetorical theory or really any class you should. We're so lucky to have her at Charlotte. She looks for the best in you and your work and wants to see you do well. Incredible lecturer. She takes attendance but you wouldn't want to miss class anyways. A gem I tell you!!!,1
"Most boring professor I have ever had my entire life.  I wish I was exaggerating too.  Super monotone, doesn't really explain how to do the HW, reads off her powerpoints, randomly takes attendance, and just not interesting at all on top of the boring topic, extremely picky grader. I only took this class cause it meets an upper-div for my major.",0
"She is horrible. 90% of the classes are spent in unrelated discussions. She waits until the last minute of class to tell us important info, so we end up staying late. She tells you to learn about how to write your paper by reading about it. She is extremely difficult about grammar. She marks off for every tiny thing she can find wrong.",0
Dr. Curtis was my favorite teacher during my first semester at Salve! Her tests are VERY tough but get a tutor and you will get a great grade in the class. This class with her should be mandatory for everyone at Salve Regina. I wish she was my mom because is the coolest.,1
"Dr. Childs was great!  She knows her stuff.  I would read the text and be confused and then go to class and she would make everything clear.  While I didn't like the Aplia homework, her tests were way better!",1
Reads directly off the slides and does not do class examples. Uses Minitab which only people with PCs can use and it is not offered by the school. Teaches coarse through minitab but tests students using equations. Half of the the test is multiple choice and have no connection with statistics. Gives no reference material to help study for the final.,0
"The worst professor ever! Beyond unclear and choose favorites . she keeps you the full double period. When you ask her for help, you a have to harass her for it. Homework readings every week and well as a group project and big final assignment. DO NOT TAKE HER! She also has an attitude.",0
You need to go to class in order to do well in the class but his lectures are fun to listen to he brings to light elements of the reading that make the class really interesting.,1
Great teacher who keeps the class entertained while helping them remember the material. Gives opportunity to earn extra credit. Study and you will pass! Tests can be hard only if you dont study! I would definitely recommend her!,1
"I thought Ms. Kelly was a great teacher judging from the reviews on here, and even from some earlier experiences with her. I am now writing this review to warn you all to be careful of her. She's a complete ghost after I've sent her a couple emails and even forwarded one for a follow up. Never heard back. I have now dropped her class.",0

"Really, really awful professor. He's intelligent, but not at all helpful, and doesn't really want to make things helpful.",0
This class was probably the worst class I have taken at CSUSB.,0
"She's the worst prof I've had. Sweet but cannot teach. My friend and I compared assignments and we'd have the same answers but one of us would be wrong and the other right. Expectations were unclear, lectures boring, extremely unorganized and if you ask for clarification, she just repeats herself. You have to teach yourself. I don't recommend her.",0
Ms. Smith is really easy to get along with. Listen to her lectures and review all of models she shows in class. The tests are challenging because there's a lot of material to cover. She's easily accessible outside of class and will thoroughly answer any questions you have. One of the best teachers I've ever had.,1
"She is a wonderful professor. I never liked history, but I really enjoyed her class. You should go to class because she takes attendance and a lot of the lectures end up being helpful for projects. She gives extra credit!",1
"One of the best, if not the best, professor I've had the pleasure of taking a class under. Everyone in the class feels she is very easy to learn from. She has a lot of personality and makes complicated material a lot simpler. She's very passionate about what she does. I wish I could have taken more than one class with her.",1
"I enjoyed the class, hated the instructor. She did nothing the whole semester. She put the assignments on canvas and then I never heard from her again the rest of the semester. If you need a class that is more structured with feedback on assignments, she is not the teacher for you!!!",0
"She is an AMAZING prof! Teaches all the material with patience and clarity. She is funny, entertaining and extremely knowledgeable but at times speaks very softly so you lose focus. Listen to all her lectures (they are recorded) and it's an easy A",1
"He seems to be a good guy, but he needs to slow down when he's teaching. He goes too fast and often messes up when teaching. Beware of the probability section of this class! It's very difficult. If the class scores below average he'll give EC on the exams.",0
"The class which stood out was one involving understanding and critiquing others' research methodology. These experiences helped me a great deal throughout the rest of my career both in terms of understanding research, but generally understanding the flaws in others thinking.     And she looked pretty good driving around her little Miata too.       ",1
"Inconsistent grading.  Like seriously inconsistent.  Get's on her soapbox in class, doesn't really let anyone else talk.  Likes to talk about how busy she is, yet this is her JOB. But really, very inconsistent grading, inconsistent feedback and a lot of work with not much in return.  The college of Ag really needs to rethink this course. ",0
Prof Foster after two semesters has become my favorite teacher. There is homework almost every day which is needed when you are trying to acquire the knowledge of another language. What you put into it is what you are going to get from it. Intellectually challenging with creative assignments that keep it fun. I recommend Prof Foster hands down.,1
"Had Professor Abdo for both Professional writing and advanced prof writing. She's an amazing teacher, probably one of the best at UTSA. She's kinda of a hard grader, but you'll def leave the class room with more knowledge than you came in with!",1
"He doesnt teach at all. Goes over the homework and talks about how phones and technology is destroying our generation. Hes not hard to pass tho, just do the work and youll be fine. Id only take him for 304 tho, I wouldnt take him for 401 or 404 because I heard hes worse. Good luck if you take him",0
"Swartz is very arrogant. Terrible professor, my friend had Dr. Liddell and said she was a better teacher. Avoid at all costs",0
"Do you like being confused by simple concepts? Then Glen Spiczak is the man for you. He makes simple concepts hard to grasp because of his spastic speaking style and his obscure examples mixed with his love for advanced physics which doesn't translate to 90% of his students. If I didn't take physics in HS, I probably would've gotten a C or worse.",0
"I had to retake this class after completing it in another program with another teacher and revived an A but with Nella she gets personal grudges and if you give her the wrong impression she will set you up to fail, Im shocked I even passed as she goes back and changes your grades if she feels you no longer deserve that grade. Horrible teacher.",0
"She never explains her project expectations, frequently uses profanity in class, and is heavy on favouritism. She grades difficult to make her classes seem more intense than they actually are. Surprised if she runs her 2 hour lecture for longer than 45 minutes. An easy way to get a good grade is to just go along with her jokes.",0
"She is an awesome professor that will answer any and all questions you have. She is an easy A as long you do the work in a timely manner. I am taking her again for biology 2. When it comes to her labs, she will go over everything with students before. Also, DO THE STUDY GUIDES!! Print them out during lecture and use them as notes, IT HELPS SOO MUCH",1
"She has made so may people i know cry and try to ruin their careers because she has a horrible habit of choosing who she likes and hates. She hates most girls. She has always been great to me, but when she treats my peers so poorly its hard to think she's genuine.",0
Was terribly unhelpful. Never answers emails/questions. Assignments were on material we never learned. The rock kit required for the class was discontinued and she did not adapt any of our content to accommodate those who couldn't get the rock kit.,0
"Only thing I really hated about having her as a prof was that she didnt let us have laptops out during lectures. Overall as long as you pay attention in class and MEMORIZE the study guides (they're basically the same as the tests), you'll do fine. She's not a super hard grader on papers but she has a lot of little things she's picky about.",1
"One of the most interesting class taught by the best professor for it. Professor Michal gets you thinking and encourages you to speak your mind. Though I find it impossible to fail the class, you will definitely have to earn your A. Be sure to participate frequently!",1
"Misurda has the style of teaching being, ""You're on your own"". His lectures are very dry and hard to convey sometimes. For 5 weeks he did his 'slides' on a piece of paper where students would follow and copy notes. Come exam time, he doesn't have them. The class average for that exam was a 60 and our second midterm exam average was a 58. Dont recco",0
"Prof. Nedd is a cool guy and creates a good classroom enviroment. There is a ton of homework; usually took about 12 hours a week, unless there was an essay, in which case i'd say closer to 18ish hours of work, but the graded material is fairly easy. Lectures are good for discussion but his power points arent very helpful.",1
"Focuses on what the student(s) want; gives great, helpful feedback; efficient teaching style. Just be yourself and everything will be fine, and probably kind of funny.",1
"Professor Capper is awesome! His lectures are super interesting but they are pretty long, around 40 minutes each. I'm not sure how he is in person (mid Covid time) but online he's super easy. The only thing you really have to do are watch the lectures and take notes. You're supposed to read the readings as well (no textbook) but I never do.",1
"I took him for group comm and if you aren't working on the group projects in class he is lecturing reading STRAIGHT from a powerpoint presentation. WE AS STUDENTS CAN READ TOO. I felt like I was back in kindergarten... Easy class with some homework, but boring!!! Most of the class (lectures) other than group work is common sense... A drag, beware.",0
His lectures are slow but they are easy to understand. The tests are also not very difficult as long as you remembered what you did for the homework assignments and memorized every single definition taught in class. People typically struggle on the first test but it only counts as 15%. He also lets people do homework in groups which is very useful.,1
He just isn't a good teacher. He knows the material for Technical Theatre but has no clue as to what it takes to teach a class. He can be very rude and derogatory to students and doesn't understand how to teach in a way that students can understand. I didn't have a problem in the class and got out with an A but most weren't as lucky.,0
"Doesn't respond to your emails and is very unclear about what hes expecting on exams ?s and in homework assignments. The absolute worst teacher I've ever had teaching an online class(and I've taken 6 classes no prob) , and supposedly he never even took a class on campus but still can't create an online class that operates smoothly and efficiently. ",0
"This course is a hybrid course, meaning that its a class you go to to simply do work online. MyMathLab helps a lot in refreshing your memory on past techniques and the professor is always there to help. However, he makes it clear that he doesnt teach the material.",1
"An efficient lecturer with an almost postmodernist taste of humor. The clearly defined grading scale, the unchanging format of scantron exams and quizzes, paired with a rigorous schedule with everything planed left no surprise. A solid choice of 435 for the studious, as all were too predictable.",1
"He is a very nice man, will help you if you seek it. However, if chemistry is not your strong suit, take a different professor. He does not provide powerpoints, he just does a bunch of problems on the board and messes up a lot and confuses things.",0
"I enjoyed him and actually still think about him. I had to take Physics 2 with another guy, and I instantly regretted it. His lectures are not magical, but the simple way he explains things made everything clear.",1
Very easy A if you read the texts he gives and do all the papers. Super nice and understanding. Makes topics about social issues going on now. I would recommend.,1
Love this prof! Solid choice if you want you want to learn. Always go to office hours if you are confused because he explains step by step processes and doesn't make you memorize random things. He's really funny too and doesn't make class boring. 2 midterms and lots of homework. and a final. Easy A if you work hard,1
You need an 87% average on the three tests to be able to skip the final; he boasts that he'll show you the final beforehand and you'll still fail. There is a financial analysis project done over the course of the semester and he is very unclear in his expectations. He also goes over the material incredibly quickly so get ready to frantically write.,0
"She is very helpful. Her directions for assignments and projects are simple, but you should always ask her for help when you need it. She was always happy to help me improve in the class, I'm sure she will be happy to help you improve as well. Remember to always practice every day for your speeches, and dress nicely for them. Have fun! I got a B.",1
"Even if you have experience in the real world, this prof wants you to keep responses by the textbook. You think you're giving 100% only to receive a D. Assignment List: 10 Discussions, 3 quizzes, 1 Final, 1 Research Paper (based on non-profit organization), Interview Assignment with licensed Social Worker. Prof gives extra credit.",0
"Professor Lawrence is a very nice man and really cares about each student individually. Downside is his lectures can get a little dry (especially when the class doesn't participate) and he assigns a lot of reading. You don't really have to do it though - SparkNotes is more than enough. Easy grader. If you enjoy discussion/debate, you'll do well.",1
She cares about the students and is rather kind. If you complete assignments and the online readings and attend class then it is an easy A.,1
"He doesn't curve, very hard class... Take his class with caution",0
"Thought I was good w/ grammar b4 this class. Such a nice lady, knows her stuff, but not a gr8 grammar prof. Unless you are prepared to be confused 24/7, take someone else. I was only able to make an A because she is gr8 about partial credit + HW, and projects are pretty easy. Beware of exams and quizzes. Would def enjoy her for any other class.",1
"Before having him, chemistry was a huge source of anxiety for me. Now, for the first time, I'm learning & enjoying chemistry. Grateful to have such an engaging professor. He makes a difficult subject fun & has a molecule of the day to connect what we are learning to everyday life. Tips: do practice problems, go to GSS, ask questions, and take MS!",1
This class by far the worst class that I have ever taken at this college. Be prepared to stay up till 4 am 4 nights in a row studying for her quizzes and tests. I have seeked help from her and a tutor multiple times and neither were help at all. I feel she sets us up for failure. She takes forever at the beginning then goes physco at the end. awful,0
Do not take any class with him. Very boring class and need more time to practice and you should be good at MATH.,0
"This lady does not know how to cut any slack. She wants things done precisely with no room for error every time, and she tends to set unrealistic and frustrating deadlines.",0
"Seems like an easy class at first, however the amount of assigned reading is insane. Little gets done in class, and all the pressure is put on you to learn the material as well as do the outside readings on your own. Lectures connect little if at all to textbook/reading material and is super vague, which leaves you scrambling for the final.",0
No Comments,0
"Oustanding professor!  He was very tough, but he made the material so interesting.  He greatly improved my writing and he always cared--deeply--for students.  He made a lasting, positive impression.",1
"He gives assignments but they aren't graded. Instead, if you did all of the required problems, he counts the assignment as a number of extra credit points which are awarded to you on the unit test. Lectures are awesome! Tests are not over complicated and are a fair judge of your understanding of the material.",1
"Darin is the worst professor I have ever had. He never gave me any feedback on any of the work I did, which makes it hard to do well on tests if you don't know what you got wrong on HW. Very confusing, never made anything clear.",0
"Her first test in bio 101 is just to make kids drop her class its extremely hard, her lab is insane and she makes the midterm harder than the other lab teachers, She is never in her office during office hours, get ready to study if you take her class, take maxwell instead..... Dr. Hinton is really nice and funny but her tests are insane.",0
Prof Engelke was thorough and expected greatness from her students. I felt like she expected us to know the content that she was responsible for teaching to us before she taught.  She ran hot and cold...,1
"This Professor is a devil in human form. She is very rude, with great accent. When you ask questions she laughs as if students don't know anything. She thinks that she knows it all but i am not surprise that she is not married and don't have kids. No one can live with a difficult, rude and heartless person like 'Subadra'.",0
"At the beginning of the semester he seemed really tough, but if you work hard and get your stuff done on time you will do fine. He really helps during his office hours and he wants students to learn!",1
"She is a very sweet person but I can honestly say i didn't learn anything. She gets off topic all the time, she takes forever to grade your papers, she's never prepared for class. She doesn't know what we've covered or what we haven't. Very unorganized mentally. It was very frustrating being in her class. But she was very nice.  ",0
She is awesome and super laid back,1
"I found that Professor Smith was very disorganized. It felt like he didn't have a solid plan for the semester. He's not the best at lecturing, but if you go to him and talk one on one, the feedback and help you'll get is very good. Definitely not a professor I would take again, but he's a very nice guy.",0
"Worst class I've taken at SJSU. Do NOT take this class if you're not a Journalism major. I cannot tell you how preachy and rude he is (especially to this one student in my class). His expectations are really high for a ""beginning "" Journalism class. This class has destroyed my interest in Journalism.",0
"Good lectures, You have to work for your grade in BIO 108 he give packets of lectures and you're supposed to memorize it for the exam 4 exams the lowest is dropped but not the final. For Bio 109 you do the lab and every time you go back to class you have a quiz on the previous lab and he only drops 2 lab. You have to do a lot of studying for an A.",1
"I had him for 3 classes- 135, 136, & 137. As long as you do the work and participate a bit, you'll get a good grade. He gives a lot of leeway because he considers writer to be ""artists."" Inspiring and knows his craft. One of the coolest teachers I had at Palomar.",1
Great teacher. Really wants her students to pass and to be able to do well in the next levels of Spanish. She will respond to emails promptly and will be able to help students in her office hours. Tests are very easy and straight forward. Homework is very minimal and is completed online for an occasional worksheet in class,1
"Read the book for this class!!!  He makes sure you understand the material, but test questions come from the book!  Do all your homework and PeachTree.  If you get full 100 on each of above and maintain test score of 71% and higher, he guarantees B in his class.  He will repeat that throughout semester so students don't stress out.",1
"Talks too much, expects students to learn all of the export/import regulations.  Tests are in the form of essay, there's a small presentation, surveys & a business plan to complete in his class.",0
"The professor gets very political in class and it's annoying. Too many readings, no laptops in class, you need the hard copy of the text. Lots of HW. Don't take this class when you have other important classes that take a lot of time because this professor seems to think she's the only professor we have.",0
Dr. Meyer genuinely cares for his students and makes it clear and easy for students to pass! He let's you know exactly what he expects of you as a student. His lectures are engaging and beneficial for anyone going into counseling. I also had him for CSG421. Both classes were taught the same way. He is also flexible on deadlines and over-skipping.,1
"I've found a technique to deal with prof like these: JUST REMEMBER YOU ARE AT A STATE COLLEGE. Enough said? You get what you pay for, even if cheap college isn't necessarily cheap. It's clear when a prof doesn't know the material they are teaching, but what isn't clear is why they expect you to know it. Input is Output so TEACH YOURSELF in upperdiv",0
"le pire prof que j'ai jamais connu, a eviter a tout prix",0
"He knows his stuff. Attendance is not mandatory, but very necessary, and so is the reading. He is fun, but don't underestimate the difficulty of his tests (Especially if you don't attend/read!). Missing even one class is brutal. Not recommended for slackers.",1
"She's a real cool professor if you have the opportunity to take another class with her, grab it.",1
"Good prof, good ideas, hard to keep up with sometimes. Helpful guy though and generates enthusiasm, Tests not representative of any in class questions, could be vague and grading criteria subjective",1
My OG,1
Words cannot describe how horrible this class is.She is completly unprofessional and dedicated in a cultish way to a belief system that shapes the entire class. readings were absurd and yoga useless. ruined the entire discipline for me. i am ashamed that a university like Duke supports this kind of shoddy teaching. AVOID AT ALL COSTS,0
So many surprises in class. If you take your lab summary notes to Kennedy Space Center or MOSI you can get two backstage passes. Also he has a secret word of the day that if someone guesses it correctly he will record the voice mail in a Jar Jar Binks Voice who is doing an impression of Rodney Dangerfield.,1
nesvig is one of the best teachers i've had. his class is easy and he is a really funny nice guy. hilarious.,1
No Comments,0
"He only assigns two tests and 4 essays, so you only have a few assignments all semester to make your grade. As long as you attend almost every class and put effort into your papers, you should pass. He also never cancels class and assigns a bunch of reading, but it isn't that bad. He is really helpful and a good professor though. I'd recommend him.",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. If you take Stein's class be prepared for no homework (not even optional work for practice), 1-2 quizzes every week, and for him to only lecture about problems he already wrote out. He comes to class with a paper full of work and just talks about it the entire class period. He is a VERY harsh grader on exams and quizzes.",0
"Due to the pandemic and making no accommodations in teaching style or tests, this is the worst class I have ever taken at Missouri State. I would definitely recommend other professors for this class that were more accommodating and understanding due to the pandemic.",0
Mr. Hogan is THE MAN! We are so lucky to have him at this school. I liked the last guitar teacher I had here at FSCJ although I honestly didn't really learn much from him. Hogan is an unbelievable teacher and player. Highly recommended. ,1
This is really a good professor with a very good experience,1
"She rushes through lectures and doesn't really explain that well. She's still a decent professor and you can visit her office hours if you need help. You need to work hard for your grade and her exams aren't that simple. Do the homework, attend class, and pay attention!",1
"Mr. FM is seriously one of the best profs I had. He's super funny and really loves to teach, which makes him give great feedback and willing to help with anything! He's pretty carefree as well so the class environment is laid back and fun. I'd totally take every writing class with him if I could.",1
"Dr. Keeling is a very demanding teacher and does not and will not give you extra help / accommodation when you need it. He expects everything his way or you'll get a 0, while preaching ""grades don't matter."" If you miss a class or show up a fraction of a second late, he'll passive aggressively call you out on it and make you feel terrible.",0
One of the best profs in engineering. Gives very intuitive explanations of the material plus he's funny. We need more profs like him in engineering.,1
"He's a nice guy, but he's not an effective teacher. He is very excited about his subject & is fun to listen to, but his lectures don't reflect his tests well. I think he has way too much info to teach in a short span of time. His tests are way too long. He said he does this on purpose b/c in an emergency you won't have time to think about answers.",0
"Her work is beautiful, but her work is clearly her focus.",0
"Really good class, Dr. Swint is known around the country as an author and political expert, so it's cool to have him in the classroom. Class is one day a week. Good discussions, not much reading.",1
DO NOT TAKE THIS WOMAN'S CLASS. CRAZY AS HELL. HAS A FUNKY ATTITUDE AND IS ARROGANT. THINK SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING BUT DOES NOT. HATEFUL. AND FULL OF SIN!I GOT A 'D' IN HER CLASS. VERY UNFAIR & DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ANYONE BUT HERSELF. LOVES THE SOUND OF HER OWN VOICE. TALKS TOO DAMN MUCH & is to CRITICAL.,0
I absolutely loved Sara. I was so lucky to take her during my first semester just before she left for sabbatical. Super kind to her students and was always super interested in what students had to say about the scripts at hand. A queen.,1
"Very nice and reasonable, if you ever need help she will be there for you",1
"Wonderful lady, has some amazing practical tips for teaching. On the downside: syllabus meant nothing, assignments were unclear until the last minute, assignments required a lot of work, but more than half your overall grade came from finals week. A lot of ""do as I say, not as I do."" Everything she says is worthwhile though, and definitely worth it",1
"He comes off as very serious and a stickler, but hes actually a very kind understanding man. Theres a lot of reading to understand the basic concepts of philosophical theorys. The class is him teaching you the theory through arguing. That may sound exhausting, but it works and made it the only class I wouldnt be checking when it was time to go.",1
"One of the best teachers I have ever had! He gives 'recall' tests and they are pretty hard to pass but only because he wants you to not just memorize things but understand it fully. He is so good at explaining things, and his lectures are extremely interesting, and I am not really a psychology kind of person. I would def take classes by him again! ",1
"Professor Stinnette is really one of those professors that you'll never forget. She's hilarious (especially at 8:50 at night which was a welcome surprise) but she expects you to work hard. Don't think you'll be able to slack off and pass her class. She is willing to work with students and offers help and feedback, which I really appreciated.",1
"She spends the entire class talking about herself and doesn't actually teach the material, yet when it comes time for the tests she expects you to know anything. Avoid this teacher at all costs!",0
"Best Prof ever. He explains things well, and his notes are clear. His tutorials are really helpful. The first test reflects what we learned and was really fair. Definitely recommend him",1
"Listen, I'm not one to dislike many professors, but I honestly really dislike her. If you can avoid Yana Sandlers, please do at any and every cost. Not only did her lectures not make sense, if you asked her a question, she just reworded your question into an ""answer"". She does not know what she's doing.",0
The greatest professor I have ever had.  He is fun and interesting and the only professor I have ever seen break into a Russian jig in the middle of class. He helped me to become a better student and tighten my writing. He is tough but it was all worth it. KQ is a great man and students shall consider themselves lucky to be graced by his presence!,1
Why are they still letting this woman teach?,0
"Bad professor, bad man",0
"Awesome teacher. Really funny guy. The class isn't the easiest, but if you apply yourself and turn in all the homework you'll get an A. Dixie is lucky to have him, he's a wealth of knowledge.",1
Very bad teacher!,0
"Horrible experience for Summer Online. Switch to Canvas made everything haywire, but she's really disorganized and seldom emails back. I basically taught myself English 5 with help from LRC English tutors. People in discussions would knock people's writing and it got really ugly and miserable due to total lack of oversight by the teacher.",0
"Dr. Barber is the worst at grading anything. You will not get grades back until the last week of class, so no feedback until it's too late. Every assignment's instruction is so confusing, and every assignment repeats every week. I don't think I learned anything in this class. I learned how to do busywork.",0
Awful. Grading is way too tough. He thinks hes teaching at Harvord. Didnt care when someone called him out for being unfair. Accused me of plagerism when I only used my own words in a paper. Never posts online. Expects you to have Einsteins memory skills with his pop quizzes. This professor is the worst ive ever had.,0
Such a great teacher. I've learned more in his classes than I have in anyone else's just from his real world experiences alone. You don't need the textbook and he gives you a study guide with exactly what will be on the exams. He is also willing to help you with interviewing and resumes any time you need. Would definitely take his class again.,1
"Professor Yemut is awful. He doesn't care about you learning, he is hard to understand and leaves class early. He teaches exactly out of the textbook and expects you to do the rest. Test are heavy, but he does give partial credit if you do part of the problem wrong. If you work on your own, you will pass the class, just don't expect him to help.",0
She cleared everything up about the whole extra tution charges..,1
Why is she still teaching?????!!!,0
This professor is amazing. A younger guy with experience in the field who teaches with excellent humor and has focus on getting the whole class involved. To succeed in this class simply don't be afraid to ask for help and PARTICIPATE.,1
This class was by far the toughest class Ive taken thus far. Tests were extremely difficult as there were no study guides given and when asked what would need to be studied we were told our 18 pages of outlines. Tests were very heavy as there were only 4 in the semester 2 of which were the final and midterm.,0
Mr. May Was rude and screamed at students in class. Was often missing. And did nothing but recite paragraphs from the book. I would not take him as a professor I would instead take one of the many other wonderful computer science teachers in Maple woods.,0
"Took course online. Have weekly due dates but I liked that can work ahead. Like how it was organized. Class is pretty straight forward. Do the work, get an A.",1
"She is a great teacher. If I had her for an algebra teacher in high school I believe I wouldn't have to take developmental math classes in college. She is patient, she gives great examples. She understands that everyone is not a mathematician. I recommend her class for everyone.",1
"Professor Gonzalez is a good English Teacher. I will admit he is a bit strict on attendance and he doesn't like to repeat lecture. So if you miss a day in class, hopefully someone can help you out. Other than that, he is extremely helpful and easy to talk to as well. I do recommend him, but just make sure to show up to class and do the work.",1
In my entire collegiate career (15 years) By far the worst math teacher ever. Goes entirely too fast for those of us who are learners by doing. Skipping steps is not a good idea for calculus (the algebra is just as important). Be ready to teach your self the course. Exams are nothing like the book or his lectures. He gets a zero from me!,0
"If I could give him more than 5 stars, I would. He actually made this class enjoyable, and I truly liked learning throughout this class. Hes extremely accommodative during this pandemic as well. Honestly, just do all your work, have the textbook with you during tests, follow the rubric of the discussion posts, and you will pass.",1
"This class was heavily exam based , but homework and discussion posts also account for your grade. Not an easy course, but exam reviews and PowerPoints given definitely helped me prepare for exams. Professor Melendez was very responsive and understanding during students issues with COVID-19 and distance learning. I would recommend.",1
"Professor Ayers is a super nice guy and is really helpful. His assignments can be a little bit difficult, but he makes himself accessible if you need any help.",1
"When taking this class, you would have to be prepared to teach the material to yourself. He does not use any power points. You must read the textbook chapters, which are extremely long. His test are impossible to pass, even though they are multiple choice. Additionally, you have to read two long novels outside of class. If you don't, then you fail",0
She is the best teacher alive. She helps when you need it and will stay after class as well. I also had her for chemistry 104 and made an A in there too she is by far the best teacher at Gadsden state,1
"In my entire life, this class is the most toughest course I have ever had.  You need to spend 15 hours minimum for Week's homework. The instructor is very picky in terms of spaces, comments. etc.  Even if you are 1 min late in your homework submission, you are awarded zero points. Will will absolutely have no motivation in this class. Beware!!!",0
"papers are typically 750 words. She will interrogate you which comes off threatening at first but is only trying to help you with critical thinking. She grades toughly and has many pet peeves so write them down. She will relate things back to her personal life, which I liked. Mid term is very easy. You need the book the Longman Reader",1
"Avoid this guy..Worst teacher I have ever had the misfortune of taking a course from. Like the others have said, BE PREPARED TO TEACH YOURSELF! He hardly ever lectures and when he does they hard to follow and boring. He has the students do the homework prior to class and then has the students provide the answers. This guy is in it for the paycheck.",0
"I have ms. smith for anatomy and physiology I this semester. the material is very challenging (not difficult to understand, purely memorization), but she tries her best to give you little tips to help you remember the info and study tips. her tests are hard, but not impossible. i like her style, she has many extra assignments to collect points.",1
Decent Teacher just does not know how to present material in a understandable manner.,0
Excellent prof! Very clear and decidedly hot. :),1
"I started this ACCT class with the very helpful Professor Hegner. She had to leave halfway through the semester at which point Professor Skelly took over. He has wonderful stories that relate to economics and politics, both are not helpful to the number crunching of accounting. He writes illegible on the board and speaks in a low monotone voice.",0
"Great teacher! I had him as my micro professor for my 1st term as a freshman. He made the course very durable and easy to understand. Just as a warning, he gives his exams a heavy weight so if you do poorly on one of them your grade might suffer a little bit. However, even still, as long as you pay attention in class & do your hw you will be fine",1
Strictest teacher I've ever met. Her rules are insane for lab she will kick students out of lab for wearing ankle socks! She also never posts grades so it makes it hard to tell how well your doing in lab. She also doesn't teach how to do any of the calculations or go over parts of the lab before you do it so your left to your own devices.,0
"You would expect a professor who teaches an online class to respond to her emails... Well at least that's what I expected. The course is designed poorly, but the exams aren't too hard. The labs didn't really make sense and were unorganized. Blackboard is copied and pasted from past years and there are a lot of spelling mistakes. Do not TAKE!!!!!!!!",0
"If you don't get an A in this class, you're doing it wrong. Incredibly easy. You will learn a LOT about Philadelphia politics and government. There's really no higher authority on Philadelphia politics than him, whether you liked him as mayor or didn't or aren't from Philly either way. Final exam is a city council budget simulation. NO PAPERS/TESTS",1
She is awesome! She can be a lil tough but like a grandma u will love her. She is so much fun.,1
Most stressful course ever.,0
"She is an awesome teacher. 2 tests, 2 debates, and a paper. I got A's on all my tests and 100% on the debates. The test are easy and multiple choice and the debates are easy. I recommend taking her. Easy A and she is super nice!",1
"He's such a great person and I think his intentions are wonderful, but he is so disorganized and just doesn't teach in a way that is helpful to students. He teaches straight out of the book, so you're better off typically just teaching yourself",0
"he rambles on and expects us to do lab assignments and homework AND turn something in at the lecture AND gives us WAY too much pointless homework. hes never at the labs, he has is TAs do it because he is way too lazy. he doesn't grade that hard, but he still doesnt know how to teach.  he expects us to know everything already.",0
"Professor just reads the slides off in class. He gives lots of study material but he never posts the answers so you never know if you're doing the right thing. The formula sheet that he gives for exams is insane and really hard to use. Ive never been so frustrated with a professor, I have a 3.6 gpa always done pretty well in school but I may fail.",0
"I am an A-B student, but this class was the hardest class I've taken at UCF so far. I was not prepared for the content of this class. I would recommend this class if you have previously taken physics, ad I had not and it made it very difficult for me to pass. Every student did poorly on each test, and the curve is the only reason I passed with a D.",0
This man should do us all a favor and retire.  His class is hard and he rounds down instead of up for your final grade.  I should have got a 2.7 but he gave me a 2.6.  He is the type of professor that looks at teaching as only a job and takes no interest in the student.  The tax assignments were VERY time consuming and worth little points.,0
"Bad online course.  I've taken several at RCCC, and this was by far the most unorganized - poor page layout and LOTS of broken links.  Doesn't participate on the discussion forum.  Lecture ""notes"" and powerpoints are useless.  Tests are simply fact-finding missions out of the book - but not always from the chapter your studying.  Poor online course",0
"I am a medieval studies student. Proff taylor is a hard teacher because he expects alot out of his students.  To the writer who stated that medieval studies is not relevant,i would like to say that medievalists have a passion for what they do and passion doesn't have anything to do with practicality",1
"she's a lunatic, whatever you do, DONT take her class. She's more uptight than a high school teacher. Counts 2 tardies as an absence and 2 absences and she will drop you from the course. Also, she is the LEAST understanding professor I have ever met, she went over on class time every class and made multiple students late to their next class",0
"Parkhurst was pretty chill and rude at the same time. I thought I was a decent writer until I took his class. He grades your papers extremely hard. The topics you write about are pretty flexible, but I feel like if you dont write it how he views the topic; youll suffer. His class is extremely stressful! Please, save yourself.",0
"The worst teacher ever, ifyou see your going to take a class that she's teachong... RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!!!!!!!!!!",0
He ipu ka'eo. It's been over 10 years since I've taken his classes and a lot of people are surprised at my pronunciation. They say the way I speak sounds similar to the older generation.,1
"Mr. Abutayeb was, and still is the worst teacher I have ever had. He kicked me out of the classroom because another person kept turning around and talking, then he thought it was ME he was talking to. I tried to explain to him the what happened, but he just called security on both of use. WORST TEACHER EVER!!! GOOD LUCK WITH THIS GUY!!!",0
"Just show up, and you get an A. That shouldn't be an issue, though, since he's got some nice stories from his mayoral days and brings in a million great guest speakers (representatives, former mayors/councilmen, union leaders, Ben Carson's pastor...). Budget simulation is cool. HW is just signing a statement saying you did the readings. No joke.",1
Easy and amazing Professor. He reviews stuffs at the beginning of the class so you won't get lost. Very nice when you go to his office hour (though I just did once). He will explain some difficult stuffs that he didn't mention in class if you are willing to learn. Homework questions are not mandatory but they will help you understand materials.,1
She may be a little off the wall but can keep you entertained especially when you have to sit in her class for 5 hours. I wish I didn't have to transfer because I would gladly take her again. BOMB dot COM,1
"Ning is difficult, nigh impossible to learn from.  He outright lacks the ability to communicate ideas clearly,  does not set clear expectations or plans for his course, jump from topic to topic while teaching, repeats himself over and over again (and not in a helpful way) and just appears to be doing the absolute minimum required as a teacher.  ",0
"Her online class isn't even a class. It's terrible. She waits a month to grade essays and when she does, she gives no feedback. How in the world are we suppose to know what mistakes we make, if she doesn't point them out? She's not teaching. She just grades papers late with no feedback. She must enjoy killing our honors gpa.",0
"this woman is out of her mind, during lecture she'll go on for an hour about her granddaughter and teach us NOTHING, come exam time, she pulls questions out of her ass about stuff she never ever taught, THANK GOD SHES RETIRING no one deserves such torture",0
"I could say a ton of great things about professor Robinson! Out of all the science professors at HGTC she was by far the best. She was very clear, organized, and straight to the point . She made the material easy to understand and made it almost impossible to fail her class ! I usually get Cs in bio but passed her lab and lecture with As!!",1
"I had selected this teacher for my ECO 2023 but, the first two classes with this woman were enough to realize that she was a lost case for the class. She is rude and arrogant. I'm glad I  trusted my guts and dropped the class. After reading this reviews, I see I was not wrong.  Avoid her as much as you can.",0
"You've been forewarned.  Do NOT take this professor.  Highly unprofessional, inappropriate, and rude. I frequently encourage people to switch out of his classes because of his rude, sarcastic attitude and nasty disposition.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",0
Morely is an AWESOME teacher! Dont expect an easy class though. If youre serious about learning photography and improving your technical skills and jump-starting your creativity his class will do it! Hes tough on you but its because thats the real world! He knows his stuff! He may be a lil arrogant at times but the class is FUN and totally worth it,1
"These previous ratings are ridiculous. She is a great teacher, and she tries extremely hard to help you out. Yes, there are clicker quizzes, but why be in college if you're going to complain about coming to class? Most of the questions, she practically gives the answers. And the tests are easy, just study the slides.",1
You will have a lot of homework if you take his class!!!,0
Professor was super boring in my opinion. Only went to the first 2 or 3 lectures and went to every discussion and passed the class with an A+. A lot of reading for the class but I didnt read a single bit.,0
OK teacher I don't think he's truly a bad person but may not realize the condesending attitude he gives students when he picks on them or they don't know an answer or ask a question. Find it ridiculous at this level 2 take attendence & that actually effects your mark. We're paying his salary so if we dont want 2 show up it's our problem if we fail,0
"She was enthusiastic. The class was super easy, as long as you participated you will pass. I took this online, you either have to put your speeches on you tube or go into class and do them, either way its super easy. Loved this class! Pick your topic carefully, you have to use it all semester!!!!!",1
"I just finished up astronomy with prof Benito. I ended up getting an A in the course.  The material is very interesting and you get to see the planetarium as well as go to Jones Beach at night with the telescopes,  I learned a lot about astronomy which was a lot more interesting than taking bio again.",1
"Great professor! Make sure you keep up with homework and labs. Doesn't take attendance, but still expects you to be in class. She also is very clear with her work and what she expects from students. Very helpful when you don't understand something. I would definitely take one of her classes again! ",1
"He was a really easy teacher because as long as you did the readings (which typically weren't long) and the weekly online (very easy) quizzes, you would get a good grade. He gave study guides which really helped for the tests and graded the weekly quizzes really easily. EASY class but actually still interesting.",1
"Mr Lopez is a good instructor, he is pretty clear on what he wants. The quizes are pretty easy straight from the book. The test are straight forward. Never missed a class with him because he makes it pretty interesting. ",1
"Some of the movies required to watch are fantastic films, while others are unbearably boring but are usually short anyways. If you are thinking this is a class about cinema, turn away now. It takes examples of the setting of movies and goes in depth of the real life sociopolitical aspects of these settings. Boring class, okay professor.",1
"I don't understand how this instructor got good ratings on here. She is by far, the most least qualified and horrible professor I have ever had. I don't think she would even be qualified to work at a McDonalds. This professor not only did not know how to grade correctly, she would miss class all the time, and you never had an idea of whatwasgoingon",0
"He gives extra credit worth a whole exam to replace your lowest score. Like the reviews state 3 tests online multiple choice, easy questions, even if you get average scores, the extra credit brings you up to an A. The discussion board was about the budget due until finals week. Easy A class.",1
"HORRIBLE PROFESSOR. First of all he abbreviates so much to the point of no understanding. It takes longer to understand his abbreviations then what he is trying to teach. Basically you end up teaching yourself. He allows you to bring an outline for the final but it doesn't help much. Overall, its worth taking someone else",0
"Selph was by far my favorite professor of my two years at Lane. His teaching style is clear, straightforward, and never rushed. Although calculus is a challenging subject at times, he made the concepts easy to understand. You could tell that he truly enjoyed and got excited about teaching, and I adored his gentle and kind personality.",1
"I took Calc 2 with him and really should have dropped his class. Not a bad guy but is a horrible teacher. Gave no curve, no extra credit, or even extra examples for practice. I worked hard in this class and still failed horribly.",0
Do all the readings and show up to class. Being in class to take part in the discussion and get the notes is imperative. You will need to know the information for the midterm and final. She is very understanding of time constraints. She cut some readings when we didn't have time and modified our papers to make it easier for us. Very interesting too,1
"Workman is a predictable teacher. Will confuse you toward the beginning of the semester, but once you warm up to his teaching style, you will understand that he is a lovable guy. He cares about your knowledge of the field of psychology and is a pretty easy grader. He takes attendance every class, so show up to class if you don't want to lose points",1
Lays out clear requirements from the students.  You will have to make your own notes from the class. Lecture slides are of little help. Group assignments. Great course content!,1
"Very passionate, felt like he actually cared about the subject. Didn't bs us, told us what we needed and didn't need. Kind of insistent about textbook use but if you have programming experience you probably won't need it. Easy grading criteria, very accessible in and outside of class.",1
I'm taking his class now that he's at University of Michigan and he's my favorite prof of all time. I love that man. He is a real gem. He really cares about the success of his students and is very interesting and just all around amazing. He works to build you up (plus you can rewrite any essay for a better grade). Steve is the best. Take his class!,1
No Comments,1
Great class for all to take. He really knows what he is talking about and is extremely helpful. Also we got house of flying daggers during our exam,1
"ce prof la est malade je vous le conseille vraiment, tres exigeant avec ses eleves mais c'est pour votre bien passe sa vie à aider les etudiants par courriel si vous avez besoin! il est marier haha:P",1
He is awesome because he is so enthusiastic. He catches your attention and makes learning exciting. I wish I could have had him for more than just one module.,1
Wouldnt accept google docs because I couldnt get Word to work on my computer,0
He is by far the hardest physics professor in Kennesaw. He doesn't care if his students understand the material. Overall not a good teacher in my opinion and other peoples opinions as well.,0
Readings were easy. Average on the open book midterm was a D which was curved to Bs and As. Monotone lectures which consist of reading off blocks of texts on a word doc. What the prof is looking for on exams is unclear. Says he wants little to no quoting but you get graded down if you don't use the specific vocab from the reading.,0
"Issues are understandable, but this professor does not take his class or himself seriously. The topics he discusses in class do not provide enough information to answer exam questions correctly. His questions feel malicious in that they are made to mislead and confuse students, while also being highly subjective. I could go on. Avoid him if you can",0
"She knows what she is talking about in chemistry, but honestly she is the type of teacher that assumes you get it really fast. She is super nice but a little unorganized. If you go to her after class she will definitely explain it to you which works better for me since I feel like throughout lectures she would rush.",0
"Horrible professor. I wouldn't recommend her to anyone. She grades very hard on essay, and her intructions are confusing.This class was a waste of money.",0
Do not take her class! if you have a family because she give you to much home work.,1
"I took her course online for Spring 2016. I'm not sure if it's because I took several years of Spanish in high school, but I found the course extremely easy. My computer also crashed while I was taking an exam, and she let me retake it! Most professors wouldn't, or they would up the worth of your final exam towards your final grade. Very friendly!",1
He is challenging but understanding. Homework only requires you to read and make an effort for full credit. The quizzes on the readings are tough but he drops low grades. I felt stressed about my quiz grades and thought I was doing poorly but when I looked at my grade I was doing fine. Its the kind of class where if you try to pass.,1
"Nelson may be a ""brilliant"" author; this does not make him a good professor. Nor an ""OK"" one. His classroom persona/schtick/call it what you will, precludes his engagement with material and students. His classes exude what appears to be a lot of knowledge, but you'll leave class everyday emptyhanded- because everything Nelson does is about Nelson.",0
I really enjoyed this class. Victoria Dixon was knowledgeable and willing to help students!,1
his accent made it hard for students to understand.,1
"Really awful. Extremely rigid on deadlines, I had a family emergency and she called me a liar and I had to miss a big assignment instead of it being a little bit late. She also tried to drop me after I missed two classes, it's school policy but she's the only teacher who follows it. Don't take her class. Terrible teacher. Waste of time.",0
"Chef Haze was never in class! He was either writeng emails or gone while we cooked the food of the day. If we have ?s, too bad! Poor class, poor teacher.",0
This class was taken during covid. He has 3 tests and a final which replaces your lowest test grade. During tests you only have 1 chance to choose your answer and his questions are super specific. You need to memorize over 200 power point slides to even get a 70 in a test. He says to only know the purple words on PowerPoints but that' not enough.,0
Great teacher. Very helpful. Pretty easy. Recommend you take his class.,1
"This is an extremely easy class, but also extremely pointless. None of the information is useful, so she does try to make it a little interesting but it is hopeless. You print out the notes for class so there is little effort involved. Just memorize and know the general concepts for the test and it is a breeze.",1
"He almost never responded to e-mails when he said he would (and being a ""blended"" course (half online half in class) you would think he would. His final assignment had little to no outline and left a lot of students unclear of what was needed. He also failed to give me marks on assignments and activities I had completed. Would not recommend prof.",0
"Mike was my first informatics class I've taken at UW, but has definitely gotten me much more involved. Ended up with a 3.7 which was decent, but took enough out of the class that the grade didn't matter as much. Start assignments early, they are much tougher than the lecture or textbook.",1
"I love Miranda, but there are some things to take note of before taking her class. She has the attention span of a gnat, and having ADHD, it's really hard to pay attention to the class when she herself, cannot pay attention. Also for her assignments (at least in COMM-522) she has left us VERY unclear on what to do. She's hilarious and caring though",1
As a lecturer not that great. Seems like he hardly knows material while speaking during lecture but when you ask him questions during office hours or after class he gives really good concise and clear responses. Definitely knows his stuff just poor presenter/lecturer. Subject material is not difficult. Fairly easy class to pass.,1
"This is her response after she put up a misleading question in a quiz ""Not all facts you are given on a test (and life!) need to be asked in such a way that NO person will ever make a mistake. The onus is on the student to read the question well and think!"" (while in fact, almost everyone misunderstood the question and got wrong answer) What a joke",0
Nothing about her classes are designed to help students succeed. Her online courses are rough if you're also working full time. I would rather do just about anything than take another of her classes.,0
Really helpful! Best chem professor so far.,1
She has a good way of teaching that makes it easy to understand.,1
Prof Wheeler is brilliant! She loves what she teaches and you can really tell. There is a lot of readings but you can still do well if you skim and pay attention to her lectures. She is also very accessible outside of class and I've had so many wonderful conversations with her. She really levels with her students and wants them to succeed,1
"Interesting Course with progressive finish The first 4 weeks of this 8 weeks class were very hard and revealed itself to be a blessing as i was eager to study this interesting course. I spent many hours studying in the first 4 weeks and after the midterm the amount of studying remained the same , however the amount of papers + lessons lessened. Yes",1
Brings up controversial topics a lot. Does not control class when topics get out of hand. Does not allow for differing points of view. I learned nothing new from this class. She is a fair grader but monotonous during lectures and class discussions got way too argumentative. Also homework was not always clear. Should really focus less on discussion,0
"Dr. Nifakis is beyond amazing! She makes the classes very engaging that you look forward to having the class every week. She is extremely knowledgeable, kind, and caring.",1
"She's a terrible teacher. She's a tough grader, very vague in directions and isn't very helpful when asking for help. Secondly, this is just an assumption, but she's been picking on certain students for harder samples during the labs.",0
"Some people don't mind Dubovskiy's teaching style, but I wasn't a fan of it. He came to almost every lecture unprepared and when he taught, he improvised and flew by the seat of his pants. Although he's helpful when you ask questions, he was rarely in his office, didn't respond to any emails, and was all around, a very irresponsible professor. ",0
"Favorite professor. Took him my freshman year 8 am class. I thought I would dread going to an 8am class, but it was relaxing. Grades easily as long as you follow instructions and try your best. The quizzes are VERY easy as long as you memorize titles and pictures. I would HIGHLY recommend you to take him if you can :) it'll be worth it.",1
One of the best professors I ever had. His classes are interesting and helpful. He always make sure that he communicates effectively. Bruce is awesome! :),1
"Barbara is helpful and knowledgeable.She knows how to guide a student and when to step back and let you be an artist. She helps tone down the subjectivity of art, i.e. ""all art is beautiful"" and helps students to create art that they will be happy with and proud of.Spend time on your work and you will learn and be pleased with the finished product.",1
Very rude to her students and does not respect them. She does not care about the success of her students.,0
Her class was alright until it went online. Gave us repetitive group project worked and graded it harshly. Gave us a lot of busy work for no reason knowing we have other classes to work on. Wouldn't recommend.,1
"Mr. Gallegos provided everything he could for students to really explore the jobs within the major students wanted to do, as well with majors for students based on their personality and morals. Gives homework, but its so easy. Just fill in blank get it from book gives you 2 weeks to complete. lectures arent heavy there very fun.",1
Very fair professor. I appreciated his simple weighted grading and his candid way of describing things. Very clear expectations and great test review. Made passing this class a breeze.,1
Dr. Lane can be extremely rude. He's not the worst but not the best. Assignments are easy but pointless. Take class with someone else if possibl.e,0
Dr. Cox is the professor I would recommend for taking Cultural Anthropology class. She knows what she's talking about and she teaches well with providing useful information. She also understandable and caring!,1
Horrible experience. Bad overall. You'll be better off avoiding this missile if you can. Good luck if you do take her.,0
"HORRIBLE ,  doesn't explain anything",0
"Barely uses Blackboard. He posts homework assignments with solutions that are barely legible and some solutions are incorrect.  Dont bother going to class. He takes the easy way out by just deriving formulas and going through theory, rather than doing examples. 65% of the class failed the midterm and he told those with low marks to drop the course.",0
Never got the final back. Infuriating class from start to finish. Takes off points for silly reasons.,0
"Lots of reading, but not a tough grader",1
"Awesome teacher, couldn't wait until class started, had him for summer semester and he was very chill. Easy class, homework can be a pain in the butt sometimes, but the class is definitely worth it!",1
"Save your GPA, don't take Casimir. He's a nice guy and you can tell that he's very intelligent but he isn't a great teacher. You barely hear him when you sit up front and he explains terribly. His quizzes and homework are okay, and he goes over them but his tests are so hard! He always gives partial credit though. Just be safe, and don't take him!",0
"Where do I begin with poor miss Thompson... Boring lectures, shes always complaining about how hot the classroom is, too serious, and she doesn't like when you ask questions during her lectures. TAKE ONLY IN MAYMESTER OR SUMMER!!!",0
"SHE'S AMAZING! I'm taking her for winter 2016(2 days left). By far the best English teacher I've ever had! Not only is she supper clear about what she wants, she willing to help!! She helps broaden your horizon! ENROLL IN HER CLASS!!!!! I PROMISE YOU'LL LOVE HER!!!!",1
"Zank is awesome  well spoken, great sense of humor, and incredibly knowledgeable aboutanything and everything to do about the Southern Levant. I loved the class and I think it's a great course for anyone with any interest in the Abrahamic faiths. It's important to know the history of our worldly problems and this course sets you up for just that.",1
"Super awesome teacher! If you struggle with math, I'd highly recommend her. She's on top of everything, very organized. She gives super detailed notes and will always answer any questions. Just make sure you're able to print the worksheets and lecture notes. Homework is due day of the test, participation credit.",1
"At first when she explain the grading curve I thought she seemed like a fair professor. Then my semester of hell started. She was terrible at explaining physics and she was constantly unprepared. She would blame the students for ""not reading"" the textbook when her examples were wrong. She would lose everyone during her in-class examples. Terrible!",0
"Went into the semester looking forward to having her as I've heard she was a great teacher. All she did for our class was powerpoint after powerpoint (and they are not posted online). She is very passive aggressive, and got angry when students would take notes on their laptops. Won't take another class from her.",0
Prof Allen overall just sucks. He's arrogant and inconsiderate to the fact that this is not everyones first priority and mostly everyone only take his class to fulfill a gened. He gives super long boring lectures that no one understands unless you're an expert in Refugee crisis's. Do not take this class unless you have the time to do excess work,0
"Quizzes are only 3 questions, Exams are 5 questions, each question might have 2 parts.... he doesnt upload grades on Canvas, so good luck knowing what your avg is. He expects too much and you should learn things he doesnt teach, he said you guys are not pets, you should apply whatever tricks I teach you and apply them to what I dont go over",0
"I absolutely regretted signing up for his class. My cumulative GPA, as a senior at UT, is 3.88. Needless to say, I am neither unintelligent nor a slacker, but this class was just miserable.",0
"Well arounded, understanding, humorous, down to earth kinda guy, understands that**** happens so fair with late work",1
"Best Professor i have taken so far. Weekly zoom class meetings, weekly pre-class work and article reviews. Pre-quiz before class and post quiz after class. Do your work dont wait last minute. 2 exams a tad bit difficult.",1
"Manu is the best prof at ASU for COM by far. His coursework take a moderate level of understanding, which requires reading the book and understanding what is going on in the class.. (not that hard). He is so approachable and wants his students to succeed. Makes participation EASY even for an online class. TAKE THIS CLASS AND ANY OTHER HE TEACHES.",1
"Showing up to each & every class is very helpful and he is great at responding to your questions when you are confused whether it is in person or online. ( Especially during quarantine). He is very thorough when it comes to his syllabus, whats going to be expected and what is going to be on the test & exam! So glad I had him as my stats professor!",1
I felt like I was in elementary school again in Tami's class. Graded on organization (I felt like I should have the best judgement on how I decide to organize). She also moved our seats around at one point- I haven't had that happen since high school.  We had a ton to cover and very little time to do so.,0
"Although she teaches a 3 credit hour fine arts course, I had the most homework assigned to me in this class than all of my others. She expects you to already know how to play an instrument and read music. She is rude. Avoid taking this class at all costs.",0
"This professor spews his personal political beliefs and shuts down any students who has a differing opinion. By the end of the term no one would participate in class discussions because he made people feel their opinions were wrong and called them racists, and HIS opinions got more and more strident in favor of nationalism.",0
"For the first two weeks of class he rambled about non sense. Then for the rest of the semester he splits you into groups and you teach the class the book.  He doesn't teach anything. Each group has to present their chapter for two weeks at a time, and once you get through all the groups, you start over.  Huge time commitment outside of class.",0
"She makes class mandatory but shows up late, grades papers late and doesn't help you understand the material well I would not take.",0
"His lectures were pointless and he would often ramble, but I went to every one because his clicker points are extra credit. Other than that your only grades are 3 super hard tests. I thought this would be an easy natural science, and I was so wrong. He can be pretty funny, but it's not so funny when you're borderline failing cause he doesn't teach.",0
"She's very kind. This class is an easy A. Though her lectures are a little dull and  unorganized, bear with it (or just take her online class) and you'll get an A. Do the readings, quizzes, discussions and you're good. ",1
Boring guy. FREAKS out over phones and laptops for some odd reason. Doesn't even let you take a picture of the lecture notes even though he skips through the slides with lightening speed. Attendance is mandatory so you can stare at him just talk. Unreasonable.,0
"Dr. Mike is the best professors I have ever had here at the University of Michigan. I had never really encountered physics before, so I was terrified going into this class. He made it a class that I was able to get an excellent grade in. He goes above and beyond for his students. Dr. Mike is amazing. ",1
"The professor is the worse professor I have ever met. There's pretty much zero practical explanation of the material in class, and exams are ridiculously difficult- it's as if your expected to memorize every little tax rule and condition, as writing everything down on a cheat sheet using the textbook takes far too long.",0
I took her 0314/1314 class this semester. Her teaching methods are hard to understand because she would teach the long way for problems. She teaches you 4-5 chapters every class period and then wed have a test the following week. She provides notes for the lecture and does go over the test review. Shes a nice lady but I would not take her again.,0
He is the best professor I have had in a while. He really cares if you pass and gives you plenty of opportunities to do so. I hope to take him again next semester he gives extra credit and has old test in library to study from I Would not of been able to get through A&P 1 if it wasnt for him. Take him you will enjoy his class.,1
"This class was definitely enjoyable. Lectures end up being pretty pointless because lecture exams are based off the practice test that he provides the answers for. Labs are fairly easy, but you must attend all of them if you want to pass the lab exams. No homework ever. The presentation is easy and easily graded. Overall great professor. ",1
"The class is based purely on what is verbally said. There are no powerpoints or notes she uses. You come to class and you take notes on what she says. If you a miss day, you'll be lost and would have to get the terms from someone else since they are used on the tests. The final paper is a hassle. Coming to class is vital to your grade.",1
She is an amazing professor who is really care for her student and gives a lot of feedback. (Took her in Spring 2017),1
"At times, his lectures can be hard to follow, but if you go to office hours he will do his best to help you understand it. or just raise your hand and ask your question during class, he has no problem helping you through the material while he is teaching it. Overall, he is a good professor, but it might take you a week to get used to his accent.",1
"Professor Tidwell was great! She truly cares about her students and wants them all to be successful. She is more than willing to assist with any questions. We did end up reading almost the entire textbook, so be prepared. Quizzes were pretty straightforward if you've read the material. Follow her grading criteria and you will do well!",1
"Chill in a good way. Doesnt sweat the small stuff, VERY patient!!!",1
SAVE YOURSELF AND YOUR GPA!,0
"Don is such a beauty. He is hilarious and made a late night lecture fun and exciting to attend, even online. He is a great prof and made a math-heavy class easy to understand for someone like me who is not a math person. He made me enjoy finance and inspired me to pursue more classes in finance/accounting for a career. 10/10",1
"This man has driven more students out of ME than all the others put together.  I respect him, but the way you respect a bull when you're in his pasture. Do the homework, ask questions, and if you don't understand, DiBella teaches a night course...",0
"Dr. Powell is one of the best PSYCH profs I have had to date. He is incredibly knowledgeable and manages to make some pretty dry topics interesting. His course is set up in the optimal way to learn, which involves a quiz a week. Anyone willing to read the textbook and put in a reasonable amount of work should get an excellent mark and learn a lot.",1
Professor Hetrick lectures the entire class and not on what the topic of the assigned paper is. Very few people get an A and I consider myself a strong writer. Takes forever to grade papers and even longer to pass back for feedback. Only test is the final. Definitely would not recommend. ,0
"Before taking this class I was worried because she did not have amazing reviews. This was one of the easiest classes I have ever taken. She gives an insane amount of extra credit, lets you use a notesheet front and back PER CHAPTER on tests (4 chapter tests), and has high energy during lectures. I literally had a 104% in the class. Highly recommend",1
Great guy! He was really excited about the readings and you could tell he loved what he was doing which made the class fun. I would highly recommend taking his class!,1
"Emily Bauman is an amazing professor. She genuinely cares for the knowledge of her students. She does her very best to keep people engaged. Her discussion can be interesting. As long as you don't fall behind in the readings, it's really not a terribly hard class. She is also very understanding with absences and personal issues.",1
"AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!! Professor is very knowledgeable about Accounting but because it comes so easy for him he is terrible at teaching it to people who have never done it before. Half my class is confused & at the moment and I am having to pay for an outside Tutor to learn what I don't in class. He does NOT explain things well and goes very fast.",0
So far the best professor I've had at this school. She is hilarious and very clear with what she wants in terms of attendance and assignments. Straight forward.,1
Very boring class. The work you do in her class has nothing to do with computers. She gets mad when you try to ask her questions DO NOT TAKE HER.  She is the worst professor i have ever had in my college career!,0
Don't take this prof. unless you want to have your mind blown. He uses subatomic particles to change the laws of physics in class. He also hypnotized me and made me believe that I was a real student and not who actually tried and did the homework and that helped me get the grade I earned not given. I had to do the work for once in my life.,0
"Incredibly talented and relatable, a treat to have been in her class. Extremely fun and caring. Sparks insightful conversation and loves her job. Thank you for everything Dr. Ferreira!",1
I do not recommend taking this class unless you are exceptionally well at writing papers. You do need the book and he will want plenty of quotes from it. He is a hard grader and give vague feedback. I have received only Cs on my papers. Also the only grades we get are from the paper so if you dont do well on them you are SOL.,0
Please listen! She is a very hard teacher! Anatomy is suppose to be basic but she is detailed to everything! Her exams are extremely hard and so are her lab exams. You need to dedicate at least 40 hours a week to study for only this class. This is only a basic anatomy class and she teaches like a university advanced anatomy course. Don't take her.,0
"This was the first semester she was trying out a new pass/fail grading system (spec grading) and she provided plenty of information in the syllabus/articles/in class on how she was grading. It overall made it easier to get the grade you wanted, however, she wanted the hw/projects to be near perfect to pass which could be frustrating",1
"Notes/lectures on the website. HW and projects get progressively harder. HW eventually strays away from the notes, so it gets frustrating to find answers. Can be rude on random days. Exams are multiple choice. Just study off the past exams he gives. Curve is dependent on how smart the top 1/3 are as 1/3 gets A. No guidance on Proj after part 1.",0
"Truthfully, I don't know how she has a rating of 4.2 here. I work exceptionally hard on every one of her assignments and it's basically impossible to get an A. she gives grades like 9/10 and 15/16, even when you follow the rubric exactly. She says ""great! but what more can you add?"" If you need this course to get your GPA up, find someone else.",0
"patty patty patty, what a woman! she's incredibly smart and i love her lectures. you can tell she really loves what she does. she's super hard, like, over the top hard, but she's just trying to give you the necessary tools to proceed with your degree.",1
Professor Aizura's class structure is pointless and makes it so that you can get a really bad grade by missing classes where he has an in class assignment (20%) and discussion posts (also 20%). It's counterintuitive and he will ignore your emails when you need his answer the most. Class content is interested but the readings are soooo long.,0
"She's really nice, but she'll end up just doing the problems and not explaining much. Even after asking questions she'll do it again. The things on the test can be something taught a day before, also a super harsh grader. Do not take her if you already struggle with math",1
"This woman is THE BEST teacher at JSU!!! She is only rude or blunt to you if you ask stupid questions or act up in class. I'm taking every possible class with her! There is a good bit of paperwork in this class, but it is very helpful and pretty easy. I loved this class and I love Mrs. Barclift!!!",1
"She gives a lot of readings, and she never talks about the readings in class. The things she teaches in class are different from the reading but she somehow expects you to be able to connect the two together whether or not you understand the readings or not. you can definitely see her if you dont understand the class but really dont take this class",0
"Boring speaker, monotone, with no passion. I have Aspergers and have difficulty with social situations. He did not accommodate my disability, just scoffed. Group projects would have been much better if there was a discussion board, forum, or chatsomething to get to know classmates and discuss problems. If I could ask for a refund I would",0
"Mrs. Jackson is a good professor. She is easy going and cares about her students. She gives lots of group activities. Do your work, and get an A.",1
"Yes, this class was absolutely atrocious. I tried twice; both times I got completely left in the dust. Quizzes are due in the middle of the day with arbitrary start/end times instead of at midnight, so I always missed quizzes with no make-up. Complains about students emailing her, but if you have so many students emailing you there's a PROBLEM.",0
Very Very Very easy! Lots of essays but grades easy! Expected to show up to class for participation,1
"She's a super nice and great teacher, she's flexible with due dates with her students and explains the topics pretty well. The class is pretty easy, show up and do your work. The tests are fairly hard but if you take notes and study them you'll be set.",1
"Dr. Shahrava has a very good understanding of what he does and has the potential to be a great professor, but his lack of organization or communication makes understanding his lectures impossible. Reading the textbook will usually save you with profs like this, too bad the exam questions are pulled from concepts in his lectures and not the book.",0
"Very nice and so sweet. Be careful if you're anything but conservative. Her views are really right-winged and traditional. Overall, a great instructor just take everything she says with a grain of salt.",1
"Super Hard grader. The pop quizzes are worth most of your final grade. At least telling students about the quizzes even one day beforehand will help. There was a pandemic going on, and I felt like the guidelines were so harsh considering the state of mind so many people were in. He doesn't think about the students and doesnt grade fairly. UGHHHH",0
"Mike Jurmu is a very nice guy. I can not say that about his classes. Worst grader I have ever had. If you're looking for a class that you just want credit for with an average grade, take his classes. Does not reward smarter students for their hard work, and everyone is within the grade average pretty much. EXTREMELY terrible grading. TERRIBLE!!",0
"Prof. Abdo is THE best. If you want to learn she is the person to go to. Her class is not easy but she is extremely helpful. For those who believe the only A is in her last name, it is not.",1
"If you show up and actually try, you'll pass with flying colors. She really had trouble with using canvas properly (like making our weekly course overview as an assignment) and by the end of the semester, I had about 10 missing grades. Other than that, she was ok, but I didn't enjoy the class.",0
"WORST PROFESSOR EVER!!!!!!!!!! I cannot emphasize how bad she is! I don't know where she came from or who does she think she is but she acts as if nothing else is going on but her own class. Avoid her at all costs!!! I won't be surprised if i don't see her here next semester. For what is worth, she is left with 3 students for the rest of the year.",0
This guy likes to talk a lot about his personal life and likes to retell boring anecdotes repeatedly every single lecture. Apart from being a strict guy he is extremely rude. If you are trying to get your GED done do not take him unless your really into poetry. Also be prepared to waste money on useless books. This man also takes attendance serious,0
"His lectures don't prepare anyone for his exams, but he's a nice guy with a lot of experience",1
"Dr. Falvo is unlike any professor I've ever had before. He is the kindest, most understanding, and caring professor I have ever had. He genuinely cares about how you are doing as a person before how you are doing as a musician. As long as you're open to it, he will open your mind to a whole new way of thinking.",1
"James Cooney gives amazing lectures and really helps you understand the material. I had to go to office hours to get a better grip on one subject, and he helped me understand in a different light what I was learning. He has a good sense of humor and overall wants to see you succeed. If you do the hw/study guides the 3 exams and final are a breeze.",1
Tough but worth it!,1
"She talks for ever in class about the most abstract stuff. Approximately 5 minutes of what she goes over in lecture is on the exams. Inconsistent af, late all the time, exam is 100% based off the book, and you only get a study guide if you're lucky. Never grades things on time. Comes off as super nice, funny, etc. but a bad professor.",0
This professor will make you cry tears of boredom. This is the least engaging class ever . Dean is extremely unorganized - he puts test material on canvas the night before exams and changes due dates last minute. He gives little to no instructions for HW. He cant figure out how to use zoom efficiently to save his life. Avoid at all costs!,0
"The only way to learn is through the lectures, which is hard to understand sometimes because of her thick accent. She gives examples that make no sense and are not relate able, and just complains about how most of the class sucks at the material and she cant wait to get rid of us. The material is not overly difficult but she is not good at it.",0
"Well what can I say , I honestly think he could use some lecture time . If you come to class just know that you are coming for the clicker points and that is it, there will be no lectures you are on your own in this class and the sample exam have nothing to do with the real exams given. Good luck ",0
"I've taken multiple courses with this professor. She is awesome. I had a lot of fun in this class. Just like any other college level course, there are expectations. If you are interested in developing your critical thinking skills and challenging your world view this is a great course.",1
"Great Prof! There is a group project and a single page paper on an article. Marking could be a bit easier. Very enthusiastic lecturer, and the class was pretty easy to understand and not a lot of work.",1
"Dr. McKenzie is overrated. Everyone said to take one of his classes because they're ""fun"". This was a 100 level class but he treated it like a 400 level class and I had to teach myself everything from the book.",0
"Even though her class was easy for me, I cannot imagine many of her students passing. She shoves her political views down students' throats. I figured out early on that studying the 'quizzes' were the ONLY thing necessary for test prep. Don't bother studying notes.. You will pass if you put in the work but her class was a drag and so was she.",1
"Great teacher, but he talks softly so make sure you sit towards the front and youll be fine!",1
"Do not take this professor if you really want to learn. Class was very chaotic, unorganized, waste of time. It is difficult to learn because the class was all over the place, but he does want people to pass.",1
Her enormous ego keeps her from teaching. Her class averages are the lowest on department wide tests. Disrespectful to students. Make friends with other classes; you will need their notes to pass. Almost her entire class is failing. Get adifferent prof. She is the failure!,0
"I took Historic Papermaking and Book Structure in Fall and I learned so much from Gail, and I ended up with so many amazing books and handmade paper! It's quite a bit of work, but nothing more than expected from a standard studio class. Would definitely take again! Gail is a great resource.",1
"Super easy class. Not a lot of homework. Used PP slides most of the time. Easy to undersrtand, nice prof. Would take another class with him.",1
"One of the best teachers I have ever had. I am going to sign up for more of his classes, regardless of what they are.",1
She is very unorganized and unclear.,0
"She is a horrible instructor. She ""acts"" like she doesn't understand you when you sign, and make you do it over and over again. She is the worst ASL teacher at Mesa. She says the students are below what ASL 4 students should be at and says the other ASL teacher are not doing their job. Take some one else!!",0
"Very interesting class, had ""pop"" quizzes at least once a week. If you dont do the reading then there is no way you will pass. No midterms or finals but you have 3 papers to write. Participation in class is a good way to get an easy A in a big chunk of the final grading. Very interesting teacher",1
"I partially agree with the comment below me.  I agree he is approachable, however he really does make the subject harder for me to understand.  & I do not agree with his exam method.",0
"She's very rude to her student and talks to them like we're all kids. Almost everyday she come to teach with an attitude and makes rude sarcastic remarks to the class. Need to go to the bathroom? You'll get told you move too much. Want to blow your nose? Don't you'll be ""too loud"". I've never had a teacher be so rude and uncaring than walling.",0
"If you go to class, you are going to do fine. A lot goes on in class with lectures, discussion topics, and group work. She's experienced and thoughtful with her answers to our questions. I want to take another class of her's again.",1
"Dr Ouyang is very dry. I struggled to pay attention in his class. He knows the material well though, and tries to get us to engage in discussions. The projects were intensive, and time consuming, however I enjoyed it as I learned a lot doing them. He is an easy grader on the projects, however the final was extremely difficult for me",0
"Excellent professor with a lot of energy and many jokes to keep you awake. Thus far my favorite professor in Hofstra, do not be intimidated by his demeanor the first few weeks of school, he's just trying to crack you. He will make a song out of important concepts and is very very inspirational for someone his age. ",1
"Funny professor makes class interesting.  If you attend and do the online hw, theres no reason not to get a A.  Recommend taking the class",1
the class helped with my understanding of the material. the professor has a personality that helps facilitate discussion. with a an interest relating to the topics of the day.,1
She is very rude and reads directly from power points. She will force people to make friend with the others . The class is very boring and is very hard to remain focus,0
"Did not show up for our final speech.  E-mailed us 15 minutes before the final that she would not be there.  We turned in these speeches as essays in a box in the journalism office, and she never gave feedback. Did not give clear feedback for earlier speeches.  When I asked her what I could improve on, she gave vague answers.",0
Lectures are boring and will put you to sleep but you'll need the attendance points. Don't buy the book just take pictures of the pages needed for hw. His study guide is ok however it only covered about half of the exam. The average grades for his exams are in the high 80s. This class is an easy B but you'll have to work hard for an A.,1
"to be honest, although I re-watch his recordings, I still don't understand his English at all for both lectures and questions on exams, so I don't learn anything useful from this class. The good thing is he is an easy marker and his exams aren't hard (due to open book). Unfortunately, he is the only person who teaches 4115, 3225, 3235, KPU IT sucks",0
Her grading is out of three exams only. She does give e.c. but she is very strict on the way she wants it. It's her way or the highway. The first few e.c. assignments majority of the class received no credit. Attendance is mandatory and no phones allowed. Doesn't return exams. Btw 365 is based more on marriage counseling than family psych.,0
Very nice professor. Will help you if you need anything. Tough information that he explains really well - so go to class and make your own notes in the sidelines of his slides so it's clear to you. Tests are based only on what he talks about in class (somewhat hard).  Suggest buying the book online through Aplia (he will explain that) saves MONEY!,1
"He is well planned out. His tests are not easy, but he gives you good study tips/guides. I would take him again.",1
"Course Data Structures and Discrete Mathematics. Fair to good presentation of the material. Went largely off ppt slides, few references to book, although the book was used for homework. Easy to get along with, responsive to questions. Fair grading.",1
Spends half the class talking about herself rather than focusing on important matters. She has a bad attitude. Reprimands students who request guidance through email which is often since she is only in her office for a few hours during the week. She does this because she is not computer literate. Very discouraging to eager students. Awful! Awful!,0
I don't think I've ever had more fun in a class. The rock and roll material was so interesting and she teaches it in such a great way. Shes funny and her tests are amazingly easy. WOULD TAKE AGAIN!,1
"this class was oddly difficult for an elementary ed math class. we constantly had pop quizzes and worksheets for homework, which is doable. but on the tests, the problems were so much more complex than anything we had practiced. the point of this class was to learn how to teach elementary students and i don't feel like i learned how to do that.",1
One of the best professors I've had in PCCC. He takes time to make sure you fully understand the material before moving on to new subject. Reviews before exams are always a giving so you're not baffle comes test time. He is one professor who truly cares about the students....,1
gReaT teaCHer. sHe reaLLy kn0w heR fieLd.,1
amazing. my favorite professor at bentley,1
He is the worst teacher.,0
"Prepare to do a lot of research if you take this class. This professor did provide feedback on the graded work, but even with the feedback, I was still uncertain why some forums were marked down and others were not. The tests and assignments are very time-consuming and work-intensive.  Overall, it was a difficult and frustrating class.",0
"Incredibly easy class with clear cut grading criteria! Amazing and clear lectures: there were 8 lectures coupled with a quiz, 3 assignments that had to be done with a partner, and 1 midterm and 1 final. She provided a study guide for both exams and the week before she holds a review. I would take her again and highly recommend her to anyone!",1
Very bad.,0
"I don't know what all these negative reviews are, this class was very simple. Read a chapter in the book, answer a few questions for homework that are basically directly quoted from the book. The teacher is really helpful and shows you everything. Probably one of my favorite classes and teachers out of all my time in school, no reason to fail.",1
"Class is really not worth taking. Did not even come close to getting through all the material. Lectures are incredibly boring and he just puts up pictures on the board, no actual information. The information he says in class is generally useless. The papers are not long but he grades them extremely tough and it is unclear what exactly he wants.",1
Couldn't understand a thing he talked about all semester. Doesn't help his students. Horrible. He will let you out early but thats about it. You can go to all the tutoring in the world and show up to his classes. Even when he clearly sees your trying he wills till fail you. Avoid.,0
"Very knowledgable, good conversationalist. Holds attention with ease. Not an easy A but you will pass if you try hard.",1
"Class has proctored pre and post-class quizzes. The exams are next to impossible. These exams are a majority of your grade, the final is worth 30%. A little bit of the information is in the book or in his powerpoints. Studied for a week and still barely passed an exam. Knowledgeable guy but awful professor. Take a different science to fill a prereq",0
"Very enthusiastic professor who knows his material, but he flies thru information very quickly. The best things u can do for urself in this class is take notes via computer &RECORD THE LECTURES so u can go back to them if u can't keep up with notetaking. + he gives hints on what's on tests AND explains what he wants to see. Don't wanna miss that.",1
Such an awesome teacher.  Really loves what he does and is passionate about it.  Fun class with lots of learning but not an easy A.  Have to go to classes and an assignment every week.  Essay papers as well.  If your offended easily with controversial topics or language then not a good choice.  Best class ever,1
"Halfway in the semester and all I've learned is basically the psychological effects of breast feeding. Your points come from attendance and tests, which he does provide a study guide for. If you are willing to sit through the lectures and study then go ahead. If not, find another class.",0
"Worst teacher ever. Studying in KPU from 2 years, never dealt with this kind of stupid teacher. Never take any course with this guy. Doesnt know ""C""m of coding just copying code from internet and showing videos. If the teacher is reading, I want to ask how data structure is related to AVENGERS movie budget.",0
"Professor Goldman was pretty dull and her class seemed to go on forever. She was relatively easy, but does not offer extra credit anymore, besides on the tests. You have to read four books, which are not worth your time, but you have to write papers over them. Overall I would've rather taken a more interesting class, but it was an easy A.",1
"If you work ahead and ask Professor Kolluru questions as they come up, this class will be an easy A. She's super caring and will work with you even though it's an online class.",1
He is the most specific grader i've ever had. his lectures are good and you'll understand the concepts but his grading on tests is enough to drive you crazy. You have 4 tests and a final and one of the tests are dropped (if he didnt drop your lowest grade you wouldnt pass). try and take someone else,0
"Where do I begin! This course is SUPER HARD!! Not something you can just skim through and pass, You have to read, do your assignments, tests and pay attention in class to the guidelines.  Great teacher by far! I walked away with tons of knowledge! Hard but worth taking...",1
She's amazing. She really cares about students and wants you guys to succeed. Just make sure to keep up to date with all homework assignments and she even lets you make a study guide for the test! SHE ROCKS! ps: she likes green apples :),1
Took this teacher for MTH112 (which is not hard at all) but this prof makes it sooo hard. Takes off points for dumb reasons that do not even affect the final answer. Always in a rush. Expects you to remember and know all the formulas like you're some kind of Math Wiz.,0
"Finishing up my degree at NOVA so I had to take him. He's by far the hardest Spanish professor I've ever had. Very strict/tough grader and assings a lot of homework! While he cares about his students, he could be very rude towards them during lectures. I normally did well in Spanish, but got a C with hard work. Glad I only had to take him once.",0
Shes easy and sweet! If you stay after she'll help you! She gives out the questions on all your tests so its no prob! Shes laid back but you still learn. Great class!..esp as an elective!,1
"unbeleivable, english is defietly not my stong subjectand managed to get an A. pretty straight foward class if your the kind of student that just wants to show up and play angry birds. she shows alot of videos.",1
She is a great professor that gives you clues on how to remember the material. She gives extra credit which really helps boost your grade. She is more than willing to answer any questions. I got an A but I did have to study for it.,1
Sit back and be ready for open note tests. You'll be aware of what you need to know so its all about applying it. Easy grader,1
"Johnny is amazing, I would highly recommend taking him for any classes that are offered! You can tell that he genuinely cares and wants his students to be engaged. I'm not a big fan of Econ but he really tries hard to make it a class you will enjoy.",1
"His lectures don't really explain the material well, and you're better off looking at videos on Khan Academy. He only grades you on the midterms/final, with optional quizzes based off homework for rounding purposes. The TA's are left to handle non-lecture things, and they've struggled because of the lack of communication from the professor.",0
Dr. Kennedy is a chemistry nerd more so than a teacher. He sometimes expects you to understand things as easily as he does or thinks you should. He is a really nice guy and fair grader.,1
Severely annoying. Treats her GE level History 146 class like it's an important upper level course. Whines when no one participates or take notes on what she's rambling on about.,0
"Absolutely the most amazing teacher, she genuinely cares about her students and their success. She does not try to trick you or make things difficult. She is extremely responsive to your needs and questions. I wish she taught more classes.",1
"He's extremely helpful, and just wants you to learn. If you can show him you read, that you thought about it, and that it made you ask some questions, you'll ace this course. It was interesting, relaxing, and I wish I could take a course by him every semester. So interesting, so helpful, and a great GPA booster.",1
Awesome teacher!!!! 100% would take again. Passionate about what he does and makes class interesting!! As long as you take notes you will pass!!! Gives extra credit so show up to class!!,1
"Amazing professor. Attendance at every class is necessary along with active participation. She has a great sense of french culture and really enjoys it when students put forth the effort to engage. Tests are straight forward and pretty easy. Lots of homework so be prepared to do your share, although you'll only be graded on oral answers.",1
"its hard to find anything nice to say. she is an awful professor. can't use moodle or collaborate. wastes an extreme amount of time in class, teaching nothing herself. very outdated ideas. very unclear, poorly worded instructions. is very rude if you have any criticism of the way she poorly runs her class.",0
"He is a really nice guy, but wouldn't recommend him as a professor. Very tough class, could teach better online, 85% of grade is in exams with little time. I scraped through at the end with a B. Wish he gave more practice exams/material. Lots of people did very, very poorly. His microphone is bad so listening to lectures hurts your ears.",0
"She is very energetic ,and bubbly! She focused more about what we get out of the readings rather than whether you're wrong or right about the reading.She brings interesting ,and fun readings too! Class is all about discussion which I enjoyed. She is a fair grader ,and brings in art related things into the classroom.",1
"He lectures straight out of the book, so I wouldnt bother with the lectures. The tests are similar to the homework. He is a nice man, but frankly, his teaching is awful. He is getting paid to teach, not to be nice. Watching paint dry is more interesting.",0
"Berkson was my favorite professor my freshman year. He is clearly passionate about what he teaches and wants you to be just as knowledgable on countless topics just like he is. Intimidating at first, but pays off in the long run.",1
"Mostly had test and group work was considered to be a grade. She also didn't offer reviews for her class and was just expected to know all of the chapters. I would say her lectures were good, but I feel as they didn't cover everything in the chapters/tests.",0
"Tests are easy if you actually read the book and supplemental readings. If you don't do well on a quiz or essay, don't stress!! He offers TWO opportunities for extra credit. Participantate in the Facebook group, participation is based on how engaged you are with him and others. ",1
"Extremely rude (condescending) to students. I've had plenty of bad teachers, but her level of disrespect is far above any other. She reads off slides created by a TA & HW that is way beyond the scope of the course. Exams are long and confusing. Only thing she cares about are her stories (football talk) during the 1st 30mins. Don't take if possible.",0
"This guy is a joke of a teacher. He took us on a mandatory field trip that was suppose to end at 5pm, but due to his own inability to schedule properly, forced us to stay until 9pm. Other things are his over sensitivity to being challenged. He is not understanding at all either. He's gone downhill in the last couple of years.",0
Easy class. Gives a lot of time to complete tests and readings. Took this class during the pandemic Fall 2020. Definitely recommend.,1
"Former Mayor Street is truly a character. The class is worth it just to hear the stuff he says. There is not much structure but it seems like if you complete the assignments you get an A. He also gets some really interesting high profile guest speakers to come in. I totally recommend the class, but just know that it's going to be a wild experience.",1
"His lectures are hard to comprehend. You must be willing to read the book and watch videos to understand the concepts. His HW are unnecessary, just copy them, but understand a few. His exams are doable, study the past and know the concepts. Easy Subject in General Communication. I think Electronics & Signal Processing are tough. Keep Studying!",0
She is by far one of the worst teachers I have ever had. Not helpful and doesnt seem to care that students have other classes than hers. I work part time and do school full time and I worked so hard in her class but she leaves her students out to dry. She seemed more interested in seeing her students repeat her classes than seing them be succesful.,0
"Great class to take especially for business and or law majors.  This professor has many years of law experience.  The textbook is not necessary though may be useful to take the exams.  No petty quizzes and or HW assignments.  Just show up ready to learn and take four tests throughout the semester.  If you show you should get an""A""!",1
"Not a bad guy, he's at times humorous and obviously passionate about what he does. That said, NOT the professor to take if you are not a math major. His accent and writing can make him hard to follow, particularly at the pace he goes through material. He had a hard time conveying the material to most of my class. Over 50% dropped, more failed...",0
She is not clear on the homework assignments and when you ask questions it just becomes less understandable Also shes crazy about attendance. She is a good lady just not a good teacher.4 major assignments and mid term and final are take home & take 8-20 hrs its no joke. would not recommend. grades very hard and doesn't put up grade till weeks later,0
"He is a terrible prof.  He may know the subject well but portraying it to students with very little mathematical background in the manor he did was horrible.  He has no control over the class, his accent is very thick, his exams are very hard which are multiple choice with no feedback.  The hw is online which makes it difficult to learn.",0
"You have to take this class twice, I took it the second time with Scoville. Expect to put more effort in this class but the payoff is better Arabic. My only complaint is the lack of clear grading criteria; although, that isn't really important in a language class.",1
I took this class online. Soooooo much work! I mean I get it it's college but we had 2 or more quizzes every week plus an assignment on top of that. Quizzes only worth 10 points of total grade. A lot of group work too. Would not take another class of hers,0
Her online course is one of the hardest to navigate which is ironic because of the class she teaches. If you ask about something on her course page that you couldn't find she'll make you go on a scavanger hunt through the clusterbomb of useless information on her page rather than taking 5 seconds to tell you. Also more homework than any class.,0
Great teacher! He is very clear and will explain everything completely. He is very patient and will go back to anything you didn't understand.,1
She is just the best. She really knows what she is talking about and she's there to help you. Very responsive to feedback and easy to talk to.,1
She is one of the greatest professors I ever had! She explains material clearly and very simulated. I love being in her class. Not a single day that I want to miss her class!,1
Very nice teacher. Have your book or just take notes.. Passed easily with an A..,1
"This prof may know her stuff, but she's better suited for a research position. Classes are incredibly long and boring, tests are semi-relevant and the majority of her examples are out-dated or don't appeal to the class.",0
"Best professor I have had at DePaul. I am an English student so I have been around the department and experienced much of the staff. Morano is extremely personable, interesting/interested in you, and makes an effort to get to know her students. I recommend her, as I will continue to take any course that she teaches!!",1
"Dr. Sullivan is a nice person, but just not a good prof. His expectations are too vague, he never responds to emails, and his lectures are incredibly boring. He only grades you by two exams and a four-page paper (and on a HUGE curve). The only reason I took this class is because it was required. I wouldn't take him again.",0
"The class is disorganized, assignments changed at the last minute.  Lectures aren't mandatory, but they are minimal at best.  Expect to write at least 6 papers, no tests.      If you expect an organized class that follows the syllabus this class isn't for you.  I would not recommend this class.",0
"This professor give you from 2-3 project for each of the 12 Chapters plus a Test with 30 to 50 Question. Every 3 Chapter he will add 1, 2 or 3 Project call Caps on Project from those three Chapter and after all that work you will also have a Final Exam with limited time and very long so he divided it in 3 Final Exams with 50 questions each.",0
"Literally every single lecture was a prerecorded video from another semester. I could have learned the same stuff from youtube, why did I pay Oakland thousands of dollars to watch videos. I have never witness a professor care less then Jonathan Maisonneuve. I'm struggling to find words to describe this sorry excuse of a professor. Just don't.",0
"Ms. Smith is so nice! Her lab practicals are difficult because she doesn't give you a word bank, and you have to memorize several complicated body parts, many of which sound Latin. But other than that, it's an easy course. Go to class, she gives you points every time you go!",1
Very little knowledge of economics.  VERY unclear about information in the course.  He has no clue what he is talking about.  His lectures and the class are extremely boring.  Tests are difficult to study for.  It always seemed that the information on the tests was not covered.,0
"Kim excels at teaching the subject matter in an efficient, yet introspective manner, making him pretty inspirational. He is also extremely understanding of other student's circumstances, especially considering 2020. Ask, and you shall receive. While quite serious most of the time, he's got rare moments of humor that nobody sees coming. real legend.",1
The class component in this course wasn't bad it was pretty straightforward math. The labs on the other hand were the complete opposite. The midterm was even worse he literally tested us on the smallest things from our labs and then to top it off gave the LONGEST integration question known to man as the final question!!!!,0
"This class is frustrating because the material itself isn't difficult to comprehend but the grading is murderous. Exams with short time limits make up the majority of your grade, but little mistakes cost you so many points. McLeod is not very forgiving, barely curves, and is occasionally rude.",0
He definitely cares and wants students to succeed. The problem was is he did not teach in a way that helped that. He mostly read off lecture slides and class was boring. Tests were difficult and he does not do nearly enough examples in class to make sure you understand material before class. Homework didn't really help you learn and was very hard.,0
"she is so useless, she only helps you if you're an AKA, which the whole student body isnt.",0
"The below is IMO. Pros: - Probably knows everything about physics and math - Fair grader/tester - Drills overlooked but necessary areas, like notation - Available Criticism: - Needs a larger whiteboard - Needs more theory in lectures You 110% must be self-motivated to succeed in Dr. Howell's class. His teaching style prioritizes reinforcement.",1
I loved this class and Im not even a History major. He is super nice and understanding and I thought his lectures were very interesting. Only Midterm and Final with four 1-2 page responses on books we read. (super easy) I would recommend this class to anyone who wants a fun class and very little homework.,1
"Great professor, couldn't ask for a better one.  Experienced and educated in subject matter that is taught. General interest in the opinion of students and willingly to discuss things in detail for his own and the class' benefit. Overall, 10/10.",1
"This class was a podium for him to spit his political views out. We actually got told that fantasy football is a construct to keep the white man in power over the black man. Don't be fooled by the name of the class, this has very little to do with sports themselves. The second half of this class is an attack on corporate America and how to ""resist""",0
he is the worst,0
"Nice woman, but discusses things of little relevance to the subject matter. Helps brainstorm paper topics, which is beyond valuable for the papers, but most of the discussion section consisted of awkward silences as responses to useless questions. Add feminist elements in your paper to up your grade.",0
Dr. Wike is such a nice lady and she makes the class extremely interesting. I took the class a year ago and still remember most of the readings because they leave an imprint on you!! She does a very good job preparing her class especially her reading selections and her witt and inteligence are clearly shown in her classes. Take her. I love her!!!!!,1
"If you go to him with a question, prepare to feel insulted, belittled, and still not have a clue whats going on.",0
"Provided online lectures during the pandemic, but they were extremely long and forced you to remember a lot. Only get one attempt for homework. Gives you a study guide, but pulls the ""not everything will be on the test"" card. Unrealistic student expectations and difficulty, especially for a low 300 level class.",0
Easy Class A+,1
"Great professor! He is super passionate about his class and loves when you go up to him to ask him a question. Loves our football team as well. If you can, TAKE HIM. Easy A, I'm telling you. We only ""read"" 2 books, write 4 easy papers, have a take home midterm, and the final is super easy. He made me like Texas history a little more.",1
"Took this class online. In the beginning of the semester, she made us do a discussion post every day for her class. I missed one, and my grade dropped from 98 to 87. The discussion posts are worth 10 points, but it weighs a lot because she doesn't give many assignments... at all. The semester ends next week and she hasn't graded anything else yet.",1
Professor Trubatch is a nice enough guy but his class is the hardest I have ever taken. My entire class is failing due to a horrible textbook and unclear lectures. Quizzes are nothing like what we do in class. It is defeating that a class full of math majors are failing a math class. I have never put so much in without any results.,0
"Easy professor, and interesting course. I recommend attending class often. She shows a lot of videos that are helpful for essays. There was only one in-class exam for the midterm. All other grades were essays of about 3 pages submitted online. The final  was even an essay. Fun professor, and very interesting material. Take course with her!",1
"This was probably the most unorganized class I've ever taken. You don't really have to go to class because the lectures, quizzes (7), and exams (3) are all online. As long as you complete the few assignments, quizzes, & exams you can easily get an A in this class. Don't rely on the syllabus b/c there are many typos and assignments left out.",0
The class was extremely difficult. Extra credit was given sometimes in class randomly. There were a couple group projects with your lab benches. I studied so much for her tests and read the textbook but still got around 60-70s on her test. There's a lot of grades though so it doesn't hurt your average extremely bad. You need to put in work.,0
Classes where great but marking scheme mad NO SENSE.I have teken high level Engl courses and only got a C+ in this. Seems to have unerlying homosexual themes in everything. Chosses Dark material (Gilgamesh/cosmopolis/hunters in winter)Great classes and a funny guy. VERY understanding and helpful with emails.,1
"She is a good teacher, but her grading methods can either make you or break you. She grades you on your participation in class she make sure you talk. Her book analysis' are pretty easy and she has several readings throughout the semester. Her test are hard if you don't take good notes.",1
"Prof. Olzman is an amazing professor. She is passionate about teaching and it shows. Also, go see her during office hours. She appreciates out -of-class participation. She's great one-on-one too. I got so much help on my speeches and helped with my grade.",1
"She is a lovely lady, but man does she grade hard. She took points off because I forgot to put the accent over the word résumé on my cover page. Other than her old style teaching ways, and can't get ahold of her by email she is alright.",0
"Dr Simerka is an AMAZING professor. This was my first honors class in Queens College. It definitely has a lot of reading involved, but she genuinely cares for her students. She pays attention to each students abilities and points them out often. She is very respectful and kind. I loved this class so much, if you try, she notices. BEST PROFESSOR!!",1
"Good prof! I enjoyed this class. Good test reviews before the test. I didn't have many problems with her. I also didn't find it to be very difficult. Is a bit disorganized, but it didn't impair my ability to learn.",1
"Mr. Harris is a great teacher. I have him for Women's Chorale and he is really encouraging and energetic. My only complaint is sometimes he doesn't tell us what we're doing wrong, he just keeps saying ""Do it again"" without saying what we need to fix.",1
"I had over 100 credit hours when I took her class and it was enough to make me consider dropping out. It was the worst college experience I've ever had. You'll pour days of your life into the project and be proud of the result. But regardless, she'll be offended by your efforts and tear every piece you turn in to shreds with no guidance provided.",0
"Prof. Weber is the definition of laziness. No lesson plan, he teaches out of the book. He makes up problems that backfire in the middle of lecture. (frustrating) He assigns most of odd problems, but class notes are not enough to encounter the difficult problems. You must teach your self and speed lots of hours in the math success center.",0
"Really enjoys the subject matter. Very difficult grader, and not very helpful for improving. Tends to keep all of her grade the same so it's really tough to improve once you're locked in to a certain grade.",0
I have very few good things to say to her besides the fact that she is nice. Her teaching is reading off a PowerPoint and her tests ask the most obscure and irrelevant questions that are not important Big picture questions. When half the class was struggling through with the pandemic she just said suck it up and would not offer much help.,0
"I honestly thought he was a bad teacher t first from all the previous rates, but I think hes a really good teacher and seems like he cares what hes teaching to the students. I know sometimes he might be confused about what hes doing but he always gets back on track.",1
This class was not what I expected. this teacher is all about journalism and he should stick with that only. MCOM 63 was about new media and all we did were videos. very disappointing class. He's helpful when one on one but very rude if its in front of the class. take a different teacher for MCOM 63,0
"Let me just say one thing... I have NEVER met a professor who is so into her classes as Professor Rasowsky is. She is absolutely an inspiration and she enjoys being there and teaching. She is so awesome, I recommend her to EVERYONE. Theres a lot of group work that she usually picks herself, but she's amazing. Best professor ever.",1
More work than all 3 of my other classes combined. Her class is literally a full-time job.,0
Wouldn't wish her on my WORST enemy.,0
He went off and got a new job at Google like 2/3 through the semester and dropped the ball on our class. Told us about a huge final project and then ended up assigning it like 3 days before it was due. It ended up being easier than anticipated but it was a stress fest. Was too busy to answer any questions via Slack so no one knew what was happening,0
"I have a sarcastic personality and strong opinions about millenials, therefore he and I got along great. He makes you think for yourself and participate during lectures (the horror). Tests are all essay questions, and you get them emailed to you ahead of time to study. Plenty of opportunity to do well, and he's passionate about teaching. Take him.",1
"Taking this class made me rethink my minor in Spanish. Not sure what it was about Professor Wilmore, but I was not engaged in class, felt little desire to attend, which is an issue for language learning. Instructions for certain assignments were unclear, and assignment schedule was weird. Calls exams projects which misled me about how to prepare.",0
"There is so much reading. The worst part is for the test, she gave us 54 terms for us to define and only 10/12 will be on the actual test and out of those 10/12, we only have to do 5/6. Lectures are alright but they do not redeem for how much reading there is or how she handles the test study guide.",0
"He is seriously the best proff at UM-Dearborn.  The man is like 70 something, rides his bike to work, and walks in the field for 8 hours/day.  He obviously loves the environment, teaching, and his students.  He is not kidding about the amount of time spent on the notebook but if you do it everyday, you will pass.  Very smart  but not condescending.",1
Dr. Montes-Jordan was the most difficult professor to understand. He has a very thick Latin accent of some kind. There is a ton of material covered and you have to know it well to ace a test. Thankfully theres EC for tests. His lectures are long and painful. Perhaps he's a great teacher for aspiring med students but not for A.A degree students.,0
She was extremely rude and was constantly calling out students. She was also very unclear with assignments and got pissy when people messed up. She would walk around the class and stand over people's shoulders all the time as well. I did well in this class but she made me uncomfortable.,0
"Worst professor I've ever had; doesn't know how to teach; you will learn nothing from him. Just stands in front of the class and mumbles incrompehensibly. The class is so useless; less than 20 usually show up out of 140. He is also very mean and not willing to help students either. If you have to take this class, please find a different professor.",0
"Professor Mantell got very sidetracked. By the third week, our class was behind 2 lectures. She is very sweet, but she gives too much information that is not needed for the course. My fiancee is a bio major and helped me throughout the course and she even said she was not a good professor. The ""mean"" for our exam grades averaged out around a D.",0
"Dr. K was fantastic, I very much enjoyed his class. He was very flexible and fair. I would recommend him to anyone! Great at explaining things so students at different skill sets could understand.",1
She doesn't give feedback or let you see what you got wrong on quizzes. This is especially a problem because she has made mistakes grading. She gets annoyed when students ask questions. I basically taught myself using the online homework and book.,0
"Great professor, I learned a lot from real world business person. I liked the way he related the material to current situations in business.",1
"Interesting topic, but he makes it boring and even more confusing. Gives no feedback. Assignments are crammed and confusing. Does not help. Assignments will take forever, but only worth a few points. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Steffens related world issues to whatever we were learning in econ that week. I found it to be really interesting and she did a really good job explaining everything. She also offers a ton of extra credit. My econ grade wasn't too hot at first, but because of her journ. portion of the class, i just raised my grade tremendously",1
"Not a bad guy, he just doesn't know how to teach. Seems as though he doesn't even care, he's gone over some of his powerpoints twice and hasn't even noticed. Very difficult to sit through his class and pay attention. Goes on a tangent every 5 minutes. Avoid this prof. if you can.",0
Gives out a lot of work. Super heavy lectures. Monotoned. Class feels super long. Doesn't take time to know students. Very dull teacher. No motivation.,0
"Great professor, very kind and understanding. I enjoyed his lectures and that some weeks there was class and some days it was just recorded (to give a break from zoom). Only complaint, wish he would send out if zooms were happening early in week. Would send out past 11pm for an 8am class. Overall, great class and professor though.",1
"In-class assignments every day, so your grade will drop fast if you miss. Extremely tough grader (I rarely got full credit for assignments and I'm an A student). She wants things done a specific way and if you don't ask questions or confirm how something should be done, you will lose points. There are easier teachers for this class.",0
He just lectures the entire class which gets very boring. The quizzes are super easy but the tests are very difficult. Geography was my best subject in high school. I took this class my first semester and got the lowest grade in this class. Expect to study a lot more than you think you will need to.,1
"Truly one of the best professors I've had. He does give a lot of homework and it's a hard class, but he genuinely tries to make it as easy as possible for students while making sure we are still learning. The exams are just like the HW. He interacts with the class during lecture a lot so its engaging, he's funny, and very approachable. Great prof",1
"Lectures are pretty boring, but the material is interesting. The tests are taken directly from the quiz and clicker questions. If you do bad on a test, she will make it a point to meet with you and help. Very easy honors credit.",1
"Honestlyonly take this class if you already have some photography/adobe premiere experience. His assignments forced me to get out of my comfort zone, which I appreciated. Having your work ripped apart in front of your peers helps to develop tough skinif you can't handle critique from Cheers, you're not cut out for Journalism, honey!! Get out now!",0
Reads off slides and does not help students at all with questions. I learned more about accounting with help in high school then this class...,0
Fail me although he knows my difficult situation,0
"If you want to pass, avoid at all costs. Plays favorites big time, and will not help students he does not like for whatever reason.",0
"Dr. Hines's lectures are very confusing, since he often gets the questions wrong. I have attended every class and done all the homework and still do not understand the material because of his lectures. His office hours are during my other classes, so I recommend going to the Study or Mathskellar because his lectures/notes online are not helpful.",0
Cool,1
"very monotone. lots of homework. do good on final and all test grades are replaced. online quizzes are easy, homework is difficult. curves all tests including final. attendance isn't part of grade but essential to succeed. take him! he wants you to pass the class",1
Arevalo is a very temperamental individual. She doesn't like to be challenged and doesn't explain anything well. She runs through slides like its sometype of game and doesnt explain anything. She crams in material before exams and excepts you to guess whats on her mind. She is not considerate and not very present. and loves to single people out!,0
She gives an unnecessary amount of homework and takes forever to grade it. I always dreaded going to her class but she did cancel quite often.,0
"It's clear that KMack is very knowledgable about ECON, but his ability to transfer that knowledge to students is nonexistant. Syllabus is outdated, and tbh useless bc he doesnt follow it. No one understood how much each exam was worth. No explanation was ever given. No grades were distributed. Went into the final not knowing where I stood.",0
"I really hope she reads these and sees the feedback. This class was horrible. Way too many readings, responses, quizzes, and some nice 50 question exams. Most professors choose either a long multiple choice or a full essay, but she does both. WAY too much work total for 100 level class.",0
"Gives you leeway if you accidentally mess up a paper, pretty good professor.",1
"Dr Wisner is very clear about his expectations, and explains them in detail. Following his rubrics and examples has definitely made me a better writer. He's a little slow when it comes to grading, but if you follow the directions, you should have no problem getting an A.",1
She's a very nice teacher just do your work and make sure all assignments are on time she doesn't like late work. If you do whats expected which isn't much you will for sure to get an easy A. This class has helped me especially since i'm not big on speaking in front of people but she made it simple and easy.,1
LONG LIVE MARTHA RANCOURT!!!!!,0
The class is pretty easy and there is no excuse anyone should fail the tests. There are quite a few writing assignments but they aren't too difficult and they are spaced out nicely. She can grade pretty hard on written works but high test grades help. Ms. Nelson loves participation and expects questions asked and answered.,1
I love RIT,0
"She doesnt respond to any emails, takes forever to grade, and doesnt consider that were in a PANDEMIC. Her grading was tough and she wasnt lenient at all. Take it at another school dont put yourself through the stress and mental deterioration. Disappointed because I had heard so many good things about her when classes were in person.",0
"Listen for nonart majors, this class will kill your GPA if you think oh that's an easy A. He's rude and tough grader. I took an upper-level painting class and got an A, this is a 1000 level class and he gave me a C?? this class makes no sense like is this even art ?He's too demanding someone needs to put him in his place cause it's 1000 level class",0
"Avoid him with all costs. He is talented in making easy and simple things into very complicated lectures. He might have been great as an airport manager, but he is not so good at teaching. His lectures can be more organized and sequential. You'll have to go back and forth on your notes adding information to previous notes.",0
"Despite getting the highest grade on all of the exams (90 avg), I still almost made a C in the class because of pop quizzes. Asks extremely specific questions and sometimes counts AGAINST you for getting it wrong. Burghardt is laughably condescending. You'd think you're talking to a celebrity with how self-important he is. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS",0
Professor Stevenson is by far the best professor I've ever had. Her class is tough but thats because Anatomy is a tough subject. She takes time out of her day and outside of class to teach you and make sure yo understand everything. She is extremely helpful and such a nice person. Would 100% take again. Amazing!!,1
Jeri is an absolutely amazing teacher. I'm looking forward to  taking another class with her in the future. She grades all work very fairly and is willing to help you with just about anything. You have a lot of freedom when doing all of the projects! This was my favorite class of the semester!,1
I'm class of 2020. I would not have been accepted to Public Hlth MS program at UW without taking this course and without his advice. Taking this course changed my outlook for my future. I am indebted to this professor.,1
"Great professor. Your grade is based on only 4 exams, but if you read the textbook and take notes you will have no problem at all. If you don't, this class is not for you. Professor gives tons of free answers and extra credit during the lectures. As long as you put the work into it, you will easily get an A.",1
"The first couple weeks of lecture are tough to get used to for sure. She has an interesting accent, goes through her lecture slides extremely quickly, and the reading can pile up. But once you get used to her style of lecture, it is not too bad. Just make sure you keep up with the readings, pay attention in lecture and don't worry about copying eve",1
"If you take her NGO class, take it seriously, and it will be one of the few courses at NYU you will cherish.",1
No Comments,0
"Dr. Grange is very intelligent and is a well respected financial planner.  He wants his students to succeed which is why his course is so difficult.  Listen closely, because he has really dry humor.  Make sure to read the book and go to office hours.",1
Students who are wanting to learn how to write papers properly this is the class to take. Fox lets students knows what is expected from her students on the first day of class and she hold students to it. Fox is tough because she cares. by mid semester she relaxes just a little bit . I am taking her next semester for English 102. ,1
"Prof. Partovi was a great professor. Participation doesn't matter, BUT attend his office hours so that he can get to know you. He knows so much about Iran and about history in general. He is witty and funny at times. The final paper was long, but going to office hours will help you!",1
"Her class wasn't that bad if you are not a CS major.  You won't retain anything that's covered in the class.  The class is one of those ""write it down, memorize it, and put it back down on a test.""  Since I wasn't a CS major, I could care less.  It was one of the few A's that I've gotten.",1
The lab book is required so buy don't rent it. The first half of the semester was kinda difficult bc you are kinda on your own to teach yourself. The second half of the semester is better. There is a lab practical and Final. She doesn't give reviews (just to read) but she's really nice and willing to help. I would take her again for a course.,1
"Don't listen to the people saying that you CANNOT understand him, yes he has an accent but you get over it after the first class. 20% of the class is online homework and if you utilize his office hours you should get 100's. Three exams and a final, with your best exam being 30%, second best 20%, worst 10%. Very helpful outside of class!!",1
"If you're looking for a passive history class to coast through this GUR, DO NOT TAKE GILL. She's under the dire misimpression that her students want to take the class seriously - THEY DO NOT.   Obscure questions, tons of homework reading for EVERY class, low quality preparation material before exams, often late to class. 2/10 would not take again",0
"She explains with longs powerpoints, a totally confusion. She only says the date of the exams in class no emails. She in kind but doesn't help too much. Drops the lowest grade.",0
This professor frustrates me. Even with extra credit work it wont make up for all of the daily assignments that have been put in... the daily quizzes can be hard and confusing. Do not recommend this teacher.,0
"Overall: Very poor lecture, requires time to teach yourself. Lecture: Verbally teaches math, lacks organization, a lot of side talk. Homework: will assign problems that he didnt lecture on (uses textbook). Tests: Mostly basic problems, do the study guide. He is nice, kind, and funny. If you already know math and dont need any help, take him.",0
you will need to study like crazy- do ALL the practice problems. if you do this all then you'll do really well. and she's really good. but dont think that you can slack- you really need to work to do well.,1
Syllabus is very clear on what is due and when. He lists what he is grading you on in each assignment. Happy to answer any questions you have. Organized and straight forward. This class was very basic and easy to pass. Just show up and do the homework on time.,1
"He tries to be innovative in his teaching style, but it's a bad method. He thinks he's the smartest man on Earth and claims to care for his students, but I tried to reach out to him and he never emailed me back. Picks a few favorites and gives them the highest grades and attention most of the time. Unreasonable grading, idk if anyone will get an A.",0
would not take a class of hers again,0
Avoid. You will lose interest in the course on the first day. Cannot present information effectively and always gives off the impression that he does not have a clue about what he is talking about. Does not belong teaching an upper level course. Attendance is mandatory with a sign in sheet. Tests are fill in the blank with word banks. Avoid.,0
The professor is good at in explaining concepts but what was taught turned out to be not so helpful for graduate students.,0
He is respectful towards all his students. I honestly thought I wasnt going to pass his class because politics has always been so hard for me but he doesnt expect so much on students. He gives very easy 1-2 page readers response essays and gives 3 exams including finals. Hes a great professor. I do recommend him. Hes shy but very kind and helps,1
worst teacher ever period !,0
"Not sure what these students are talking about. The bad reviews are clearly from the people who don't want to work for their grade. This is nursing, what do you expect? If you can't handle the lectures, then you're not smart enough to be a nurse. She cares about her students and people are getting mad about the HESSI, it's her job, not her doing.",1
"If you are looking for a professor that will inspire you and make you believe in yourself, do not take her course. Dr. Wilson does not present confidence in the material, is a moving target for assignments, and treats her students as delinquent HS freshmen. Spends too much time on powerpoint slides, you're better off reading at home. Bored nightly.",0
"THIS CLASS IS NOT AN EASY A. He makes terrible jokes and the class is not interactive. He never explains a specific topic but gives out long random examples that are not really helpful or explanatory. Operations Mgmt is an interesting subject, said everyone but I hate it because of him. You'll need a textbook that he wrote and is available for $90 ",0
Professor Kaur is a very nice professor. She is very caring of her students and very passionate about her teachings. She does give out lots of pages to read from the textbook. You're mostly speaking and doing powerpoint presentations in each class. Overall the class was okay.,1
"Seriously, to echo everybody else, never ever ever take. The cutoff for a B+ was an 87.  I got an 88 and he gave me a B because he told me he didn't think I deserved a B+.",0
"Assignments were marked unfairly, the midterms and finals are extremely hard. The prof is overall a nice guy but the class is definitely not something anyone at york should ever take.",0
Awesome class he is very knowledgeable on the subject and willing to go out of his way to help.,1
"Dr. O'Hanlon is very caring and helpful. She doesn't tolerate any bull though and she sniffs it out instantly. This course is a heavy workload, but great for HR and business majors. You definitely want to get to know O'Hanlon and have her get to know you. She's very empathetic as it is, but it makes her less intimidating. Doesn't answer email.",1
"Nice but seems unorganized and unprepared. Essay assignments make no sense. Unnecessarily repetitive. The class was online for me, so it could be different in person.",0
"He has a fun, sarcastic, corny sense of humor. He's a great teacher, and will answer any questions, even if he's already answered it a million times. His tests are easy if you just go over the slides, read the chapters, and practice a couple problems. Projects are ok if the people in your group aren't idiots.",1
"Despite the heavy lecture material, Goldberg was able to keep me engaged during lecture with his quirky and upbeat personality. All of his lecture slides are posted on Moodle which is helpful if you happen to miss lecture. He allows students to record his entire lecture on their cell phone for future reference.",1
"Alright. She is such a difficult teacher. You have to work for your grade, which isn't the issue. The issue is your work is probably not sufficient enough. Show up, try hard, and be nice.",0
I have never experienced such a rude and unhelpful professor here at Miami. I was very disappointed with the way she handled situations via email and during discussions. The class is easy but is also easily one of the most boring classes I have ever taken. I loved anthropology before her class. I seriously suggest against taking any class with her.,0
I adore this woman. She cared so much for all her students - would reexplain as much as needed (she would bake for us too). Only class I would actually take at 8am. Good amount of homework in the textbook but we would go over it every class. Test/quiz questions taken straight from the homework exercises. Gives 1/2 and 1/4 credit on tests/quizzes.,1
"I lost all respect for him towards the end of the semester when he kept showing us pictures of the effects of war. They were tasteless and vulgar and lowered his professionalism as a teacher. Also, he made a paper due a couple days after our final which is not ethical. I spoke to other professors & they all encouraged me to talk to the dean.",0
"Dr. Lyons is a really nice prof, and I think she wants students to do well, but doesn't adapt to different learning types. Her tests are way too hard.",0
"I pay the University to learn physics but in return i end up teaching myself. The only time u will be taught by him is if youre lucky enough to be inhis group (which he changes every 3 weeks ) , his TA sucks and confuses everyone and no one gives you a straight up answer . its frustrating to be in a class where its all a guessing game.",0
Tough grader!,1
He made me face a lot of my fears with swimming and he was always very nice and ready to give good feedback. The way he grades is harsh and you have a skills test at the end and I do not believe that's fair.,1
Not at all understanding of missing class. It is a pandemic and life happens but to him nothing should be more important than his class. Often did not explain assignments clearly. Ignored students email. If you were oh so lucky to get an email then all he'll tell you is to look at the syllabus.,0
Angie is the best prof at X! She is so passionate about her work that you can't help but enjoy learning it. She uses her own textbook so it's really easy to understand. When you are reading it you can basically hear her voice in your head. You do still need to work hard to get a good grade though but she is always there if you need help! Love her!!,1
"At first I hated this class with every fibre of my being. But honestly, once you begin to speak up more and understand her teaching method, she's one of the best professors you can have. She is more than willing to help with anything she can, and gives extensive and useful feedback. Always answers emails quickly. Does everything she can.",1
She is a very tough grader and her requirements are ambiguous; you are never really sure what she is looking for. The class overall is boring and way too much work for a 2 credit hour course. Her interactions with students is unpleasant and can be downright rude! I will be sure to never take a class with her again!,0
"Dustin is a great teacher and very willing to help outside of class if you need him to. He lines out on day one what is expected of you and by when, his deadlines are actual deadlines so don't miss them. I have taken multiple classes from him. I think he's the best (NOT EASIEST) professor at WSU. I've learned more from him than any other professor.",1
"Absolutely great prof!!  No one else could have given such a good introduction to CS.  His lectures were the most interesting from all my first year profs. Also, he made  the course material pretty challenging and way more fun than the regular CS courses. His lecture notes are complete and very helpful. Best class I took in my first year.",1
"Read word-for-word from Powerpoint so didn't really teach the material. Tests were extremely difficult in comparison to her level of teaching and included trickily worded questions. Was very vague when it came to project instructions and would then grade very strictly, claiming aspects where missing that she didn't ask for.",0
"Doesnt use cuLearn to release grades & requires students to hand in hard copies of all assignments which wastes time & is outdated. There is only 1 knowledgeable TA & the others are basically useless. The prof doesnt answer emails professionally, nor is he helpful in office hours or explaining concepts during lecture.",0
"Avoid this class. Prof. Bauner is from Germany and it is very difficult to understand him, and his presentations were boring. The only reason I went to class was for iClicker. Homework was difficult, and the multiple choice tests were not representative of what was taught in lecture. He is also not interested in helping students learn or understand",0
"If you struggle with math, try to avoid if possible. He is a very smart man, but skips a lot of mathematical steps  that you normally need to piece it all together.  You need to take the initiative and learn outside of class with his notes, textbook and tutors.  Tests are hard but fair. ",0
"Don't really like the way he teaches -- in fact I don't think I would call it teaching.  He's not clear and he doesn't teach you the stuff he tests you on; he expects you to learn it by reading it on the web.  If I wanted to do distance learning, I wouldn't be going to class every week.",0
"Chemistry is naturally a hard class but Kiesewetter knows what she's doing. Her lectures are very organized, clear, and helpful and her teachings are coherent and understandable. The homework are very helpful for exams. There are four exams and a final but if you honestly dedicate your time to this with her teachings you will come out successful.",1
"Such a handsome, hot guy. Makes me go crazy everytime  I see him. Wow makes my heart melt. Easy grader, wonderful dude and just an awesome professor. I recommend him. Makes my moo moo go wild.",1
This man loves his job.,1
She would be a great 4th grade teacher with all of her petty nitpicky rules.Chastising grown adults is totally inappropriate for a 400 level college class.She gets really madd when people arrive late and are on laptops.She does not post her powerpoint lectures so you should be there for every class.She is knowledgable about the subject matter.,0
Dr. Currier was an excellent teacher! I would really recommend her for this class. She wants you to succeed and she makes the class more interesting and manageable.,1
"You have to write, take, and then grade your own tests, FOR A GRADE(This will take you hours). Not to mention the numerous progress reports you have to send her just to tell her you completed another assignment. Do not take this class if it is given online. It will be the most stressful thing, especially when you have to write your own final",0
"He's kind of funny, but most people just seem annoyed with his humor. He calls us ""people"" all the time, and makes weird noises when he speaks. Some days I would get lost in counting the time he said ""people, if you dont' know this by now, then..."" and I would completely miss out on the material. Really knows his stuff though",0
His tests are ridiculously hard relative to the rest of the class.  No homework except  3 group projects and 4 quizzes.  LOTS of memorization for the tests.  English is reallllly hard to understand.  He intentionally makes the project descriptions arbitrary and  confusing.,0
She's fantastic. BI202 is framed in a way for non-biology majors and it's done impeccably. Lectures are very engaging and I also like how exams are graded on a curve. Definitely recommended.,1
"She believe that her method of teaching is the best she even stated she would make allot of money if she sold her material and ways of teaching, but for me!! Her way of teaching did  not work she gave so many notes!! And it bothered me that she would hand write her test they were all stumbled up no have to bring extra paper to solve the problems",0
Tammi is more than a great teacher. She cares about each and every one of her student and will go beyond to help them succeed. I am a shy person in class but she made it comfortable for every student. Really enjoy having her as a teacher and advisor. Definitely recommended her,1
"Take his class and you will wish you dead several times throughout the semester. His lectures are boring, his voice is monotone, his tests are stupid hard for no reason, the power points are not even close to what is on the test. I had him for a summer semester online and he shows the class averages on Canvas. Most of the class did not pass. warned",0
"Pass on this Professor. Doesn't teach, is rude at times and expects the most from students. Heavily graded on discussion boards and participation.",0
Well so far the notes don't really match up with the test. Its as if he wants you to master all the info for every test. The book does not seem to help. The average for exam 1 was just above 70...most ppl I talked to made in the 50's... vary hard class lets hope it ends well...only take if you really really need to.,0
"Boring, difficult to listen to lectures. You have to write exactly what he wants for papers, or you miss massive points. Avoid if possible.",0
"He was a very nice person. He lectures a lot, some are difficult to follow. He provides study guides for all his tests. As long as your study them, you will make an easy A. 4 tests, 3 papers to write. The papers were not hard, just time consuming.",1
"Very bad. The class is supposed to be aboud culture, but she ends up teaching mostly history. Is unclear, lectures have little to do with exam material. Without discussion sections, the exams would be utterly impossible. Accent sometimes hard to understand (she's Polish) and rambles in lectures on nonrelated material.",0
"I recommend anyone but him, he does not take the time to actually teach students. Very inactive when it comes to labs, by walking around class and expecting students to self-learn. The exams were really hard and he does offer extra credit but what does 1 point really do when he rarely likes a students response to the bonus question.",0
"Worst finance Professor at Salisbury. Class isnt too boring but you will not learn anything. Each test, more than 90% of the class did not finish on time. He says lazy things like how him grading your work makes him deserve teacher of the year. Do Not Take him.",0
He doesn't do much lectures and he gives short examples but most of the time he missed an example that we see in homework that we were not taught yet. It's very confusing but if you study hard and you'll pass the class & tests just fine. He does one day in computer lab to assist you on your homeworks and does other day in a classroom for lectures.,0
"i took three classes by her and i loved it, she's very nice and the class was easy, i never read the book and got an A in all three of the classes. BUT class is mandatory!",1
The journalism section of Econ 1051 is a COMPLETE waste of time.  She expects people to participate in a giant lecture and she talks about subjects we haven't covered yet.,0
Dr. Lee is a pretty good professor. The class itself is not easy. I felt like I learned a lot in this class.,1
I took this class over the summer for my major (SLHS) and it was the best decision I've ever made. Professor Raney was hands down the best professor I've ever had in college. Her lectures are very clear and her quizzes and exams (midterm/final) are VERY straightforward. If you complete her practice worksheets you will be golden. TAKE THIS PROFESSOR,1
"Wouldn't recommend taking this professor. If you do, use your own note taking system...his is very unclear and repetitive.  Also, he is very condescending...he treats you like junior high students. I've never written a review for a professor before, but this guy made me feel like I had to.  I enjoy history, but I do NOT enjoy his class.",0
"First art class taken at Oneonta and she was great. Open to all ideas, I've never heard her tell anyone their ideas/projects were bad. Even if you're not good at art she helps improve your basic skills. Class focused a lot on compositions and basic art elements. Some work outside of class if you didn't finish a project but no real hw.",1
"Great teacher! love this class! new teacher,but doing well! If you come to class and do your work, you will get an A for sure! he has a routine and sticks to it, I recommend this class, especially if you are curious about religion,you will learn a lot! he is very knowledgeable of  material and can elaborate on what the book teaches!HE GETS an ""A""",1
"Sociology was a really easy class. There is a discussion and a quiz every week to do, and thats pretty much it. The final is open note and easy. Professor Robertson is really laid back. Shes an easy grader. I enjoyed this class a lot because she also had great feedback and commentary as well! This class is really interesting and a must for all.",1
If you want to learn take Professor Conroy. He gives amazing lectures and if you do not understand something he will explain it again until you understand it. He cares about every single student in his class. Everyone matters!!!! He gives reviews before each test which is very helpful. I learned a lot in his class.,1
"Interesting man, probably shouldn't be a teacher though. Does not believe that grades are important to his students. Class notes are random and unorganized. Tests are nearly impossible because he gives no insight as to what will be on them. Projects are useless, time consuming and have nothing to do what is discussed in class. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS",0
"2 tests, many quizzes, 1 paper, no final. Terry is extremely scattered in his lectures but he's a nice, funny guy. If you're good at memorizing experiments and their significance to psychology and learning material independently outside of class, this is the class for you. It's hard to sit through lectures most days unless you participate",0
Dr. Houston is a fair teacher. If you don't read and study the class could be hard. Her test aren't easy. They require a lot of reading and studying. She's not as bad as these posts make her out to be. She is a very friendly professor outside the classroom but she is strictly about business when in the class. Just be prepared to work extra hard!,0
"He is extremely lecture heavy. However, hes just reading from slides that arent even his! When he goes off script, he just confuses the class. He knows what the topic is but hes not good at articulating anything. It feels like hes still stuck in 1972. Theres no curve too and he LOVES saying it too. Avoid him. Hes not mean just a bad professor",0
Great Class. Chance to write. Nice workshops. Meets w/ u to help.  write one complete short story in the semester.  See others work.  Everyone comments on each other's work so be able to take comments.,1
"Dr. Kim has a great personality with an accent to match. Neither of these assist in understanding the materials. Though the tests often covered more chapters than manageable (because she runs out of time), she is fair in grading. I earned a mid-C, but she graciously rounded me to a B due to constant attendance. She recognizes students who try!",0
"Dr. Borglin is a really nice and understanding  professor. However, she sometimes can't explain a concept easily and may jump around, but she is always willing to help and will make sure you do understand on way or another. Overall, if you do your work and ask questions, you can easily get a B.",1
"I have never had a teacher that grades so ridiculously, she has no clear rubric for how she grades at all. I wholeheartedly believe when grading she takes into account if she likes your or not (your attendance/attention in class). She try to make it near impossible to make a high A, only allowing a 95 as highest grade on discussion boards.",0
"Really knowledgeable in his field, caring professor. Easy, and not much work to do, only 1 case study, 2 papers and the exams. The case study is done in a group. I got a 90 in his class. Extremely easy grader on the 2 papers that are take home finals. Do not listen to the bad comments, take him if you want a good grade. Easy to get extra credit",1
Best prof! Very caring and interactive. Really wants you to do well. You must go to class but it is worth it.,1
Save yourself the struggle and take Ryba. She uses his material anyways except Ryba is much clearer and actually knows how to explain the topics well. Take her only if for some reason you have to retake the course and you know half of the material already.,0
"she talks too fast and speeds through her slides. I often answered her questions in class and went to her office and i still failed. She doesnt care about what you have going on outside of her class, and she doesnt like to help you. She allows 15 minutes per student in her office, and isnt even there half of the time. Avoid this professor!!!!",0
"She is a very nice professor and helps you with what you need, but this class is basic memorization. If you review the terms everyday, then you should be fine. She gives a lot of partial credit.",1
"Professor Looney has great knowledge in Astronomy, while he can explain them in a super easy way in an elementary class. He taught this class with great passion and great illustration. This class is definitely fun to take. If you are interested in further knowledge that this class won't cover, don't hesitate to ask him. Great teacher.",1
Worthless.,0
"I wish that Prof. Liu taught Calc 2. I took calculus in high school and mostly already understood the course, but she made the concepts so much clearer than I remember learning them. Her accent isn't that hard to understand and she will do everything to make sure you pass the class. Homework is completion, tests are short and the class isn't long.",1
"He is not a bad teacher but, he goes quickly and will sometimes poke at you in front of the class for asking questions frequently. To do well in the class be sure to read the book before lectures and take notes. You can google how to do the homework for help. My class had 10/11 tests because chem dept. was trying a new thing, not too bad.",1
"Hands down worst prof i've ever had, not sure how he has not been fired. Grades by his judgement, not what questions you answered correctly. Tests you on things he didn't even talk about, and are 10 pages in length. Best of Luck!!",0
"She is off topic during lecture and gives lots of trick questions on her exams. Her reviews are not helpful, so it is really hard to study the right things for her exams. I recommend going to class, even though it is not mandatory, because she gives clicker point extra credit.",0
"Dr. Schellhorn is a very nice woman and clearly knows what she is talking about, however she think everyone should just automatically getitand if you don't she essentially tells you that you shouldn't be in her class.  Also, grade depends on just 3 exams with unfair grading scale - if u get just 5 wrong youre already at a 60% and she does not curve",0
"BE PREPARED TO READ A LOT! I understand this is college and there will be a lot of reading, but the amount of reading he assigns is crazy! He had us read about 6 articles 20+ each for an essay, and at the same time he wanted us to read 4 other articles 30+ pages each for our discussions. I've done more work in this class any class I've taken. ",0
I'm taking her Fall online class & I am loving it! she is very nice and helpful. I would retake her!,1
"Classwork is a breeze. Speeches are also very easy (2 individual, 2 group). Lectures are pointless- I didn't learn anything from them. Prof Peterson is incredibly enthusiastic and kind.",1
Awesome and very Professional! I am able to use everything he taught me.  He keeps it real and exciting! I would love to work with him the field.,1
"I've always learned better when things are explained to me, she doesn't give you any specific reading as to what will be needed for quizzes or tests, you literally have to read the entire chapter, which means you'll eventually end up reading the entire textbook. no reviews are given, no study guides and some of the tests were very difficult.",1
Dr. Wigginton is not a good professor and will ruin your whole semester. She has never responded to any of my emails and during class says she doesnt work Friday - Monday so we need to ask all questions in class vs. email. I went to her office hours twice and she wasnt there. Class content is easy but I hate the way she talks down to us.,0
He does not teach. His notes don't explain anything and are written in the format of a horrible textbook. His exams are very hard and require derivations that no one in the class can complete.... which would be fine if they were anything we actually learned. Unorganized and one of the worst professors I've had in CHE,0
"I had Dana at DePaul and everyone in this class talked about how much they loved her. Great personality, really wants students to engage in material and she made learning a new language so easy (very minimal hw and outside). Class is spent practicing so all you have to do are some short workbook pages. Highly highly recommend",1
"I've taken 2 classes with Brian McKenna-Rice, and I'll be taking another one with him next semester. He genuinely wants his students to succeed and makes himself available to assist them, as needed. Brian is very knowledgeable in his field and has a lot to offer his students. His method of instruction is very laid back and interactive. 2 thumbs up!",1
"Very interesting class to fulfill elective requirements. Textbook is used and must be read to get full participation points and for the exams. 2 quizzes, 2 exams, and a final. Lectures are worth attending and cover topics for the exams/quizzes. A good amount of reading outside of class, but not unmanageable. Professor is wonderful and helpful",1
"She's a good teacher. However, sometimes she will tell you to change something on your paper and then take off points when grading because that part didn't fit. Also, not very clear grading criteria.",0
Professor Hayes is a excellent instructor because I was able to take the knowledge I acquired in class and  integrate it into my day to day life.,1
"Orgo is hard first of all, but he makes it fairly easy. Just pay attention in class and do hw problems He is grade If you hate him, i assume u didnt even try and complaining I took him orgo 1 and 2 i struggled in orgo 1, but i read book, solved problems in orgo 2 I am doing good try, if you try, you will do okay",1
Jeff is a really hot teacher. Hes always five minutes late atleast but its ok because his looks make up for that. He is somewhat interest in what hes talking about but gets off topic fast. He assigned little/no tests so its hard to stay on track.,1
No Comments,1
"I know learning new language is hard enough,but she expects you to know everything.I mean everything! She lies too!Said she won't put some of the stuff on the exam. She repeated her herself atleast 5 times! But oh no,she had to put it.Everyone in my class had to say something about her.Thats how bad she is.",0
she does about a month's worth of lectures and then puts the rest on students. I pay her salary and she sits back and watches. 15 minute presentations from students for 3 hours numbs your mind; we are not professors so it can get quite boring. AVOID HER CLASS AT ALL COST,0
If you want someone who is never on time to class and never grades assignments then this is your teacher! I took her for comp 2 in the spring of 2016 and the only grade she entered was our final. I still have no clue what I made on any of her essays because she never posted them or have them back!,0
"This class was one of the easiest classes I have ever taken in my entire life, but the material was ridiculous. Professor is much more likely to give you an A if you agree with his stance on issues, even if your work is of much lower quality than those who disagree. Take him for the easiest A of your life, but don't expect to learn much.",0
"I honestly do not even know where to start. - Her teaching is all over the place. - She is very confused when she is teaching and therefore her exams are also confusing - Does not like when people go to the bathroom or are 1 minute late to class, even though she is late most of the time - I am an A student but got a very low grade with her.",0
"Stuffy, puffy and full of himself. A joke, really.",0
I loved jamie and her classes. While she can be a little intimidating at first if you just pay attention and participate in class its really fun. She very knowledgeable about dog training and behavior and i've learned a lot from taking both courses. She is also very helpful outside of class and a great resource. Its not a fluff course but not hard.,1
"Pretty awesome teacher easy going,laid back,funny at times open book tests (only 2)1 short paper 1 group presentation , i recommand him",1
"You can't hear him most of the time with his german accent and he may look mean, but he grades easy on the lab reports, gives you full points for non-lab report labs, and always wants to end the class early.  You never stay the full 3 hrs and he is nice!",1
"Has no clear guidelines but expects so much. He gets mad when the class does bad but when you ask him what to study, he'll call it ""fishing for answers."" ""Fishing"" makes him even madder and he says if we ""fish"" the test will get harder. He asks questions on content he hasn't taught and expects you to know it.",0
On line class stinks - if you need help you need to go to the center.  Timed quizes and exams.  I always felt so stressed.  Not instructor's fault.  If you are sick that is to bad - you still have to take the quiz and test on line by a certian date and time.  Math would be better in the classroom!,0
"The professor doesn't respond in a timely manner. She doesn't check the answers on her exams, there were 5 wrong answers on our midterm (unable to determine if there were any wrong answers on the final). She is laid back in class but a tough grader. You must read the book and come to class if you want to pass. Shows up late often",0
"I've been out of the program of years, but have found many useful gems from Arnold's class",1
Best in the college. Not a hard class. Pay attention to class.,1
Midterm is the biggest pain ever.  Don't take this class.,0
"don't take this professor! on the last day of class, he said we 'can't ask any stupid questions', my friend asks him to repeat a question and says ""class is dismissed, get out"". He assumes we ONLY take his class with no other work for other classes, is the rudest prof, and will call you out in front of the class if you have your phone visible.",0
"Professor Maria will not put up with disrespect. Homework is tough without a tutor to help. She informs her Students' what will be expected on her Exams. She is a tough grader when it comes to her memos for her individual Project. If you keep in contact with her she will help you pass as long as you keep up with Homework and, her Tutoring Session!",1
She is very unorganized. Doesn't give clear instructions on what she expects to be turned in.  You must teach yourself. Exams are almost never similar to the study guides. At first seems nice but it all changes. Class goes from being full to only 17 people by the end. If I knew she was this bad I would of never taken her class. ,0
"She's amazing! This was my first class at Duke, and she was such a good teacher! I know that she probably liked out class more than others, but she's very fair and incredibly helpful. Can be tough if she doesn't like you, but it isn't hard to get on her good side.",1
Prof. Conta definitely knows what he is teaching. He has real life stories to tell us about every single subject. Very experienced and respected person. Very friendly and interesting. If you are choosing law enf. as a career you must take his AJ 2 class. Best AJ prof in LACC. He will help you pass this class.,1
"Rambles on lectures and jumps around topics. Most things we did or he talked about didn't tie into the topic we were on. Don't have to take notes, won't know what to note down. Even though i didn't really learn much, easy A just do the study guide and study it. Can make up tests. If you want to really learn A&P take someone else otherwise very easy",0
"I took math10 with him. His lecture is really organized. I agree that he is a hard grader, but it is really reasonable. Just go over the notes and homework then A is very attainable.",1
"Im surprised I don't see comments about how inappropriate and problematic this professor is. He talks in circles and his lectures become redundant after week two. He uses awful examples in class to explain his points. Most of his examples are centered around race, politics or class. He also likes to talk about sex, how did we get here again? AVOID.",0
I had her for so many years-- I wish that I still did.,1
"You can tell that she has good intentions, but she simply does not teach the subject well. If you don't go into this class with a very thorough background in Chemistry, you're not going to have a fun time.",0
"Only 4 main speeches and 1 chapter speech from the book. Occasional quizzes from the book/lectures. No impromptus which are nice, only on the 1st day of class. He's a hard grader, and since you have a few speeches you gotta try on all of them. Full class to begin with, but 1/2 as time progressed probs cause his grading and lack of updating grades.",1
"Extremely hyper, hard to follow, lots of information all at once, tests are impossible",1
"Nice guy.  Knows his stuff, loves his job.  The entire class is open to discussion.  Not afraid to give you his OPION.  Will do anything for his students.  Always having some type of midlife crisis.  Never takes responsibilities for his failures.  I wish he was more disciplined, has a brilliant mind.",1
"Her labs are awful. Her classes are okayish but could be better. You read powerpoints, you get the questions from book. You read both book and powerpoints, you have no idea where the questions came from. Tests are hard, not because students don't read it, but because the questions are vague. She does give bonus points , which is the only good thing",0
I can't say enough about Professor Romani. She is awesome and caring and her class is great. I never thought that I would have FUN in a college class while learning.  I wish I could take her for all my classes and I am very lucky I am a major and will have her again.,1
She was one of the most helpful professors I have ever had. She goes above and beyond to make sure her students are clear on everything. Take her whenever possible!,1
"She is really sweet and teaches very well. has a load voice where you can hear her across the room even outside the class room. She wants you to learn and she will help you. you do have to read for PBL, if not you can not do quizzes. test are confusing but you have group projects and labs that help. if you take her you will enjoy it but its alot of",1
"littlejohn sucks, she is not helpful at all, her lectures go by very quickly and are not related at all to the textbook, yet we get tested on the textbook, as well as the web design labs, its like 3 courses in one! with a crappy prof!",0
"I took his summer Calculus II class and it was very organized. He'll spend the extra time to make sure everyone understands what's going on; lectures are straightforward. As long as you keep up with the homework quizzes and tests aren't that bad, though he likes to test on details. Didn't grade too harshly. Really liked his passion for the subject.",1
"She is a very nice and helpful professor. She is by far one of the best. She is very helpful during office hours. Stop by if you do not understand something during class and she will clear it up. Seven homeworks, Seven quizzes, two exams, one 3-4 page term paper. She is by far the best. It makes up for the term paper.",1
"Ratana tries his best & I respect that, but he still falls way short of being an effective professor for 229. This was his first time teaching 229 so I can only hope this was a result of inexperience of teaching this course. His lectures are unclear, unorganized, & he made frequent mistakes. He also posted our full names next to our grades & IDs",0
scariest teacher ever. Don't even bother asking questions because she makes you feel stupid for even asking them. Her course is extremely challenging and she doesn't let you go to the bathroom.,0
"to the prev. rater: i suggest you pay attention in lecture as well as read the text. 1/3 questions from each...the other 1/3 are random, educated guesses needed..not too hard to pull at least a B. curve is insane",0
THIS INSTRUCTOR LOVES TO FAIL STUDENTS! His temperament is not suitable for teaching a introductory painting class. Their grading scale and attendance policy is very strict. This instructor ruined my GPA. THEY TALK ABOUT FAILING STUDENTS IN CLASS!,0
He is the worst prof ever.,0
"He doesn't provide feedback on the quizzes/test, so if you get something wrong, which you most likely will with how strict of a grader he is, it feels extremely bad. All he does for lectures are homework problems and he offers no real guidance for students. If you want an A, it'll be really difficult depending on your own math skills.",0
"I went 15 weeks and didnt even know his name, let alone what he was talking about. discussions are pointless and vague. tests, book and discussions are all so different from one another. 1 paper, midterm, final. I have no idea what I was supposed to even get out of this course. Def wasn't what i thought it was going to be. movies SUCKED.",0
"funny guy, confusing lectures, easy tests",1
"I found Professor Abrams to be unorganized and confusing. Yes- he cares a lot about his students and the course, but that doesn't mean that he's smart or a good teacher. I regret that I did not learn very much from his class.",0
"Wonderful! All homework and quizzes on my accounting lab (like mymathlab) with easy ""help me solve this"" solutions. Miss Errico will help you do any HW probs you need help with. Two tests, you get very similar practice tests to practice on. There is one final paper, I got 100%, just do your research and follow instructions. Don't miss assignments.",1
"Professor was so disengaged in the teaching process. He also played favorites and treated us like high school kids. What an insecure human being. Class consisted of multiple ""projects"" (read: busy work).  Hey Jim! Drink a coffee, anything to wake us up here! Or better yet, go back to Canada!",0
Extremely difficult  tests were over vast quantities of information and the 30 questions on the test were usually not emphasized. To be fair she did email prior to indicate this course was very tough,0
"Just an awful class, if you want to see how to do a class wrong this is it. None of the work that he goes over in class has anything to do with the tests. Thompson is very lazy when it comes to being a professor he puts an absolutely the least amount of effort anybody could possibly put in. All of his tests that trick questions",0
all in all one of the best teachers i have had ,1
"Class was canceled often which was good for relaxing, but not for learning.   His lectures drag on and are hard to follow.  His notes are repetitive and all over the place.  I barely used the textbook, which was a waste of money, and it took forever for him to hand back our essays.  If you have another choice, I would take it.",0
"While he may have +40 years of math experience, his teaching style is if he says it you should understand it.  Further, if you ask questions his answers will include a hint of you learned this in an earlier math class. He goes really fast. In class assignments are developed by him with errors and his problems don't lineup with the textbook.",0
Absolutely awful. 10/10 would not recommend.,0
"I'm another that took his online class. He was always very timly in posting grades and offered timely, constructive feedback. Highly recommended.",1
"Shufeng will be hard to understand for some of the concepts are unclear (especially dealing with quantum mechanics), but is never hesitant about explaining in detail to students and opening his office hours... A lot of the material will be found in his textbooks which will explain some things better.",1
I am in utter shock and dismay after the horrific events that occurred from January-March 2019. This class was absolutely horrendous. Where do I even start? She gives TONS of homework every single week. She even assigns it right after TESTS! Her tests are always the MAXIMUM level of difficulty. Please please please avoid this class if youwanttoLIVE,0
He isn't clear at all. He's an awful teacher. You don't learn anything but the stuff he gives you is already all in French.,0
"Reminds of School, Sending you back if you are 5 mins late to class, i am serious not joking at all! Gives a lot of Quizes and final is cummulative! Trust me guyz dont ever take her class. Lot of studying for low grade!",0
"Not allowed to stand up at all. NO bathroom, NO eating, NO electronics, including if you wish to take notes digitally. His lectures jump around so it makes it difficult to find your appropriate notes when studying for the midterm or final. Studied religiously the study guide for the midterm, did not help at all. 5 books and 5 papers. AVOID!",0
"I enjoyed Professor Lopez's class, he has some unique perspectives on poetry.",1
"This is the hardest English class I have ever had. I had another professor go over a paper with me, critiquing every sentence, and when I turned it in Mrs. Linder gave me a 70. I am normally a straight A student, especially in English. This professor has caused me to change majors.",0
a lot of homework ,0
"This teacher needs to get a clue. I don't know if anybody passed this class with higher than a C.  I don't if she is trying to prove herself, but I seriously didn't learn anything because of her lack of teaching skills.  Essays questions don't make students learn, good teachers make them learn and this teacher doesn't make that mark. DON'T TAKE HER",0
This guy talkes in circles! If you're used to a teahcer who spells it out- he doesn't. Class is actually about sex in bible and other works. VERY boring-most ppl sleep or don't show up. Option to do papers or midterm & final. Mini translation quizes in mid eng. Don't know how you're doing- hands back everything weeks later than when you did it.,0
"I have taken Dr. Wooten for a handful of courses and I wish he could teach them all! He definitely makes you work for your grade, however they are all interesting assignments VERY ORGANIZED and straightforward with what he is asking you to do. He is extremely passionate about Econ and making sure his students attain an education.",1
"Read and ""Practice"" what he gives. Don't study text book. His sample papers will be easy but exam will be really tough and confusing. No assignments. No attendence.  Russian accent. Only problems even though he gives theoretical questions in sample paper. RTT is a must read topic.",0
I was so excited about taking physics until I met this guy. His lectures didn't make any sense. He liked making people look stupid. He used the sample problems from the book for the in class problems. I ended up dropping the course because I couldn't get it. I didn't take the first test but talked to some classmates and most of then got 20-30%!!!,0
"He is the most caring person ever, he is a really good teacher and his ways of explaining math are simple and sometimes funny, 100% recommended.",1
"Dr. K was a really great professor & I liked her a lot for explaining things so you actually understood it & how the building blocks of chemistry works. The only thing I didnt like is that no matter how hard you try, she wont scale or curve. Her practice problems & exams were kinda different/harder from what you see in lecture too",1
"Dr. Borglin is a very nice and caring professor. She is always willing to help her students, always has the time to answer any questions and concerns. Chem is a tough subject but she managed to make it so easy for our online class. Very great professor and would recommend to anyone that is looking to take Chem you will NOT regret it (:",1
"I LOVE Professor Goodman! His voice is really monotone, which isn't great, but he's got a good dry sense of humor. He's really understanding about absences or turning things in a day late if you've got a good reason and usually come to class on time & contribute. He taught me a lot even though I'm not gonna be a PE teacher.",1
Great class. Professor Dutta went above and beyond. I am not a math person and his Videos really helped me learn the material and pass the course. Always available and helpful.,1
Dr. King is not a good professor. He is EXTREMELY disorganized and gets lost in the middle of lecture. The PPTs don't help for studying. He sometimes says random things that only confuse us. Tests are ridiculously hard. No matter how much we studied we scored pretty badly. He's the only one teaching cells so good luck and may you pass the class...,0
"The guy is a pioneer in marketing!  He writes his own material and has an impressive background. His exams are grueling.  They're all open ended, and if you don't put down exactly what he wants he'll dock you.  He is alright with grading. He won't fail you but if you are able to get an A in his class, give yourself a pat on the back.",1
"You can try to work your way out through a problem, but you'll be told to read the book when you asking for help . If you did not get above a B in calc 1, you will struggle, and he has no shame in boasting that he's an inefficient professor.",0
"Great time in this intro class. A few people were in the wrong class since CIS111 is actually the beginner class, not 110. Confusing much? We learned a lot and the Excel section is a great introduction to it's many uses. There was extra credit and bonuses for getting all of the assignments done on time. She wasn't easy by any means, you earn it. ",1
"Sincerely hope no-one ever has to get this prof ever again. He is quite possibly the worst I have ever encountered.  Refuses to actually help students, belittles students, and is very sarcastic.  He should, without question, be fired.",0
"Olsson had the potential to be a great teacher but unfortunately, she was not super accessible. She would not respond to emails nor the discussion board she put up for questions. Her grading is very arbitrary and often would not give feedback. I would have learned more if she cared more about her student's learning experience.",0
She failed to teach things well to the point I learned more about U.S history in my Africa class. She spent two whole days going over Indians in the new world and spent maybe five minutes on the American revolution. Her class is random crap she decides to talk about. She repeats things differently and goes too fast. Powerpoints were useless.,0
okay,1
"I took class with him .... the you really need to be regular in math classes especially with Martin.. His quizes and exams are really easy but his teaching method is terrible cus he only understands for himself.. pay more attention when he teaches row reduction, span,bases, eigen value etc...",0
Very nice professor and wants you to succeed. Make sure you understand coursework and do recitations and homework.,1
I AM AN A/B STUDENT AND PROBABLY GETTING A C OR D IN THIS CLASS.  DOES THIS TELL YOU ANYTHING?,0
"Professor Sieber is amazing. BIOLOGY is not easy because it has a lot of material to cover, but she goes over and over the material until we understand it. Also the test are part multiple choice and part short answer, and there is ton of extra credit. Don't skip class because you would be lost. The book is needed but no the access code.",1
You will be lucky to stumble upon one or two professors like Dr. Cote throughout your college career. Chemistry is the science that aims to understand how all the stuff in and around you works and changes. Cote is the field guide you need on this particular safari. She will take you through difficult terrain and show you the wonders along the way.,1
Knows what he is talking about for sure. Not an easy class though. Don't mess around,1
"This is one of the worst classes I have taken at the U. Berger gave a quiz during dead week. Made countless mistakes when teaching the material and class was not very helpful. The first three weeks of class were pointless, learning about the history of computers that and never being quizzed or tested on this material.",0
"At first, I dreaded taking this class due to many of the negative ratemyprofessor posts. As it turned out, she was a very understanding and helpful professor -- one of the best I have had at WPU. Yes, you have to read and think critically about the text, but this is college -- that's what is expected of you!",1
"Don't get me wrong this class is not hard at all. If you do all the chapter reviews, online quizzes and papers you will get an A in the class. The midterm and final is easy. I never went to class because the professor was mono tone and not engaging at all.",0
Just got hired as a 3rd grade elementary school teacher in a charter and find myself drawing on many of the ideas I learned from taking this class into my instructions. Technology was heavy in this class and now I use technology a lot in my class. The professor is smart and supportive. Met with him a few occasions I needed extra help.,1
"Poor teaching skills. He himself has trouble teaching the material. On multiple occasions the students had to correct him on problems. Has very little knowledge of what he is teaching. Most of the course grade is from 3 tests. If you are not very good at math, I STRONGLY suggest that you do not take his class. Save yourself the trouble!",0
Karen is a great professor. She is always willing to help out when I have questions and she keeps chemistry fun! It's a lot of work but if you are willing to put in the effort you will get a good grade. Best professor I have ever had!,1
Glad to have her as an advisor.,1
"She always hands out updated deadlines for assignments. Assignments are typically very simple. Expect to do group work. Expect to have a big powerpoint/paper at end of class in place of a final. Good instructor, she has lots of career experience. I would recommend her/take her again.",1
"He is a very intelligent teacher. If you do your homework, you will get a good grade. There are about 4 papers you have to write, but he is extremely helpful. He really cares about his students. He likes telling stories so class isn't always dull. I recommend him!",1
"Really funny professor, his lectures were always very entertaining, there was so many MEMES! The only down side with him is that you have to read sooo much in order to pass the exams which are written exams not mc. Attendance is 25% of you grade so definitely cant skip, offers a lot of ec so take advantage of it, no homework except to read",1
Nice enough prof but she strays from the topics and the text and slides used are extremely dry. Gave no real indication of what might come on her tests or how they would work besides saying they were written exams.,0
"Overall he is a good Professor. He does care for you, he wants you to learn and pass. I've leaned this by being in his class, I can tell by his great personality. So do the work, participate in class, and you'll be just fine.",1
Very kind and helpful professor!,1
"Disgustingly strict, bad lecturer, doesnt answer hw probs throughly. I feel like there are still a lot of things I dont know before each midterm.",0
"This is the worst class I have ever taken. The only available Comm 230 section was a 180 student lecture with Cindy White. Worst professor. Attendance is pointless because she goes so off topic and the Powerpoints do not help! Your grade is based off only 3 tests, not leaving you any room for mistakes. All she does it babble.",0
"Wonderful person, but horrible teacher. Does not actually lecture, but she will play video upon video. She does not teach. Her tests are ridiculously hard and are all short answer/essay. The first test was 32 short answer/essay questions!!!! You will have to teach yourself AND finish the ridiculous repetitive and useless online biology homework.",0
"Just take class with someone else. If you have children, a job, any other responsibilities, if you have any form of ADD/ADHD. You will fail. The amount of information your expected to absorb and retain is unreasonable for the time frame. The amount of writing is ridiculous. Lets face it, your not at Harvard its GCTCS. She doesnt act accordingly.",0
"Not an easy class or Professor. She requires 8 books but you only need 2 of the novels. She talks fast and everything you're tested on is based on notes (I usually got 5-7 pages/class). Because she talks so much and gets off topic, the amount of things you need to study for exams is insane. She'll do everything in her power to not give you an A.",0
"He is honestly one of the best professors I've ever had.  He's incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable, but really funny and nice too.  Wish he could teach every class!",1
"Personable professor but the way she teaches is awful. Did not have a course outline, made up assignments along the way and did not stay on course topic enough. Always late and was a tough grader in a course that was meant to be a grade booster. She asked us what we wanted to have for assignments during the class. Multiple things due at same time.",0
Lectures can get boring. He doesn't take attendances but gives pop quizzes sometimes. Gives study guides before exams. Exams aren't open-book so you actually have to study to ace. ,1
"Take this professor if you wan't to become any form of a writer or poet. If that is not you, avoid this guy's class. He does not care for any reason or excuse you may have for missing a class or doing something in a way he doesn't want done. I was one of 3 kids who passed with a C or better out of a class that began w 30-40 students. Good luck",0
Makes it incredibly difficult to understand your own grade. Not a clear grader. Incredibly picky on tests.,0
Dr. Mark was absolute hell to deal with. This courseload is beyond ridiculous and she is not understanding about you being in another classes that require your time. She does not respond to emails and if she does she is beyond rude to you and does not offer any help. There are major projects due each week. Her husband also attends every class.,0
Excellent teacher - very helpful - very easy to work with - cares about the student and goes out of her way to help them,1
"Professor Bledsoe is an amazing instructor. He is extremely knowledgeable about creative writing, which is the course I took. He gave numerous good tips for writing creatively and each lecture was unique and exciting. Definitely recommend this course, no matter what your major is.",1
He is a great man TAKE HIM,1
"At first it was boring & monotone but towards the end you notice his humor, he's really funny, I enjoyed this class and lowkey kinda miss it!",1
"She was horrible, she treated and 1101 class like a grad class..she doesnt care about anyone and will willfully fail the entire class.",0
I had Dr. Venus for one semester and he was great! He was a little slow when it came to getting grades back but he had great classes! He was always making jokes and making class fun! I always enjoyed his classes and looked forward to them! He would always help you if you got stuck on finding a topic or needed help when writing your essays!,1
"Was not very helpful, made me not enjoy sign language as I enjoyed it very much for 1010. She will call people out in front of the class and has a very short temper and extremely inpatient. Not the best teacher for trying to learn a new language, as she expects you to know almost every sign there is.",0
He doesn't excuse being sick even if you have a note. Almost never uses chalkboard. You do homework online and its very disorganized. I had to contact Dr. Baretta for specific webpage as the prof required it but had no idea how to assist us.  He is not helpful and is never at his office during office hours. It's pathetic. Good luck if you take him.,0
"Do ALL the suggested textbook problems! This is what allowed me to do good on the midterms and final. There are no surprises, he cares about the success of each of his students. Such a nice old man. Loved him dearly. I wished he taught the rest of the series.",1
We were suppose to have mini quizzes about each reading. Right before the final she decided to cut them out of her grading criteria. I needed help with an essay and scheduled a meeting with her. She cancelled last minute and when I emailed her my question she didn't respond until the day before it was due. She was also late daily and unorganized,0
"Honestly, this class was terrible. I did not understand anything and he went too fast to give me a chance to keep up. I do not recommend.",0
She's a great professor! It's a pretty easy class but you learn a lot. She's extremely caring and knowledgeable about the subject. She wrote the text book and it has review questions in the back. Take her!!,1
"Beware of Mrs. Wang's math classes. You need to be well-versed in the subject. She does not provide a platform for C students. She delves into Matrices and Linear Programming. Taking precious time away from more applicable math subjects. Just keeping it real. Also, you will notice that she does not have 23 people on her waitlist!",0
Dr Schwartz definitely cares about the students.  He wants you to do well by learning the material. Had extra classes to help and even had a special class on a Saturday.  He's there for you if you study. I'd take him again,1
"Terrible teacher! He made everyone in the class hate math. Worse teacher ever, if you have the chance to choose do NOT take him. He thinks he is funny, and his jokes suck.",0
"LOVE this class! My favorite by far! Fultz knows his stuff, watch out for the final it's over the whole semester! I can't say enough good about him. I wish I could take his class for all of my Biol classes!!",1
"He is a great professor but his class includes long lectures everyday and there is a lot of reading outside of class. If you don't do the reading it will be tough, especially for the in class clicker questions. There are a few quizzes that are heavily weighed.",1
"If you are not a poli-sci major do not take this class unless you have nothing to do but read and write papers every week. Assigns papers as if his class is the only thing I have to worry about, took time away from classes that matter for my major. He's a nice guy and clearly passionate about what he teaches, but this class made me miserable.",0
"Holly is not even a professor. If you wish to waste all your school fee, go ahead. I haven't learn anything from her. She only cares about white people and extremely loves talking about herself which is waste of time and doesn't even teach a thing and gives unclear instructions with ridiculous feed back and you will end up with full of regrets.",0
Do not take a class with this professor!!!!! She is unorganized and unfair. Her tests are mostly written answer and what you put down is sure to be wrong. If you ask a question or see her after class she will talk in circles never giving you any clarity. Avoid this women you will struggle!!!!,0
"She... sucks. She's not a good proffessor at all. She will spend 70% of class time rambling incoherently about her life in Spain. Very liberal. She's immature and disrespectful if you dare to counter her liberal views. Tests are hard. Spends last minutes of class doing what we're supposed to, and keeps us there assigning last minute past class time",1
"This is one class I actually don't mind going to. Most of the books you have to read are decent and the class is actually interesting. The papers are a pain but doable. You pretty much have to go to class bc there are 6 in class pop quizzes, but they're really easy if you do the reading.",1
By far the worst teacher. dont expect to get more than 70 percent on the essays. Will literally mark you down for the smallest things. ,0
"Great teacher; really know his stuff and has real world experience which, in this field, is priceless. Never uses the book and all the tests are based on his notes. Very easy class if you take good notes and study them for each class. You will learn a lot, too!",1
"I took this class (Law, Politics, & Justice) in Russell's first semester teaching it, so it wasn't very organized yet--but  it was super fun and low-stress. She picks hot topics to discuss each week (ex. gun control, death penalty) and you read and then discuss & write a short reflection paper. Most fun political theory class available.",1
"HORRIBLE!! DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN. He hates life. Never happy. It's his way or no way. You opinion doesn't matter. Have no idea how he still teaches there. He will give you a zero for wrong format, wrong folder, if he doesn't like your opinion. Should not teach. He hates everything. He's the devil of English. He enjoys being miserable. No sympathy!",0
"Guerra could not have made this an easier class. I didn't even use a textbook, just his lecture and powerpoint. Grading is 1/3 attendance survey, 1/3 quizzes, 1/3 final paper. No tests ever. He is very passionate about law. Class fully based on Facebook movie ""The social network"".",1
Dowell is very knowlegable and passionate about this course. Readings from the textbook are mandatory and questions from the reading homework appear on the tests. The class is pretty straightforward.,1
She is a very understanding and approachable professor who teaches the material in class clearly and effectively. Shes willing to work with you to help you get the grades you need to pass if you're struggling. Gives small extra credit incentives.,1
There really isn't that much homework.  There are only three test but they are hard.  His reviews suck not helpful at all.  He just expects that you know this stuff bc he is used to teaching higher level course.,0
"This was a 1 credit course that was super interesting. Nic knows the city of Rome like the back of his hand - extremely knowledgeable and well respected. Take a class with him, and go talk to him in office hours. He's a pretty cool dude!",1
"So far my favorite communication course and instructor. She is so down to earth and willing to help students. While this class was writing intensive - it was a lot of work but still enjoyable. If you have to take this class, definitely take it with her!",1
His Intro Biology class is very hard. He told class that if you need help study he would help. when I was failing the class I went to his office a few times. He just went over the tests it didn't really help me. Hard for him to explain things. Most of the time in class we just take notes which aren't very helpful for the test. Withdrawal the class.,0
"He assigns weekly readings, which range from 20 to 200pgs, although you don't even have to read them, because he explains all of the important material during class. He provides a worksheet each class period, then uses those questions on the midterm & final. Several (4) papers throughout, including one group essay. Pray he likes your writing style",1
"He doesn't really teach anything. He likes to give his political opinion as factual information. He's a great guy but he will tell straight up lies and have you write it down as fact. If you genuinely care about preserving History accurately, do not take his class. I regret it.",1
Barcley is definitely a professor of a different breed. He is very entertaining during class and extremely helpful whether in class or out. He pushes you to join competitions and classes that can make you a better entrepreneur. He offers credit for IDK as an answer to test questions and allows you to write your own test question. Inspiring!,1
"Reads directly from the slides, few relevant examples, too many assignments",0
"Took online course.  He outsources the lectures to videos someone did years ago.  His notes are horrible, terrible spelling, pieced together.  He gives little time during testing.  Impossible to get it all done. Doesn't respond to emails, EVER.  The only thing HE actually does is grade the exams and screw you on your final grade.",0
"If Humber is teaching the class you want, take it with him. He's able to explain even the hardest of concepts in a clear, concise way and then follows up with examples to further solidify your understanding. His tests can be tough, but he gives a ton of partial credit. To top it off, he's got a great sense of humor/really cares about his students.",1
"Very nice guy, and appropriately funny. My GOD does this guy give harder exams. Just like Horstmann grading structure. Class average on first exam was 21/50 but half the class did ereally well and other half did not. Too much assignment u wouldnt finish unless only taking 2 classes that semester. After exam 1 and 3 HW I was discouraged to work hard",0
"As long as you turn in your essay on time, you will get a B no matter how awful it truly is. To get an A in the class, you really have to work for it. She does not have a rubric that tells you how each essay is graded. You won't learn a thing in this class.",0
"Barbara was one of the worst professors I've had. Her notes are very dense, aren't really in order sometimes and very confusing for a first level course. Very hard marker, not clear on what she expects. In order to understand the material, expect to teach yourself. Several in class quizzes but the answers you could never get. avoid her if possible.",0
"Gives candy out to everyone. Can be tough on grading, but teaches and explains things well. If he likes you, you'll get an A. Ask questions whenever possible, he'll help you. On final, he expects you to use all you've learn in class and use it on that.",1
"Mr. S. is one of the best instructors I've had during my 3 years at SLU. His lectures are clear and easy to follow.  Quizzes are easy if you've done the reading. Exams are reasonable and there are great study guides. You can tell he's excited about the material. Overall, a fun class!",1
aunave gives easy exams but is hard to understand.  not very helpful and is strict about attendance.  asks for homework randomly which is way lame.  very easy grader though.,0
"Not the greatest professor out there. He just talks about the HISTORY of physics but doesn't teach or how to solve physic problems, and all his test are equations and problems!  The exams are no really similar to his reveiws either.  I'd take Prof. Johnson instead.",0
"He is a very nice guy, but he has trouble explaining things. I didn't learn much from him, had to learn it all on my own. His test are not to bad he is great at giving partial credit. If you are not really good at physics I would not recomend taking him.",1
"2nd time taking him and still one of my favorite professors. He's a hysterical guy so even though he has the most monotone voice ever he still keeps class interesting. Exams aren't too different from slides and in-class exercises, but his projects are the absolute worst. He also doesn't give back all your grades so I don't know why I got what I got",1
Mrs Schultz was a good teacher she is kinda hard to understand at times but she gives good lectures and will help you at any time,1
"Professor Jacobo provides studentsclients NEGATIVE ENERGY. Read ahead and don't procrastinate. Your educating yourself with this professor, because she provides zero support.",0
"She is very sweet and truly cares about every student in the class.  She is very educated and passionate about special education, which makes her a great professor.  Her quizzes are very easy, and as long as you put effort into the assignments, you will get an A.",1
Very unclear and unorganized. Couldn't understand what he was saying half the time. When you ask for help his explanations were even more confusing than the problem.  He is a smart man but doesn't know how to teach. AVOID at all costs if you need to move to a higher chemistry class. ,0
"Suann was a good professor, she tends to go into detail on topics because she is very passionate about the material. Lectures are powerpoints mixed with group interaction that tend to be fairly engaging. Definitely a fair, and overall solid professor. Getting an A is not easy but not impossible if you pay attention and study.",1
"Hardest teacher ever, genious",1
"Nice and enthusiastic, but also difficult and goes far too fast in lectures. There is also an unreasonable amount of online homework. ",1
"Unfair and rude. If he likes you, you will do well on his class, there were only 2 exams during the semester. Make sure you talk to him and praise him, he likes to feel important and he loves it if you tell him that you love his books.  2 students can have the same exact answers on the exam, but grades will be based on whether he likes you or not",0
"Professor Stevenson, in my opinion, is one of the best professors at QU. She is so nice and very easy to schedule a meeting with if the information is unclear. Definitely take her if you get the chance!",1
"Took this course as a birdcourse but it was NOT because of the prof. The course content was SO easy but the exams and MARKING was UNFAIR. I think Natalie would be a better prof if this wasn't an online course, she was helpful during the ""field trip"" but was so hard to reach through email. The quizzes, test, and field trip really boost ur mark tho!",0
"This was honestly the worst class I have ever taken and it has nothing to do with the course itself. The lectures were great but often times the professor would cancel the class last minute, change assignments or just never grade your exams. I, as well as many others, still don't have a grade for my last semester from him. It's almost February. ",0
She does not grade fairly. Very poor teaching skills. I would not take her class again. Most people dropped the course.,0
"she is very unclear, very unorganized and sometimes has an attitude with students after they dont understand her. she likes art though, and it shows. if you like writing and unclarity, take her art criticism.",0
Celia is an extremely tough prof. As a science student who is used to getting a lot of work-don't be fooled she gives a LOT of homework. She is really strict and for some reason thinks no one in the class studies and puts in effort while everyone is struggling and crying. I think I've had maybe 3-4 nice cry sessions from her class. Not worth it.,0
"He is one of the best math teachers Ive had. He goes out his way to make sure you understand whats going on. Hes a very brilliant professor. Hell even bring in snacks to class. Like cupcakes before spring break! If you have to take stats, I highly recommend him. He returns emails pretty quickly as well.",1
I hate him with a passion. Don't take him. He sucks.,0
"She is an amazing teacher and her class is not hard. She takes attendance, but only to learn your name. It is not for a grade. She does a lot of fun activities in class. She was seriously one of my favorite classes to go to. She assigns kind of a lot of group projects, but they are not hard. I would highly recommend her!!!!",1
Raquel is the most misleading professor i have ever had. She does not accept excused absences if you've missed class more than 3 times. there is a quiz almost every week and they are ridiculously hard. if you do not openly support her personal beliefs than you will not receive participation points even if you show up to class. DO NOT recommend,0
"Definitely one of my Top 2 professors at Tufts. Great in lecture, on average just 3 hours of hw per week, and awesome guy in general. Tests are tough to most people but they are definitely fair. As long as you do some of the practice exams, take notes and pay attention in lecture, and do the hw, you'll do great!",1
"makes a lot of unfunny jokes which come off as mean especially to students, goes off tangent often in lectures, feedback isn't helpful, readings assigned are difficult to write on for his expectations on essays,",0
She gave good lecture and was easy to ask questions. This class is one of the hardest at Pierce. This semester was tough online and knowing that she still wouldnt round anyones grade who had a 79 or 89. The mental stress from this class is exhausting and having so many assignments doesnt help you study. She only gave us 4 days to study for final,0
"Prof. Infante is super enthusiastic, kind, and reasonable. World Lit challenged my thinking but was never too stressful, and he both gave great lectures and made sure the discussions went somewhere. You can tell that he loves the subject matter, and he is really willing to help with papers. If you put in effort, your worldview will expand a lot!",1
Couldn't ask for a better instructor. Wish she could find time to teach more classes like micro;),1
This class is the reason why I am a better writer than I was in high school. Tom cares so much about his students and truly wants them to succeed. This is by far one of the hardest classes I have ever taken but I wouldn't have wanted to take it with anyone else.,1
Worst Professor. Her teaching is only for those she favors. She is really mean and has a very bad attitude. She acts really tough and bossy mainly because she is the director of the theater program.,0
"Easy, fun and interesting class that's completely self-guided & self-paced, you just complete all 5 open-book exams (the only things graded & the lowest of the 5 is dropped) by a certain date 10 weeks into the semester. You can spend very little time on it and get an A, but if you actually want to learn the stuff you'll spend lots of time reading!",1
Awesome,1
"He's an awesome professor, he's just kinda, the chem professor version of a football coach. He does post his lectures online, but I would suggest being there since sometimes stuff doesn't make it to the online version.",1
"I have had the opportunity to take two classes with Dr. Buhler.  He has high expectations and often teaches classes that would be demanding despite those, but if you put in the effort you will leave the class impressed with what you managed to learn in a semester.  If you're expecting to coast through 584 or 541, I must urge caution.",1
"Washburn is a very fair teacher and enjoys teaching. She is always Nice to students, goes over everything in detail, and is very relatable. Do your homework and be respectful, that's it. Her class is informative and interesting, and she likes doing group activities. The tests and homework are not hard as long as you are attentive. Do not be late.",1
"Worst professor ever. Very boring and unorganized lectures. Adam has zero passion and doesn't seem like he wants to be there. Equation sheets aren't allowed on tests, no partial credit and review days are a joke. Material isn't that difficult but tests are you're whole grade and he makes them as hard as he possibly can. Avoid this professor",0
she was amazing,1
This class was useless. It was an absolute waste of time. It took time away from my family and now that I am student teaching many of the master teachers I have talked about this class to have found her assignments outdated and laughable. Best of luck on your 10 day science unit outline. You will never ever use that again.,0
Do all of your homework. ALL OF IT. Only way you'll survive. Study the chapter study guides. Only way you'll pass. Avoid if possible.,0
"General Physics at Umass Lowell was hands down the worst educational experience of my life, the professors are inept and incompetent. The lectures don't match the recitation, which doesn't match the labs. The Umass Physics department is the biggest sorry excuse for higher education I've even had the misfortune to be a part of.  F's across the board",0
"All I can say about Professor Thompson is lazy, save yourself time energy and aggravation and take a different class.",0
"Great,funny instructor. Great role-player, be ready for therapeutic communication. One of the most emotional lectures you will have. You will feelknow that she has passion and that she cares about students. ",1
"I took Stats after being out of school for 10 years almost. Mr. huff does an amazing job of explaining the material and spending the time needed to see others succeed. Study is necessary, but he gives you all the tools you need! Great professor! Highly recommend.",1
I took a class that was a boring subject but he somehow made it interesting. Super funny and laid back.,1
I would take a chance on another teacher. She doesnt respond to emails in a timely manner and rarely gives any positive feedback. She does not give clear explanations and sometimes rude to students on the discussion boards. She offered no insights or tips during her weekly videos and read word for word the assignments for the upcoming week.,0
"Thus far, he is my favorite online professor. He is very organized and responds to emails very fast. He looks out for students; he dropped a reading and extended deadlines. The course itself is interesting and the assignments aren't too bad. I have a full time job and a full load in school and it's still fairly easy. Highly recommended! TAKE HIM :)",1
"Professor Bowlin is the laziest teacher ive ever had. She hasnt taught us anything in class, she just has the students continually present powerpoints to do her job for her. In the other class i have with her, she just sits on the podium and reads from the book the whole class while she told us to buy it cause we ""need it"" I would avoid her",0
She was very helpful with homework and quizzes. Helps you work the problems you missed for 5 percentage points.,1
"Terrible. Exams were extremely difficult because the lectures involve no actual learning. His lecture style is very dry, unfunny, and not helpful at all. His accent is sometimes incomprehensible. The other instructor for this class, Dr. Storch, was much more organized and presented the material in a very clear and understandable fashion.",0
"Horrible professor. Makes it seem like he's available outside of class but, doesn't even come to meetings schedule by email. Grades very hard on exams!!! The homework is worth 25% of the final grade. Lecture is boring and awful. Prepare to teach yourself. If your reading this, DONT TAKE HIM!!!!!!!",0
She is va very tough grader!,0
"His class was easy and had a routine schedule. It was easy to keep track of assignments. Quizzes and discussions are due on Sunday nights, but you have all week to do them.",1
He is a great professor!!He teaches you about the reality of life. His stories were amazing and his exams were mostly from his power points. He get's the class involved and ask you questions that makes you think twice about what you can do to make a difference in your field.It is impossible to not get an A in his class.,1
"Shes the best of the best, class isnt boring its fun every time! Shes super nice, shes awesome and you wont regret taking her class.",1
What an ego! I aced this class but the structure was awful and he only seemed concerned with all the work he was going to have with the grading and editing the final product. Not really what the students could do.   He doesn't respond to emails. Rarely gives anybody besides other tenured professors the time of day. ,0
"AWESOME PROF, REALLY EASY IF YOU STUDY! REPLACES EXAM GRADES IF YOU IMPROVE! TAKE HER CLASS!!!",1
"Professor Nia C. Mahallati, J.D.-PROC 5840-Legal Acquisitions Graduate Law course at Webster. Recommend attending all class sessions as tests based on class materials. Very informative class, exceptional professor. Provides extensive coverage of Uniform Commercial Code (Sale of Goods). Highly recommend this graduate law course and professor.",1
"Yates is a wonderful and competent professor! You can definitely learn a lot from her if you just listen. She provides all the slides and key terms for the tests. Her lectures are interesting and informative and her experience in the field is noteworthy. Do the work, listen, study, and appreciate having an amazing professor.",1
Good teacher who likes what she's doing. The labs she gives are interesting but long. Cool class with good lectures.,1
"At the beginning of the class she told us she didn't like the new curriculum. We wrote on one topic the whole time and if she took the opposing view point, she would make it known that she didn't agree with you. She grades based on her own thoughts and she isn't very clear on what she is looking for in the papers.",0
I took Bushey for lecture online and it was by far my hardest class. I would study for the quizzes so much and take a lot of notes while watching his lecture videos and still fail most of the quizzes. Theres a quiz every thurs worth a lot of points and he gives u barely any time. Dont take him unless your super confident and dont mind stress.,0
"Doesn't care much for students teacher does not help those in need only the ""teachers pets"" wouldn't recommend taking ANY classes from her",0
He is probably the chillest teacher Ive had.,1
"She does not teach nor lecture labs are a joke , Im seriously pissed I picked this course with her, its overwhelming like its your only class , each chapter homework question are 100+ she has you doing 8pge summaries for each chapter . 1-8 and then you have labs and TEST !! DO NOT TAKE THIS LADY, this is not my 1st year , but she is the worst!",0
"DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES. She expects you read more than hundreds pages before every lectures. Her lectures is the most boring I had ever have in UW, also the most unclear. I don't understand why UW would hire her. She is not even community college level professor.",0
He's smart but he is too intense when he is in his lectures. He doesn't care that you have other classes and assignments because he only gives you mon - fri to do a long and hard assignment. I have not had one assignment that was interesting. Nice guy but makes me regret going towards my major in english since he has taught me nothing at all.,0
"I LOVE JASON PREY!!! AMAZING teacher. very hands on and very passionate about what he does. He will help you if you need it. It isn't an easy class though, you have to put in the work. If you're going to take A&P it is a MUST to take it with this professor! He makes the lectures so entertaining.. you can't wait to come to class every day!",1
Worst professor I have ever had at UB . I wish there were more professors teaching this course that are inspirational and encouraging to their students. If you take him be prepared to have a semester filled of stress and depression. It does not matter how much you try he will always find problems with your work and just wants more and more.,0
"Professor Sherwood is really awesome. If you have problems, talk to her. She is very open and is willing to listen. There is a Research paper that is a major part of your grade, Aplia questions, and a discussion most weeks. If you respond to the students and her, it will be easy.",1
Great professor! Even though the project s are a lot harder than the midterm and final.,1
Amazing teacher. The only class I looked forward to.,1
"I am learning absolutely nothing. He is rude, inconsiderate, and heartless. Luckily he means absolutely nothing in the real world of show business. If you have him just know that.",0
"Professor Dunham started out great, was very clear of his expectations and grading criteria. But a few weeks into class he had a family emergency, and we didn't hear from him for weeks. We couldn't get feedback until almost all assignments were turned in. Grades more on APA style than actual content, very tough grader! Good Professor though.",1
Glenn is great. The only thing is that no one likes 3 hour lectures. He is funny and really good at explaining concepts. He prepares you exceptionally well for his exams.,1
"Honestly, I really expected more from this Professor given that he has really good reviews but Im really disappointed. His lectures were clear for the most part but the hw/tests werent always representative to the lectures. He throws curve balls. He doesnt really reply to emails either. This class was not really enjoyable whatsoever:(",0
"Dr Mavica is AMAZING, her class is 4 grades, the 3 exams and the online homework, each 25%, she gives extra credit towards exams from iclicker questions in class, do not slack on exams since they are essentially only grades going in, lectures are info heavy but just go to the class, it is worth the extra credit",1
"This class requires a lot of tough thinking and sharing your opinions, as well as giving speeches both in front of the class and recorded but Prof Gentry makes it enjoyable and interesting.",1
"Nice guy, open to meet with you after class to go over your assignments. A little boring and monotone voice, but he tries his best considering the dry material A lot of group activities Marks hard",1
One of best classes I've taken! Makes you work to help you understand. Activities are fun and exams or not bad if you study! Helps in any way he can! TAKE HIM!!!,1
"One of the best teachers at OSU, so nice and helpful!",1
"I thought she was fair and you got the grade with what you put into it. The project is important. Easy to understand course. You do have to understand the syllabus though well and don't turn in the assignments late. There is a lot of reading, she does have videos posted for the first five chapters of the course.",1
"Took this class online and it wasn't that difficult. If you put in the time and study for the midterm and final, you will pass the class. The only bad thing about this class is the midterm and final make up 40% of your grade. Overall, it's an easy class if you study and put in the work.",1
"Even if you need to take him for accounting 101 DO NOT. Very nice guy, joking and funny but not a single class I payed attention in and makes a difficult class even more difficult to try and learn. Strictly shows youtube videos that we could look up ourselves",0
"I have been out of school for 23 years, so I was feeling scared . Prof Barkley is amazing. He is very knowledgeable, well prepared, and passionate for teaching. He gets out of his way to make sure that EVERY student understand and pass his class. He has prepared power point, test reviews, recording, and exercises for the student.",1
"Overbearing, pompous, and shortsighted. That's to say the least. I work twenty five hours a week off campus and was unlucky enough to have two bouts with MRSA, and she still gave me a bad attendance grade, regardless of my ER papers from the hospital. She's abrasive, very hard grader, and unrelenting. Do not take her unless you are a masochist.",1
Wonderful teacher!!! He helps you understand if you don't quite get it and he wants EVERYONE to succeed! Wish I had him this semester!!,1
I took this class as an online summer course and it was very straightforward. There were 2 exams and 3 discussions with two replies and weekly 20 question quiz. Professor Shan graded weekly and provided positive feedback. I enjoyed the class! Take it if you need a class.,1
"This class is very difficult, we're completely online you gotta learn everything on your own. Hw will take a long time. The test is insanely difficult and has no correlation to what we learn or the hw which is so annoying, the curve is really big bc of that but I wouldnt rec anyone take her unless you wanna study 3 hours every week on your own",0
"Out of the 20+ graduate courses I have taken, this has been the worst class. A lot of (outdated) readings (especially for an instructor who insists materials for the course paper be no more than 5 years old). Minimal work for a grad course. Not challenging for a graduate course either. And who gives tests at the graduate level??",0
I loved his lectures and the reading material wasn't too bad. There are few assignments and they are pretty easy if you keep up with the lectures and reading. I would definitely recommend him.,1
It blows me away that this is a foundations course. It was by far my lowest grade. She marks this assignments like English papers and if it is not absolutely perfect then she throws a 65 on the paper. Do not take foundations 201 with her you will regret it.,0
"Her concern for all of us truly makes me feel like she actually cares about the human beings we are. The way she teaches this class, audio lectures coupled with her personality toward me, made all the difference in completing this course.",1
"Professor royce is amazing , he teaches everything which i upto trend that will definitely be useful for a professional career.",1
"Attendance isn't mandatory, he grades the homework for completeness, he gives credit on exams as long as you put an answer, no extra credit given unless you are borderline with your grade, for example, A/B",1
"Going into this class I was excited to learn about philosophy but coming out of it, I don't think I will ever take another philosophy class again and if I do it will definitely not be with Jeff. He's an easy grader but will tell students that their opinions are wrong and force them to agree with his own opinions by arguing with what they have said.",0
No Comments,0
Lakin Khan is a great English teacher. She helped me improve in writing and taught the whole class in a positive learning environment. She is one of the teachers that really make a difference in her student's lives. I have learned a lot from her and all of our assignments and I am glad I have gotten her as a teacher. She puts in a lot of hard work,1
"Always show up to classes. There are regular assignments. She offers a lot of reading, but it's all articles. So no textbooks needed. She really makes it clear she wants to be there. Health econ can be a bit dry, but she incorporates a lot of relevant stuff for today. It was a great class",1
"Dr. Zeng's class was a very difficult subject but she helped us understand the materials with homework, team class exercises, and quizzes. The students knew exactly what to study or exams. She is passionate about economics and is very accessible outside class. I would definitely recommend taking a class with her.",1
"Deb Fels utilized a series of guest lectures in lieu of presenting course materials. The guest lectures represented related content; it did not explain the concepts of the course text book. The final exam was 100% from the textbook. I know I did not Fel the exam, but I did not do as well as I could have with lectures on course material.",0
"Easy A, great easy going prof. He even hangs out with students and hears all their complains. He is very supportive and helps you improve your grade by talking to your profs. Very nice person, he is always in his office, so if you want to learn and get grades, make sure you see him every week in his office - he or Gaby are there for you to help.",0
"Prof. Conta is absolutely the best, informative, entertaining, caring teacher in the administrative dept at LACC. He is a true gem. He is so human, humble, and yet, so spectacular....one of a kind.",1
"Took this online over the summer... It was extremely difficult without lecture, because the structure of class is to just do a ton of readings and then answer questions on Skype and write an essay about the readings (at the end of each week). It may work for some people, but I feel like I didn't learn that much or get a good grade.",0
"Very quiet teacher and it seemed like he didn't know what he was talking about half of the time. He just read off of slides. He mentioned class is pointless, but it's just a prerequisite. 60% of the grade is from exams; he gives study guides, but the exams are nothing like the study guides. He curves class average to a 75% on exams and final.",0
"She is a very nice lady who is obviously very passionate about her field. Her section of the IMIN371 exams were more or less fair (in that she tested from what she taught), but expect to study A LOT for her exam just due to the sheer amount of material to memorize. Every detail counts.",1
"The class setup is very straightforward. Prof Bachmann gives feedback on work posted. It is easy but if you miss too many assignments, it's easy to slip down a letter grade. She is very easy to reach. Replies quickly to emails.",1
Fantastic professor! She breaks the material down in her lectures and slideshows making it all much easier to learn and understand. Just don't be late or get behind in the readings.,1
By far the hardest class I have ever taken. Never have liked his attitude. Don't be fooled by his niceness on day one. He belittles students in class for asking questions. LOTS of papers due that take tons of time. Be prepared. Worst teacher I've ever had. You won't feel confident in your work. Does not encourage you and makes you hate  the subject,0
"A bit eccentric, but patient with students and explains course material clearly. Great Professor! Material is not hard if you go to class.",1
"I took Prof. Mihill for ASCI 490. (Capstone) This class was extremely difficult, however, Prof. Mihill is such an amazing teacher.  He was extremely helpful and patient and replied to my questions within a day, because communication is imperative while taking this class. I can't say enough good things andwould absolutely take this Professor again.",1
"Very nice teacher. class'll get hard but he explains everything crystal clear. he always took time to explain an extra problem after class to make sure I understood the material. Taking notes is mandatory in order to pass but all problems he writes in class are literally the tools to you'll need for HW, quizzes & exams! would take again w/o a doubt",1
"Shara is a great designer and you can tell this by her passion for the craft, shes a wealth of knowledge of you know what questions to ask. Shes always open to talking and bouncing ideas off of",1
Lecture was long and tedious..........,0
I dropped this course and decided to take it instead with Raney over the summer and it was the BEST decision I could have made. She found a way to make calculus easy and relevant to SLHS majors and I am so happy I took this course with her. She took a class of students with math phobia and made them feel relaxed and I truly feel like i learned.,1
Great teacher except for his damn russian accent,0
Prof. Jagpal is very brilliant. This class gives you very good understanding of Marketing. Use his book and you will get most out of the teaching. Not an easy class and you need to work with him. Don’t be intimidated to talk. He encourages healthy discussions. He is one of the best professors Rutgers has.,1
"I took him for a CIT 170 class and he was insanely amazing. I am generally a bit slower in school so an online class was very confusing for me, well for the START. I met with him twice and he really did help clarify it with TONS of patients. He literally sat there with me while we did one of my tutorials for over an hour. Take him if you can!",1
"Gives helpful feedback on assignments. Very patient and positive attitude towards students. Main drawback to this class was the massive amount of reading, especially workshopping up to 19 other students in the class, 3 times over the semester, giving detailed feedback on each piece. Added to the time spent on your own work, it takes several hours.",1
"I don't recommend this teacher to anyone,  and most of the readings and assignments didn't pertain to English.  She grades harshly on essays and doesn't except late work.",0
"This is like a whole other bio class. We have 4 exams worth 50pts each when the labs are only 8pts. There is also an essay that's mandatory for her class. She grades extremely tough. There are also assigned animals for the semester that she uses for every test, which is tough and all free responses. She is horrible and grades based on how she feels",0
Tough grader. Rude. Stubborn.,0
"He focuses on the text book for everything. Doesn't like to be wrong, he's always right because ""he's a professional"". I thought I was doing great and expected a b+ ended up with a C!!!!! he sure is a tough grader. Expects for you to be working on his class all the time.",0
"Dr. Wilson has a poor knowledge of the information in the course. She often asks the class questions that she does not know the answer to herself. I do not recommend her as a professor. I would rather skip her classes and read the book myself. She swears by her lecture notes but they are useless, and do not correlate to info on the tests.",0
Very nice professor! Helpful and understanding.,1
He is one of the worst professors you can imagine. Talks more about politics than physics. Stay away from this professor if you are actually looking to learn.,0
"Allen is enthusiastic and the class is pretty good overall. Definitely not a complete ""easy A"" and requires some studying, but easier than most Berkeley classes. 2 hours of lecture and no discussion for 3 units makes up for the annoying field trips.",1
"Dr. Day is the WORST professor I've had so far! If you skip lecture, you are guarunteed to loose points because attendance and pop quizzes count toward your grade. Also, he teaches as if everyone has a strong background in coding (despite being an INTRO class). If you don't have experience coding, you will most likely struggle in labs.",0
She is amazing! Not many student know about her but I highly recommend her as a chem teacher. She is the type of teacher who would lets you use notes on quizzes but not exams. lectures can get kinda boring but try and pay attention because the examples do help you out on the quiz. She is funny. She makes things so easy for you to understand.,1
The best CBE teacher I've ever had. Do HW and practice exams that he posts and you should be fine.,1
"Not a hard class. Had lectures, occasional pop-quizzes on chapter readings, 4 speeches, a midterm where you evaluated a speech, and one speech about a concept in the book. Do all of the work and you will easily pass. Not the best professor I've ever had but he's a very nice guy and this class is very doable.",1
Excellent teacher. Very supportive and helpful. Wish all were like her.,1
She doesnt actually teach. She just talks about her personal life. Regularly late for class. Very unclear with grading.,0
Can I give you some advice? Don't take a class with this prof if you can avoid it. Trust me on this one.,0
Mrs. Wedemeyer is a very good instructor.  She has a lot of material to cover but also wants to make sure everyone understands before moving to something new.  She also welcomes students to come ask questions during her office hours.  I would recommend her to anyone needing accounting.,1
"You should engage in the class discussions!  It will help you understand the material better.  McKenzie likes students that are willing to speak up and converse.  Class is entertaining, especially this past semester.   Read the books, participate, show up for the quizzes and tests and take your group project seriously and you are gold!",1
This class is not an easy 'A'. The work load is excessive. I believe she is posting her own reviews on this site.,0
"Isabelle seemed really nice and she was probably nervous as she told us it was her first time lecturing for such a large class but man..... she basically just read off the slide, all her own statements were just reworded what she had just said, and she was extremely confusing. There was stuff on the exam we NEVER covered. Goin to class not worth it",0
"Dr. J was an awesome teacher in my first semester. Funny, engaging, and knowledgeable. He always made sure to be clear and always asked if he needed to clarify. Always helpful when you needed extra help and never felt like I was bothering him. Will likely take him again.",1
"I was one of the last two taking the final exam, when he walked to his TA and started talking about how easy the test was and how bad everyone was doing. Yes, while students are still taking it... Try concentrating while being made to feel stupid by someone who is suppose to be professional. Long story short I didn't do well and went from C to D.",0
"Dr. Smith does assign a lot of homework, so if you dont want that in your life, pass. But, the homework was for the most part incredibly easy and took about 10 minutes every time. Her lectures are great and she likes to have the class talk in her lecture. She has exit slips every day, so be sure to show up!",1
Great Teacher Always willing to help out.,1
She's not even qualified to teach college courses.  She told our class that she only has a Masters degree in Education - not even in Biology.... Goodwin should give her the pink slip..,0
really boring.... no will to come to class,0
"Attendance is not mandatory - as he podcasts everything. The class is graded on one midterm (30% of your grade) and one final (70% of your grade). Both are in class assignments, short essay form, where you answer questions based on hypothetical laws or legal arguments. They are open book and open note (no electronics though).",1
Needs to repent...very creepy..lots of perversity going on there,0
"Worst class I ever took in college. PLEASE FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO TAKE. This class is a waste of time and money. She has no reviews, the practice quizzes have nothing to do with the real quizzes, and she deducts points off your labs for no reason.",0
"Dr. Wooten is an amazing teacher and 315 was a great course but there is a LOT of work required. Expect to write over 3000 words, read several chapters, and complete a project every week. On the bright side, there are no exams.",1
"Prof. Draper is one of the most supportive, flexible instructors that I've had at this school. She goes above and beyond to help students and teaches with such clarity and genuine empathy. This pandemic has been stressful for a lot of us; having an instructor as fair and caring as Dr. Draper makes this all so much easier. Highly recommend.",1
"He is a very hard professor.  He does have favorites, but he does not punish those who are not his faves.  His tests are ridiculously hard, but he does it to make you think through what you learned. IF you are up for a challenge and really want to learn something- he is the prof for you!",0
Not the best professor to take. There are a lot of questions on the exams for a short period of time. She gives a lot of readings. The study guides are no help. She's a tough grader.,0
Reisinger is the best French prof I've ever had. She's a hard grader but is always willing to help and tries to make class interesting. She gets to know her students and is friendly.,1
Doesnt explain things to where everyone can understand. Expects everyone to learn the same. Makes you feel like youre stupid if you dont understand something.,0
no.,0
She skims over explaining how to actually do things and just expects you to understand. Assigns lots of online homework in bulk but you have a week usually to do the 15-40 problems. Test vary in difficulty and the final is under 30 questions but adds up to 200 points and 20% of your grade and she takes points away for every little mistake...,0
"She is a nice teacher and tries to be helpful. She is a very fair grader, I would take another class with her again.",1
"Dr. SASS is amazing. Her class is easy as long as you do the readings. She doesn't do exams but has in class (open note) short essays and does oral quizzes. The quizzes aren't hard. She'll call on you for an answer, which come right out of the book, and she never tries to trick you with questions. Jokes around in class Absolutely loved her.",1
Very picky when grading!,0
"Erika's class is ridiculously easy, but beyond boring. I love anthropology, but this class made me want to sleep. I sat on my phone during every class and ended up with an A. Erika also is strict on her grading in weird ways, like turning in assignments. I was NOT a fan of her as a professor. She just talks and talks and talks until you sleep.",0
"i took accounting in high school so the course is easy and understandable, but if i hadnt taken accounting prior, i would be so confused",0
Super prof très interressant!!,1
"He has a great personality, hes hilarious. But when it comes down to teaching, he just isnt good at it. It felt like I had to teach myself, he goes too fast in lectures and really isnt clear on things. Dont bother emailing him because he takes too long to answer them.",0
She doesn't make it easy to approach her or ask questions. Condescending remarks are in every lecture. She keeps you the whole class time and rambles. There is no acknowledgement for effort. I'm considering dropping this class which would stop me from graduating this semester. I'm a 3.8 GPA student and have never failed a test until now.,0
"Worst professor/class experience I have had at UCSC thus far. Unnecessarily mean and an absolute B. Horrendous experience, wouldn't recommend her to anyone. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES. Takes her frustrations out on her students and not one person I've talked to who has had her had anything good to say. Pretty much a 100%  ""hated it"" consensus.",0
Exams are very difficult. Very hard grader. Not very understanding.,0
He is a sweet heart the exams are just like the homework,1
It was an easy one credit class show up on time. Ask question participate if you can. She is VERY nice and tells stories that will make you laugh and think.Hand in the finial paper and you will get an A like I did.,1
Its an online class so u are on ur own. Textbook is a must and u have to teach urself by reading it. The material is hard to learn on ur own. Weekly homework assignments are hard and discussion board is a lot to do at the last day since u need to write an essay for full credit. But in class review classes make ur mind blown. Dont take eco online,1
So attendance is not necessary all the powerpoints are online but she does take into consideration your attendance and participation. If you were smart you would come to class she has a very clear way of explaining what the powerpoints are about. Each of her exams and quizzes have opportunity to gain extra points. She makes psych interesting!!!!!!,1
"His tests & quizzes are straight from class notes, don't waste your money on a text book. He is very passionate about Economics which makes the course interesting. He is hard to get a hold of and barely checks his email, but he is an amazing professor!",1
Expects perfection,0
"Good teacher. Easy class with an extremely light workload. 2 tests and a final. Final is the most difficult but 50 multiple choice questions and a notecard. Never went the full class time, if you do your work on time and use a flash card on the tests you will get an A.",1
"Believe only the bad reviews, impossible to get an A, no makeup under any circumstances, narrow grading scale, doesn't give full points only partial and fractioned points ie 3.25 pts out of 5, focuses on irrelevant items on exams, lectures are weighted more than quizzes and exams. Shall I go on...? Avoid taking, will ruin GPA. Unhappiness :(",0
"Dan is absolutely amazing. He is very thorough in class with his lectures, and you can tell he truly wants everyone to be successful in his class. Doing the homework is a good idea because most of his problems on tests/quizzes are very similar to the ones he gives for homework. If you show up and participate in class he'll love you.",1
"Dewey's not the best COMS teacher. He doesn't answer emails at a timely matter. He also doesn't post grades on blackboard. He evaluates every speech but never passes back what you got so you can't really improve on anything since you don't know where to improve. Also, he did say that there will be reading quizzes but won't tell you when they are.",0
"Do not take this class if you want to learn something. Ms. Bouchard is interesting to look at, but she is not good at teaching. She is unorganized, does not follow the syllabus, makes up assignments as she goes along and does not grade anything until the end of the term. Her lectures are about the definitions and no real legal research happening. ",0
Susan is SO AMAZING. She is to date the best professor I've ever had. I still go to her for advice. Going to her office hours is a great experience and she will remember things like that! She knows so much about pre-production and makes you want to come to each and every class. LOVE HER!,1
"Dr. Carr (he received his doctorate in Fall 2020) is truly a leader of future leaders. His class is helpful on so many levels and can assist anyone. He makes you read for sure and there are many assignments to help reflect on yourself. He requires a lot and sets high expectations, but it only serves to help you. Dr. Carr is inspirational.",1
"I have loved History my entire life. Taking this class made me doubt that love on multiple occasions. There is way too much reading for a gen ed. I had to spend more time on this class than I did on the rest, lowering my overall grade. He also seems to think we're all below average students. And I'm pretty sure History is more than Social Mobility.",0
I am also a student at ASU and i decided to take this class at AWC since it is on zoom and cheaper than if i took it at ASU. Prof Gier is alot better at teaching economics than the other economics professor I had at ASU. i definitely recommend.,1
"This professor is the worst!! She is rude and mean. She does not care to help students, Laughs at us when we ask questions. She is writes rude emails and is rude when you go to her office hours for help. Despite her being hard to understand and confusing, she is not nice at all.",0
Do not take if you're not great in Math,0
"Do not take this class. 40+ pages to read, 3 tests, 3 quizzes, a 30 minute video and discussion board EVERY WEEK. This was the hardest class I have ever taken and it doesn't get easier. He's a nice guy, but a harsh grader. I am a strong writer and managed a borderline A in the class. This is a GPA killer unless you are dedicated!",0
"She took a whole month before posting grades, she makes smart/offensive remarks when answering questions, grades every quiz differently (can have the same answers as others, Some will get it correct while others get them wrong) and gets mad when students point out her mistakes.",0
"Great professor. Cares about students and will help with assignments, and she encourages discussions. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. Don't take if you just want an easy A and not much work, but do take if you like philosophy and thinking outside the box.",1
Worst teacher I have ever experienced. Elementary Spanish 1 became level 3 Spanish her  tests are over 100 questions. She doesn't respond to emails. I explained to her how during one of the online exams that my computer crashed and emailed her right away but not response. Went to talk to her about it and she said there was nothing I can do. BS,0
"She was the sweetest professor, thanks to her I discovered my love for Sociology and Social work. Her class isnt tough the PowerPoints and self explanatory and so are her reviews I really enjoyed her class. I was a Sociology major, which is why I was interested in taking this course. Her class is an easy A if you just show up and pay attention.",1
"Madhu has specific unspoken criteria for assignments, even when you follow the syllabus she always finds ways to deduct points. Unlike other ECE profs, she does not accept missing assignments at the end of the semester, and you will get a zero for them. If you are having hardships in your personal life she isn't super compassionate or accommodating",0
"Doesn't like to absorb new viewpoints. Takes three weeks to grade one paper. Spends most of the class talking about how many poetry degrees he has and how much he knows, rather than talking to his students about the material. Wouldn't take a class from him again.",0
"VERY RUDE, Does not speak clear (very heavy Russian accent). She always follows her OLD EDITION book. Book is EXPENSIVE!!!",0
"Very knowledgable, enthusiastic and current.  Obviously works hard preparing the lectures and demonstrates interest in her students work.",1
Karen is a completely disrespectful and discriminating teacher towards 1st generation students who work full-time. Ive dropped from an 88/100 to a 69.9 in one mistakenly missed 30 point assignment and wont get the courtesy of a 0.10 grade round up. I'll fight tooth and nail for this 0.10. Believe me.,0
"would take her again. she is a tough grader, extremely specific about apa. but she is clear in what she is looking for. her test questions are specific, but i guess technically they are fair overall. she gives all the info you need in the slides and when she talks you really need to listen. and she is super nice",1
"OMG..class isn't hard, test aren't difficult IF you go to class, take notes and read lectures. No, he doesn't spoon feed you material for test, but it's all in front of you. REALLY? You have zero HW, read some, ONLY 3 exams with 25 MC questions and the course is DIFFICULT? Professor IS Hysterical and genuinely interested in the material. TAKE HIM!",1
"ALL THE TESTS are based on the models available in the lab, but he doesn't use the models to teach, ASK HIM to explain the models & take pictures to practice on your own. Tests are fair & straightforward. Read & do the homework, use review sheets to study. He doesn't use blackboard or power points, lectures are boring, not helpful in my opinion.",0
She is the best! Take her class and you will not regret it!,1
"I took this class in preparation for my CGBP exams. Introduction to Exports is naturally a tough class, so i was happy to make a B.  Professor Chii is a nice lady, she really did her best to help.",1
"Literally one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. Adviser for ECE degrees. Very experienced, down to earth and helpful. Great online class, loved the field  placement I was in (got hired there, partly because she is well-known in the early childhood community here and her good reference helps) and yeah, really a great person.",1
I've taken Mrs. Dodson for several math classes.  This review is based on her statistics class which I feared going into.  She is very helpful and explains things in a manner that's easier to understand than most textbooks.  She's also easy to work with.,1
You can tell that she really cares for her students. She spends some time going over the material in class much not as much as she showed. The tests are kind of hard especially if you don't study.,1
"Good class. You have to write a lot, and re-write, but if you do this you shoul dbe okay.",1
"Patti is one of my favorite teachers here. She's kind, helpful and very understanding. It's so easy to talk to her and I have had no problem asking for extensions on assignments. I would definitely take one of her classes again and recommend you take her class.",1
"Dave Boden is great! He is a great teacher and his power points are very lucid. If you just go to class, take notes, pay attention, you will pass this class. Dave explains  the material so well, and he is always there for help. This was definitely one of my easiest class, but he loves when you are very very very very descriptive in all the labs.",1
"This professor is very condescending. Random pop quizzes, so beware! He speeds through lectures and doesn't really teach, so prepare to learn the material on your own. I do not recommend his lecture or his lab.",0
Michelle ROCKS!!! one of my best profs at SU. Always ready to help.,1
"I had Dr. Phelps for two art history classes. He was hard but fair. The people that complained about him never came to class or texted and slept.  So as long as you came, paid attention and took good notes you did well. In the first class the students where uninterested but in my second class the students where engaged and it made for a fun time.",1
"Dr. Lim was not the best professor for this class. Avoid him like the plague if you can. I got a 67% on the final and that was the average. There was no curve in the class whatsoever, the only reason I passed was because the TA was amazing and gave a lot of partial credit. Multiple people cried during his final.",0
BEWARE!!! He is a horrible online teacher. I DO NOT recommend taking him at all. He doesnt respond to emails whatsoever. I went to meet with him about my grades because projects that I turned in months ago still hadnt been graded. He didnt know that he hadnt make the final available to us until I met with him that day..,0
Dr. Carter is a fantastic professor and is very passionate about anthropology. He is easy to talk to and super willing to help. 10/10 recommend taking his class.,1
"I took the computer deal of his class, where you do the course online but you're in a class with him. I liked the program and his teaching style is nice, you raise your hand, ask your question and you get a PERFECT answer, and I SUCK at math, I mean with a capital S. He's very mellow, chill, and funny at times.",1
"Miss Dee is the best. I hated speech communication but since I met her, I realize how speech is very interesting. Not because of what it is but the way this professor delivers and her way of teaching. I never got bored not left alone. She really helps when you need help and easy to communicate with. I recommend her fully !!",1
"As an English teacher, her English really sucks.",0
"While Sra. Graetzer is a lovely person, her class is completely unorganized and she does not give clear directions for class assignments. Her class has not followed any kind of syllabus, and there were little-to-no clear instructions as to how anything in her class was going to follow. Kind lady, not a great professor.",0
"If you take intro or her gender and sex class, then you will have a blast. But if you take any higher level courses with her be prepared. She never actually teaches the material, it is up to you to learn it. Basically I learn more from the books she assigns than her in my other classes.",0
"The work itself isn't difficult, but he makes you take quizzes before the lecture is available to make sure you have read. It makes it difficult since the book doesn't explain well. The amount of work is crazy and it's difficult to keep up if you're fulltime. You can pass but if you have the option avoid him.",0
"he can be rude and if you don't understand something and ask a question, he often makes it more confusing for you. he randomly leaves the classroom (daily, MULTIPLE times per class period). the labs make no sense unless you've already taken classes before. he makes it way harder to understand then he should for a gen ed course.",0
"Prof. Steven's is one of the best organized teachers in the math department. She doesn't cut corners and is VERY caring. She doesn't dumb down the curriculum like other instructors but provides an extremely well coordinated online class. If you put your hours in you will learn and get a good grade, period. Best way to do Calc 1.",1
"Avoid if possible. Although he's a nice guy and very funny, I found the lectures to be very unclear. I had to teach myself everything in this class and mechanics is not an easy thing to self teach. Studying hard and often is the key to doing well. He gives a quiz every class but helps in the end. Tests are hard but he curves the average to a 75.",0
"She is one of the most wonderful professors or human being I have ever met. She is hilarious+ a great lecturer and teaches you not only what's in the textbook but also teaches you what's outside the textbook, a real-life lesson. She really cares about students. If you reach out to her for help she would make herself available for you.",1
Great Professor with a wonderful personality.  If you ask a question about advertising you know he is well versed in the category and is more than willing to answer questions.,1
Had him for First Year Seminar. Really nice guy and tries to help you as much as he can. Would take for another class if I could.,1
"Not super difficult. We had 3 papers with criteria that were extremely clear. He is not a difficult grader, but make sure you show up to lectures because his papers are based on what he says. Textbook readings were all online and relevant to the class. He is pretty funny and lectures always went by fast",1
"Very helpful with feedback. You do need to stay on top of the work for it to be a easy class,  but if you do you will pass. You also get out what you out in. Very understanding of outside issues if you must be late on an assignment.  Not a standard teacher with just standing there lecturing. Class participation is  vital",1
"Seeing other reviews that this professor is mean/rude; VERY TRUE! First time dealing with a prof like him, & its very disappointing. Guy sure does love the course & the course is loaded w work, but couldnt care less if you swim or sink. ENC1101 was a breeze for me, this class & teacher was just a nightmare.",0
"Started on Ch. 9 on the first day in a difficult subject for first-level math (complicated statistics). No intro, nothing. Horrible, said on first day she didn't care if we ever got sick and to not ""bother"" her with emails. Withdrew within the second week. Waste of time",0
"Professor Ven is very informative, has good lectures, and is sympathetic with her students. The midterm can be well studied from the lectures notes and homework. The homeworks take anywhere from 1-3 hours depending on your prior knowledge of the material. Class is similar to ICS 53. One coding project at the 2nd half of the class.",1
"Best teacher I had at ISU. Challenging, but fair. He was a great teacher in the History programs I took during my History Ed studies. He's funny and took us out for drinks after we finished capstone works and semesters.",1
He's is very understanding if you can't make class for a valid reason. He is very nice and super helpful! Very easy to approach and ask questions and if you don't have certain supplies he is always there to help you out with extra stuff.,1
The workload for this class was way too much. Many late nights were spent working on this class when I shouldve been focused on classes related to my major. Attendance is a must. Shes a very harsh grader. Be prepared to spend 1/2 the class talking about BS. After wasting class time she will throw in assignments at the end. Class never ends early.,0
"Good prof who knows her material and seems to teach thoroughly enough. Be sure to go to EVERY class and do EVERY reading; the exams are dependent on the readings much more than the lectures. Be sure to hand the paper in ON TIME because she doesn't accept anything at all past the due date, right down to the minute (i.e. don't make my mistakes).",1
"Literally worst professor I've ever had. She is rude to students, doesn't helped when needed and her tests are ridiculously hard. Especially for a class that is required for a lot of majors. Never take her.",0
"Dr. Feagin grades incredibly hard for no reason. Like it's history class? Relax. She doesn't give a rubic for her ""activities"" or assignments, but takes pts off for my bibliography not being in abc order???? If I would have known, I would have put my sources in abc order. Nevertheless, do not take her class if you're looking for a easy hist class",0
"If you struggle with math, don't take her. She isn't helpful and makes it even more difficult. Can be condescending and treats students like children. The book is something that she and other instructor put together. There isn't much there to help you learn material. Strong accent and difficult to understand.",0
"He is a very ""pro"" and nice professor. He knows the material very well. But he is a little lacking on explanation. A few of the material he covered are a little unclear. May be I suck at it. His assignments are hard and it gets you to think. He really challenges you to think about CS deeply. His exams are pretty challenging.",1
"He gives quizzes every week worth only 1% of your mark that let you know your weak areas. If you spend time only studying the material for the quizzes where you didn't score 100%, you'll ace this class. He doesn't care about attendanceparticipation.",1
"Bulgarian. Likes to quote Madonna. Has an app on his phone that lets him take care of kittens and sometimes you hear his phone meow. Cool dude, easy class.",1
"Super strict about guidelines, but yet confusing. The exams are headache inducing. The material itself was really interesting but she did not seem to care about the students, even if it was an online class. And the final paper had nothing to do with the material covered in class.",0
"He knows his math, but can't teach students. Most of the time it seemed liked he wasn't even aware that he was teaching a class. He just went up to the board and did math. He pretty much tells you what is going to be on the exams, and he drops the lowest exam. If you already know calcus, he is fine, but I wouldn't take him if I didn't know calculus",0
"You will not pass the tests if you skip class or don't have a friend that takes good notes to borrow from. Crash Course videos are good for rounding out understanding of the ancient philosophers near beginning of the course. DO THE READINGS, at least skimming and/or annotating. Go to the breakouts and ace the weekly quiz or it will sink your grade.",1
"Nice dude, but you dont learn anything in his classes!",0
"Dr. Mark grades you off of her personal feelings and will not clarify when you ask for reasonings as to why your grade is so low. She is a very boring lecturer and does not respect students when grades are late or if there's a family emergency. She also grades your participation on how she feels you did in class, her personal opinion of you.",0
"Interesting lectures, keeps you engaged, nice teacher. Along with this class is a clinical experience which takes up a lot of time, but he is very clear with expectations. No way to get around it, I'd take him again if I had to.",1
"Very cool guy, a little odd but in a good way! Like's to start class with some music. Very funny and honest. He will make you do some work, but not to much. Great professor all around.",1
"Worse 101 to take @ NYIT. Do not take this professor, she gives at least 4 pages of notes per class. Makes you write essays from a book with garbage. Her mid term and final are stupid, you won't learn anything here. You be better off in a English class than her trash class. Oh yeah btw she has a project which is stupid along with final so GL.",0
She is an easy professor with a thick accent. Runs through the powerpoints quickly and her test are timed online. Strict on attendance. Had to drop this professor because she would not let me miss class for a family matter. Was very rude to me and hard to contact her through email.,0
"I took Mrs. Wedemeyer for a mini-mester and let me tell you, it was tough. She knows her subject and is great at it. Be respectful and don't get frustrated when you ask questions and she seems to be rude. She wants to challenge you and means no harm. Probably one of the best teachers i've ever had. Be ready to do some work in this class.",1
"Horrible. Worst teacher ive ever taken. She grades WAY too hard, and is not good at teaching at all. If you miss any work, you cant make up for it. She is too strict, and slow. Would never take again. Terrible",0
"I loved this course, But prof is  not easy. He takes points off. But the good part is that if you do good on final exam, he will grade you according to that.Irrespective of what you got in class pop quizzes.",0
"Professor D'Sa is understanding of his students and is willing to help if you ask for it.  Lectures just breeze by, and tests are sorta easy.  Yes there are pop quizzes, but he basically announces when they'll be and what they're about.  Tips: Understand the homework rather than just doing it; study in groups; and review your exam with him.  ",1
"Taken during COVID, she's too unaccustomed to online learning. Assignments were graded harshly, we got 0 feedback, and we didn't finish all the syllabus assignments due to her negligence. Had very little sympathy for students, answered questions with annoyed sighs and insults. Learned mostly through Pearson study modules & the textbook.",0
"Bridges is really one of the nicest people that you won't forget, she's hilarious, caring, and really encouraging! however, she does get off topic a lot of times, and she messes up arithmetics a lot, which makes her a tough grader b/c a simple careless mistake of yours that messes up the whole problem will get you 8 points deducted out of 9",1
You have to work for an A but Dave provides you with everything you need. He is incredibly helpful and makes learning financial accounting fun. ,1
He'll provide more info on tests and topics if you ask. Knows his stuff and the in class discussions are enjoyable. Do the homework and study well. Some extra credit opportunities on tests.,1
I took her class online and she took forever to get back to me for any question. The tests are unnecessarily difficult and so much information was poured down our throats for no reason because a lot of the information was not on the test. Would never take again.,0
"Intro to programming and problem solving. Midterm: 30% and final: 35%. Probably the toughest class to take. Assignments 20% but there's no help. There's no tutorial or anything, and book doesn't help. He expects you to figure out java coding by yourself. Lets just say if you have no idea about programming then you will fail.",0
"She's interesting. We basically sit in a circle and talk about poems and stories the entire class. grade is based on midterm and final only so if you miss a class, you don't miss anything. it was definitely boring at times but I got an A so I'm happy. She's really really sweet and super easy going about everything. i would definitely recommend her",1
"Dr. Harris is a very good professor. He cares about his students a lot and is very nice and encouraging. He is more than willing to help, if you ask for it. I had him for Ear Training I. The class is fairly easy as long as you practiced.",1
"She takes forever to grade things. It took her a month to grade simple quizzes to test. She waits until the semester is up to grade. She does not give extra credit, and does not help you when you mess up. She does not care if you fail. I never had a teacher like her. She is a tough grader on her papers. Takes forever to get a reply back. ",0
"Mr. Brooks was not my favorite, he was very monotoned so when you are in class it is very hard to stay focused. When working from home/online he is very short and not helpful in the slightest. Once working from home he would assign tests but not announce to you that you had an assignment. they were hidden in folders and not made known to students.",0
No Comments,1
GREATEST CLASS EVER! If I could take his for every class I would. He is simply a fantastic teacher. He kind of reminds you of your grandfather that you star gaze with. Fantastic professor!,1
"This class is not an easy A by any means. Your grade is determined by 4 tests and 13 quizzes so there is little margin for error. Professor Burdine reads off powerpoint slides the entire class which can get dull, and the problems that are used to practice for the test rarely contain the actual answers. Very average, but not great.",1
"I couldn't believe it, but somehow Tax Accounting was my favorite class. Way to go, Dr. Smith. I took the class online and as long as you watch the lectures and do the reading you will do fine.",1
"I've never had a more BORING instructor, let alone subject.  For an online student there's next to no interaction and reply and grading times are horrible.",0
Professor Mukherjee is very arrogant and condescending in his class. He assumes you know everything and will take as much time ridiculing the students than he could just be explaining. Super test heavy and a quiz every week. By far the worst professor I've ever had.,0
"I came to this class with some understanding of statistics.  I'm leaving wondering what the heck he was talking about.  As has been said, he teaches from the slides, which usually don't make much sense.  His lectures simply aren't clear and he doesn't seem to care.",0
"i just ended my semester in her class. Let me begin by telling you, biggest mistake i made in college so far. I knew i should have dropped with a W when i had the chance to. But i believed she would see my effort and perseverance but no, it didn't matter. First day is 40 people, ends with about 12 people. Final group project, everyone got a D or F!",0
very strong accent. very hard to understand.  I didn't learn anything in this class.  He teaches stuff that should be common sense to most people.  If you know  how to use a computer this class should be easy for you.  He gives out multiple choice tests which arent too bad.  pretty boring lectures.   Veryyy easy to pass class just do all the work!,0
"Think twice before you decide to take this class during summer. Cannot remember when was the last time that I met a professor who would disrespect students in front of the whole class to comfort his anger. Extremely harsh grader, pray for B before getting any of your work back. A condescending professor, not a qualified educator.",0
"Have her for Psy 271. she is flipping the classroom this semester so we play games every time. not helpful at all. refuses to answer questions in class. tests are hard and very confusing. 50 question hw assignment every week, same thing every week.",0
"Maureen occasionally just won't show up to class, because  she over slept or wasn't feeling well. She is also often late. She took over a month to mark our first essays , giving us only less than a week to write and second and third final essay. She failed over half the class on the first essay. Her weekly quizzes are almost impossible & take 2hrs",0
"She is fun, weird, and helpful. Pretty easy class, also buys some materials for students.",1
Prof Shine is a very nice and kind man. He does tend to get off topic easily but he is very sweet and cares about his students and the content he teaches. I got him a gift because I liked having him so much and he bought me a book in return. I would highly recommend him. Especially for being able to redo the midterm till the final is due.,1
"Makes me feel so dumb. Yells at kids for not asking questions, then when someone does ask he says I just went over that or makes it seem like the answer is so easy. Basically no homework, just tests and quizzes, and the final is only 12% of our grades. Not accessible and always finds a way to be passive aggressive.",0
"He's a nice guy and gives no graded homework, just readings. His tests are tough. You have to take notes on the lectures but also about the reading discussions. He gives a super detailed study guide for every test so if you take good notes and apply them to the guide, you'll be fine. If you miss class then you'll miss a lot of information.",1
Totally awesome. In 2 weeks I was honestly speaking in Japanese.  Prof Garrisi starts speaking in Japanese the first day of class. Awesome Awesome! She takes attendance for every class. You want to be there. Daily homework from the workbook. Quizzes and test super easy as long as you attend review classes and study. TAKE HER YOU WONT REGRET IT.,1
"Dennis can make u laugh, but is a very good teacher. After having numberous classes w/ he was very helpful",1
"I have never had such a terrible professor in my entire college career. I submitted every paper, took every exam, and only missed about 3 classes and I still failed the course. I went to her before every one of my papers were due, for help, and still failed every paper. If you do not agree with her personal beliefs she will fail you!!",0
"Dr. Hoffman is such as nice, eccentric professor. He clearly loves teaching, and his lectures break down complex topics into clear, manageable chunks. He is very helpful during office hours after class. His course was one of the best courses I have ever taken.",1
Dr. vohs is more focused on getting through the class rather then making sure we no the material. If you try to get help from him in his office he  seems rushed and annoyed. Take this class if you already know everything there is to know about chemistry because he isn't going to teach you anything,0
"Roxi was ALWAYS late to class. She grades you based on 5 essays and 25% participation. If you aren't her favorite, she is very rude and intimidating. Lots of reading and papers.",0
dont be fooled by Elementary Spanish this class is tough and if you are not comfortable with the language do take it. im fluent in Spanish and there were some questions that I struggled to answer. the professor seems nice but completely disappeared throughout the 10 week course. she DOES NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL. avoid at all cost. no support at all,0
"I took the class before knowing her, but ended up liking her. She is a very clear regarding assignments, paper, presentations. Mid term and final terms were easy. Participation in class matters.",1
"Either he doesn't care or he doesn't understand English enough to answer questions, so have fun teaching yourself. His ""lectures"" are just reading from the slides word for word. All the stuff he draws on the board is, you guessed it, straight from the slides. If he says something you don't understand, don't ask questions. He'll just repeat himself.",0
"I had Professor Bushey for CHEM131 and he was fine, however having him for 132 was hell. He is not good at explaining material, and often moves wayyy too fast. He got some of his own answers wrong and made the learning catalytics very stressful and due at the very beginning of class, but would get you the code minutes before. Not taking him again.",0
Professor Ruiz was nice but I felt as though the setup of her online course was a bit confusing and there were conflicting dates on there. She responds to emails and is helpful and always offering for you to go to her office if you have issues or questions.,1
"He is extremely passionate about what he is teaching, which makes you more excited to be there. Sometimes hard to follow, due to amount of material covered in each class. Assigns LOTS of readings each night, but do the readings! Things will make more sense in class and he gives pop quizzes.",1
"I've taken two courses taught by Dr. Coutinho (one online and one in the classroom) and I thoroughly enjoyed them both! Father Coutinho's classes are really interesting, as he shares his knowledge and life experiences. I learned not only about the subject matter, but also a lot about myself.",1
"He is really nice, but not the best professor.  He is very unorganized and doesn't really ""teach"".  He assigns HW  then just expects you to know the material for next class.  You have no idea what to expect on his tests (he won't even tell you the form of it, ex. writing section? vocab section? multiple choice?)  Overall- nice guy, bad professor.",0
Professor knows her subject. Tests are HARD! Gives opportunities for extra credit - take them because you're going to need it. Do all homework.,0
Has a hard time speaking. only information is pre made slides. recommend not taking him.,0
"Professor Washburn is an excellent instructor, having a broad base of both theoretical and practical knowledge. The class content was a great balance of individual and group work. The class culture was based on mutual respect and participation was highly encouraged. The class materials were great, excellent textbook and video, while dated, valuable",1
"Professor Hill isn't the best teacher, her class is pretty boring, but her tests are almost all of the clicker questions from class and the online quizzes. If you study and come to class, you will do fine in the course.",0
"I loved this class!!! It was amazing. The quizzes were sort of hard depending on how well I read and the tests were standard, just do the reading. His lectures helped me understand what I read. Hes very kind, helped me when I couldnt take a quiz on time. Sincerely cares about ones grade. Open minded. Beware anyone who is too lazy to read.",1
"He has some good lecture notes, and this is the only good thing about him. If you think you can learn Matlab, latex, or maple with a book by yourself, don't take the class. If you need someone to teach you, find someone else.",0
"This guy is the man! I've had him for a few classes already, and plan to have him for some more. He lectures a lot, but is willing to stop and explain everytime a hand is raised. Likes to show hollywood movies to get the point of his class across. Great teacher! Highly recommend taking all of his classes!",1
Definitely one of the best professors I have ever had. The lectures and classwork are super easy. She provides guided notes which are really helpful for the exams and quizzes. All the information you need is on the guided notes. Currently taking 6 classes and this one is my favorite by far !!!,1
"She is tough, but very organized and thorough. She returns papers within a week, sometimes less. She is very picky about punctuation, capitalization, and shows you how to improve your work. Does not accept late assignments.",1
Loved this teacher. Would definitely take again. Super nice and knowledgeable. Definitely a teacher who cares about her students and their success.,1
"Wonderful professor. Intermediate II is a tough class, but he does a great job of breaking down the material in a way that is easier to understand. His tests are really fair and he gives partial credit. High recommend!",1
One of the better teachers I have had yet. She goes over problems in great detail and will personally help you if you go to her. She wants to see everyone understand why things happen and not just getting the answer.,1
Time flies with Mr. Carter! It doesn't even feel like you're taking a speech class because he makes it so relaxing and like it's no big deal to speak in public. Easy speeches and easy class.  Would take another class from him if I could.,1
"first midterm was the exact same questions as the study guide. second midterm was nothing like the study guide. midterms were 2 questions. very generous curve. the final was really just another midterm, and really easy. much easier of a class than i anticipated.",1
"A little boring and her lectures are hard to follow at times, but she's nice. If you need to, just ask her to slow down and she will. Take good notes and study them before the tests and you'll do fine. I didn't get the textbook and the class was pretty easy. I liked that she didn't spend overly much time on wars, and taught other things too.",1
Awful professor. His lectures make no sense and he is always off topic. Do not take this class if you can help it.,0
"Dr. Vohs gives great notes, like a high school teacher.  However, he is hard to reach and offers little help outside of class.",0
"Sp 20 Honestly speaks in Spanish the whole time, youll be lost, and shes got a lot of attitude when she emails you. Stay clear",0
"Great Professor for Algorithms, in both teaching and research. Received lots of help from Piazza and lectures.",1
"This professor is one of the best teacher that I ever had, she's so lovely and caring about the students and she's willing to spend time with you if there's any doubts. She's really nice and will help no matter, she's passionate about mathematics and will not give up on you. She's an actual angel it's impossible to fail her class.",1
Alyssa is one of the best professors at CCNY. Her capacity of explaining texts material is extremely high. She is really cooperative and offers a lot of oppurtunities for students that you can take advantage of. She replies to emails in a blink of eyes with the best solution. It is totally a worth taking & enjoyable couse. Highly recommended.,1
"Beato is a nice guy but also never seems prepared for lectures. He is equally as surprised with what is on the next slide as you will be. Because of that, he gives off a chaotic vibe and often teaches out of order. That is not to say that he doesn't know the content, once he remembers what he wrote, he can normally explain it pretty well.",1
"Take her online if you can because it is a lot easier than in class. There is 1 quiz, 1 assignment, and 1 discussion for each unit. Quizzes are easy, assignments you have to write a lot of short responses, discussions you have to read and explain your thoughts. Study guide for every test. The more you write the higher your grade will be.",1
Wonderful Professor! She gives out all her contact information so she is super accessible and will respond even on nights and weekends. She has no patience for laziness but if you put one step forward she would walk a mile for you.,1

"One of the most unorganized professor I have ever experienced. Unclear answers when students ask questions. Assign homework, quizzes, and exams on materials we have not touched yet. Do not take this guy.",0
"Field trips for the Twin Cities History course were great; we got to hear from a lot of cool people. Classes were chock full of fascinating info. Lectures could run long, but were consistent with class length.  As for grading, there were only 3 paper assignments (writing intensive), and he was a fair grader. Would take another class with him!",1
"He Grades hard, Boring class",0
"DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS UNLESS YOU WANT SEVERAL MENTAL BREAKDOWNS!!! I BARELY passed. If you take this class you will be asking for 8 to 24 pages of notes every week, so beware of developing carpal tunnel! Also the mastering biology is HUNDREDS of questions.... the only good part of her class were the labs and those barely affect your grade..",0
He is a great lecturer and is passionate about his material.,1
"Genetics lab is  one of the toughest labs I have ever taken. However, I do not think that this is the TAs fault. She does her best to help out but you have to restrain from falling behind and outside sources along with office hours are necessary as the lab manual is very vague and the lab itself is on a very short and tight schedule.",1
"Prof. Ferrero's class was a delight. You can tell she's passionate about the subject as her class is designed for student success. Course has 4 exams based directly off her powerpoints, one project, and always fun activities at the end of class to help with curriculum comprehension. She also adds in interesting facts into her lectures, a real gem.",1
Amazing... she is just so great at what she does and shes very inspiring. Only thing you have to do is complete observation hours and youll be fine and be prepared to do exit & entrance slips but I promise its not long and boring.,1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH CAMP! If he is the only professor available, wait until next semester. He seems great and wonderful until after the last day of dropping the class before having to pay. On one writing I decided to try and be a good student and find the entire book of the section the reading came out of and he counted off, DONT TAKE HIM!!",0
She always gives so many homework questions and she takes them up as part of your points with your quiz grades. There are quizzes at the beginning of almost every class and she only gives 10 minutes for them. She takes off points for the SMALLEST & STUPIDEST things. She will be the reason you'll fail the class or drop out if you're not on top of it,0
do not take this class if possible,0
"She is hilarious! The class will keep you listening. there are quizzes everyday in class so you have go to class. I liked my TA. TALK!!! everything that is asked, reply to, it gets you points, especially if you dont go to class often. Only 1 exam in the class, 5 speeches, 5 essays, 1 big video project at the end.",1
"His tests are a cryptic mess. Over half of the questions are unclear and have little to no connection with what he covered in class. Same thing with his homework, all the questions are unrelated to his slides, which is what he reads for lectures, or the textbook. I feel like he taught what HE believes is good software engineering, which is garbage.",0
"Nice person, but not a good teacher. She is way scatter-brained but means well.",0
"I had her fall semester and she was very unclear but I thought it was the language barrier but it was not. I stood in her class till the end which was a huge mistake. She is very specific in what she wanted and you got no credit if you didn't follow her ""format"" (you just fold a paper a certain way) or not complete sentences. It's math..",0
"From my experience with Ken, people either love him or don't. He expects effort, and values you consulting him with your project before handing it in. He assigns a lot of work and sometimes it is  overwhelming, but he also asks for feedback about the size of the workloads and changes it up. He's a very decent guy who is good to have on your side.",1
This is the worst professor I ever had.  Does not answer questions.,0
"The discussion posts are impossible. He has instructions that you can use ANY Source; Text, Videos, OR Outside source. But when he comments back he says that if you use an outside source you have to use the textbook too which makes no sense. Directions are super unclear. He makes the work more difficult then it needs to be. DO NOT RECOMMEND",0
"Im taking this class now and I hate that she takes so long to grade your essays , you cant apply the feedback to your next paper! She grades the papers pretty tough too. Hard to maintain an A due to that . And she she doesnt have extra credit for you to try to make up for a bad paper. Id never take her again !",0
"One of my favorite professors by far here! He is so energetic, young and caring. He relates to everyone in the classroom and brings humanity into learning. He gives minimal work, and what he does give is so easy to finish. Not a tough grader but makes you think, which I loved. Take him if you get the chance you will not regret it!",1
"She never clarifies what exactly to study and the whole class is her ranting about her life. She's very outspoken and kind of funny at times, but she's bitter. She does NOT take any excuse for hw or test make-up, even if you were in the hospital or in a car accident, she DOESN'T CARE! would NOT EVER!Take her class again, i like my teachers to care.",0
one of the worst teachers at cape fear. hard to understand and is basically a self taught class. cannot teach a lick. unclear of assignments and embarrasses you if you ask a question,0
"This teacher can, and most likely will, drive you up a wall if you actually want to learn. He goes WAY off topic when lecturing (his stories are either funny, weird, or just annoying). His grading is fine and the essays are basic, time consuming assignments. It's simple to pass his class especially if you do his many extra credit assignments.",0
"She is extremely ignorant of special education  and grades as such. The strategy presentations are entirely Gen Ed and if you adapt for SPED, you get graded down.  Couldn't stand how fake she was.  I sat there entirely tuned out b/c she obviously didn't want to be there, nor did we.  Don't take her!",0
"Not a fan of this prof. He rips your papers apart, and gives you a ton of homework. All he does is lecture and laugh at his own jokes. Choose a different prof to fill your requirement.",0
"Jennifer Sias is a perfectly nice professor. She's understanding with deadlines and easy to understand. However, I found the class to be EXTREMELY disorganized. Lots of overwhelming assignments due at the same time, class time is often spent sitting in a circle and taking turns reading aloud. This was a bit frustrating, but the professor is nice.",1
"Fine at best. He is disgustingly arrogant. However, if you can get past his ego he is more concerned that you understand statistics overall opposed to just the math behind it, which is good. Some days he can be very boring. Tests are fair and papers (yes papers, quite a few of them) are not terrible at all. Overall not terrible but not enjoyable.",0
"Extremely unclear as to what he wanted from our papers, would routinely give out low grades without explaining why, in class reading assignments made no sense as they were all from Victorian England. In asking us to write a research paper he made it impossible to change our topic even if we wanted to early on. ",0
"Oh, I loved Mrs. Martin! She's funny is her own little cute way. She made sure you always understood the material. Very easy class. If you pay attention in her class you'd make all A's I would take her again!!",1
"Awesome teacher! She is very clear about what you need to know, and also gives extra credit to those who work hard and know the material.",1
"Has open book tests. One written assignment. Field trip to a jail. His class is very easy to pass.Can get a little boring sometimes but it was a 2 and a half hour class. He's pretty laid back, makes jokes every once in awhile. Worth taking",1
there are weekly labs that are a MUST. Very confusing and terribly structured course. She teaches things that you do not need tot know and is very difficult to talk to.,0
"Dr. Childs does not know logic, therefore she should not be teaching logic.",0
She doesn't clearly explain the assignment and grades extremely harshly. My friend took the same course with another teacher and I have been helping her quite a bit. She has managed to ace the course. I have put in a lot of work into my assignments and her topics are extremely boring and there isn't much room for brainstorming.,0
Boring lectures that aren't helpful and vague expectations. She'll go 20 minutes over on a conference to share personal stories while you wait on her to look over your essay. One of my worst experiences with a professor.,0
I think I've learned more in IDE and in doing the NXP car project than any other class. He's definitely the best professor I've had so far. His lectures aren't boring in the slightest. The labs are a lot of work but it's worth the knowledge you gain.,1
Great funny prof. Average grader for the course. 100% would take again,1
"Great professor. You can tell he really loves Italy and that he prides himself on being a scholar. He doesn't teach out of the book. Dr. Drake teaches you how to really think and break down a subject so that you can form your own opinions. Exams are bluebook. You state your opinion and back it up, theres not really right and wrong answers.",1
"A very bad professor. Slides, examples and explanations are ripped from the book and is incredibly rude to students in her class. Does not follow schedule, no syllabus given and exams/quizzes are not like the homework. Be prepared to the course coordinator or student advocate",0
"She is an awesome professor! I love when she teaches class, she knows what she is doing, and she keeps things fun and interesting. The class is difficult, but as long as you do your part, she'll do hers!",1
Dr. Kim has an accent that is hard to understand. I went to her office and she made me feel like I wasn't worthy to even be in Ochem because of my score. She is not nice outside of class and she is overall not good at teaching.,0
"Very clear instructions, wants everyone to participate. If you read the stories and attend class you will receive a good grade. Makes class interesting and choosing books with great topics. Overall a great professor.",1
"I had to take two classes with this teacher. The first semester all he gave us were two reading assignments with papers, providing little to help your grade if done poorly on them. Also his comments on papers are confusing and not helpful. With this teacher, be prepared to use sources such as smartthinking to help you and to work hard without help.",0
"This course was very heavy and I wouldn't recommend taking it over a short summer semester.  Otherwise, if you do the work as instructed you'll do fine.",1
"The best teacher, he is the gem of the IM department. Will help you no matter what you need. 10/10 would hug",1
"Please do not be fooled. He is average at best. I took him and his lectures are the blandest thing you will ever attend. Puts you to sleep every time. The only reason I kept going into class was for attendance points. # exams all consisted of learning 45-55 definitions, so if you can memorize it should be an easy A. He is not a good professor.",0
"She did not structure her 225 class very well. She is a fine lecturer but when it came to preparing for her exams, she didn't give us any practice material other than just studying the homework assignments for the first 2 exams. As a result, many students were having a hard time with the exams. She even threw some questions that weren't on the HW.",0
Great professor. Lots of knowledge from working for years. His grades are a point system. You have to get enough points for the grade you want. Its your fault if you don't get the grade you want. Doesn't accept late work or lame excuses.,1
Dr. D is such a caring and funny person. She teaches in a way that you remember the material and is wonderful about helping if you dont understand. Such a smart lady but so down to earth.,1
I took the night class which was like 3 hours long and he always made us stay until the very last second which would be fine if he wasn't so boring! He's cocky and makes you buy books that he wrote to read for the class. He talks about stuff that has nothing to do with sociology and he doesnt make sense. I dropped this class after the first week.,0
"Had my reservations about him prior, but this was the best class I had.  I heard he may teach other classes poorly but insurance is his wheelhouse.  He is undoubtedly an insurance super expert.  I learned an incredible amount.  Tests were not impossible but challenging.  I got all A's.  This class was for 3 hours long and in no way was boring.",1
"Excellent professor, I wish Mass Bay would give this professor more classes to teach. He made accounting exciting and not too dreadful. He gives homework only to make sure you understand the topic.",1
"Class was a little boring, but I definatly learned a lot about music.  The tests are pretty easy and straight from the notes if you study.  Just don't miss too many days!",1
"She doesn't email back, the tests don't make sense most of the time, and the whole ""flip the classroom"" thing is super confusing and doesn't help with actually learning.",0
"Gives terrible feedback, misspells almost everything, demands too much for how little he seems to care about the students.",0
So easy and cool and fun. I never participated but I still got an A. She requires a few papers and a simple presentation as the final.,1
"Celine is a strong and dedicated woman to her love of cinema and students. She is nice and brings up interesting topics during her lectures. Her pop quizzes are open book and she supervises her TAs when they grade papers. Follow her guidelines and you will get an A. She doesn't check attendance often, but I still went just in case.",1
"His classes are a combination of ethology, human psychology, biopsychology, and research psychology.  If you are not serious about the subject then you are in the wrong class.  If you want to be a well rounded psychologist/ethologist/bio or neuro psychologist/research psychologist then you need to at least attend some of his lectures.",1
A very clear professor with very good powerpoints for every lecture. Takes attendance and participation matters. Tests are fine provided you thoroughly understand the book and powerpoints.,1
"i got a B+ in this class and did so much work , only missed 3 classes and made up 2, and did extra bonus out of clsas work.  she gave someone a C+... she's moody and weird. avoid her if possible",0
A great class and friendly teacher. Attendance to both the yoga sessions and lectures are a must. You won't have to do the reading if you attend lectures.,1
"reads straight from textbook for lectures, very monotonous",0
Can not explain text in a why that is easily understood. Just repeats the text.,0
"First impression of Kata is that she has a strange accent, and after some more time in her class, you'll realize that's the least of her problems. She doesn't give guidelines about what she expects of her students, and she's highly disorganized. Definitely take someone else for 223.",0
"Attendence is mandatory. If you miss a class, your grade will immediately be affected. His lectures are somewhat boring but he does explain well. He loves to talk about environment and seems to love the Earth. Tests were difficult, but he allowed a double-sided cheat sheet.",1
Mostly all board work and covers 2 - 3 sections a day with little amount of information explained. Doesnt hand out study guides for tests. Expects students to do a heavy amount of homework and hw is graded. The quizzes are timed with 8min to complete it. He doesnt set you up for future success like other professors do. Good luck!,0
"I love Dr. H! She is by far my favorite professor at WKU. Her classes are well constructed, promote learning, and interesting. She's informative and responds quickly with questions. Even if you're not interested in Anth she makes it so if you try (which you should be doing) you can pass.",1
"Mrs. Johnson is very nice and wants her students to succeed.  Notes are printed off of blackboard and the tests are based off of these notes.  The only marginally hard part of the class is typing up the Sociological journal which is due mid-semester.  After the journal is finished, just study your notes and the tests are a breeze.",1
"Not as bad as people make him out to be. He seems to genuinely want to help those who make an effort, and changed things based on class feedback several times.",1
"The professor had many students that found the material challenging and does not try to explain the material thoroughly. I attended his office hours and even that was useless. He told me because Im not doing so well, that I should try again next semester with a smile on his face. I would not recommend taking his class unless you already know the m",0
This class was taken asynchronous. Overall my experience was okay. It was not the best. I have to agree with the failure to communicate directions for assignments and the lack of response through email. I know some prof have hard time with online Bc of the pandemic but online was just not it! I would not take again. I did not feel like I learned.,0
Kildea is awesome. Makes class fun with really funny and witty comments. Always there to help you if you need anything. Doesn't require a textbook.,1
She is really cool and easy going and she makes the class room interactive so you feel comfortable giving speeches. Attendance is mandatory but the class is not boring so its not bad. Also you have to study bc the quizzes and tests are pretty hard so dont go into publi speaking thinking it a blow off class.,1
"Worst teacher ever. Not clear on grading, online homework and tests are way harder than taught. Hes extremely rude, not just to students, but to older adult students. Will not listen or work with you. Changes grading rubric the last day of class. Im proficient in Spanish and I nearly got a C bc he cannot teach and expects you to know it on y own",0
Avoid!!! I wish someone would've told me about her earlier. Slick throws the shade if you don't understand something.,0
My growth as a musician in the short time that I've studied with this professor has been incredible. Her ability to convey musical concepts and explain in fine detail exactly what to do to produce the gorgeous sound and result that you're looking for is amazing. I love studying with her!,1
"Absolute worst professor at the university. Do not take him unless you can teach an entire course to yourself, otherwise, you won't pass. Over half of my class dropped. Will literally call you dumb to your face if you ask for help. AVOID",0
Very ez just show up it really as ez as that!!! If your looking for an A i would recomend this class,1
"If you are looking for an easy grade and a simple class, you have come to the right place. If you are here to learn, pass this one up.",1
"If you are terrible at math, avoid this class at all costs! She barely knows how to speak English. Her explanations just leave you more confused. You are better off watching Youtube videos for an explanation than listening to her.",0
Do not take this class Find another teacher. Id rather take an 8 am then taking an 11 am with her. She is one of the worst graders I ever had. She is so tough on students and will give an F if you are a few sentences away from the page requirements. Find another teacher because she is very annoying and unhelpful. No good feedback and no 2nd chances,0
"While Dr. Turkovic gives interesting lectures, the only thing his class is made up of are 4 tests, all in essay form and participating in class discussion. If you don't do well on those tests, you're pretty much screwed. I would not recommend taking this class if you are not a good test taker.",0
"This class was ABSOLUTELY awful. If you like not having curves, extra credit, or even being considered for partial credit, take this class.",0
"Huge GPA booster if you stay remotely up-to-date. Got 100% on all quizzes. No textbook needed, use her notes. Crammed for the final in 1 day, got 85% and 77% in the course. Would NOT recommend though if you have absolutely no interest in the course; I lost marks because I didn't care enough to even attempt the assignments. Yes, I'm garbage.",0
Dr. Yamazaki is one of the hardest but most amazing professors Ive ever taken! Although her tests and quizes can be brutal she trully cares about her students and prepares you for any professional program. Take her physiology courses if you want to learn and can handle a chanllenge.,1
"Only 1 final paper about 8-10 pages. 10 small assignment to lead you to your final paper. Those assignment were really helpful. She gives good feedback, and you will actually learn how to write a great paper.",1
He is a very goo d professor. He makes music as an interesting subject to work. He works out with his students and tells them what to study on before tests. His study guides are extremely helpful. I recommand anyone to take his class,1
Dr. Nesvig is one of the best teachers I've ever had. He is incredibly passionate about the material and genuinely wants to see you do well. The class isn't too difficult if you put in the work. He's also hilarious and makes each class very entertaining. I'm so glad I decided to take this class! HIGHLY recommended!!,1
"The content is interesting but gets spoiled by the teaching. All the material assigned as reading is recovered in class in long-drawn-out ways. The rhetorical style is boring, causing most students to get sleepy until being cold-called in the middle of a class to answer a specific question. If you do a lot of work you'll do well, but it's a pain",0
WORST TEACHER EVER! she took points off assignments because of stupid things like forgetting to put the feet sign. and not just one point when i did this but 3.,0
Easily the worst professor I've had at UK. Don't bother asking him a question in class because it's a guarantee he will miss it and a student will have to correct him. And he does very little explaining how he gets his answers. Would not recommend,0
Professor Young is a great teacher! She doesn't take attendance but you have daily quizzes on the homework problems. She is extremely willing to help you and will make sure you understand the material for the tests. She gives you practice tests that are very similar to the actual test. I would highly recommend taking a class with her!,1
Not recomended if you can help it will not be a enjoyable class,0
Hard teacher ,0
Theres daily readings for about 1/4 of the given book. Lectures were given by student instead of her. You may even be able to plagiarize as she lets it slide. Nothing is posted online so dont expect to keep track of it. Never went off the syllabus.,0
Gave assignments with no direction and everything was subjective grading. You will probably be fine if he likes you but his style is ridiculous and i would never take him again. Was not an understanding guy and it was always his way or the highway.,0
"Very smart, arrogant. Counter intuitive point of view. Buy his book or Economics of Strategy not Kotler. Attack his theories and learn to be humiliated. Very approachable but has draconian rules about homework/presentations. Don't piss him off and don't talk about things you don't understand. Don't expect solutions to cases and enjoy the ride.",1
He is so nice and easy to talk to if i had any problems. the best english teacher i ever had,1
"This class is horribly boring, it is impossible to follow the lecture becuse she is jumping all over the place and very unclear. Attendence is graded so you have to come to class. Tests are easy though, but this was literally the worst class I have ever taken at UMass.",0
"I am not sure who failed for missing three classes, but I am not one for attending class as often as I should, and I definitely missed more than three classes in 315 and I didn't even come close to failing. In other words, this class was amazing! Keeling is amazing, and super sweet and SO intelligent. I learned more here than in any other class!",1
Gives a lot of detail and examples in lecture. Prone to tangents and rants. Her tests are challenging but she tells you exactly what type of problem will be on the exam.,1
"Dr. Day is pretty friendly, easy to talk to, and willing to help. The majority of the points for the class are in the labs which can be difficult but Dr. Day usually has very good input if you're stuck. The tests are open note, but some of the material on them is only mentioned in class. Lectures aren't particularly helpful aside from that though.",1
"Worst teacher Ive ever had. His study guides for the tests are 17 pages of stuff listed that you need to know. Jokes around about failing and says there is always next semester, good luck passing his class with a C. You can study and work your ass off just to barley pass. Hes a dr so expect to have as much knowledge as him and retain everything.",0
"He Cannot teach, he undoubtedly knows the material but is incapable of explaining it in a way that is understandable. He has horrible hand writing and jumps all over the board making it impossible to follow his teaching. He doesnt offer help to students who ask and he supplies test review and then test you on material that wasnt on the review.",0
He is amazing and wonderful  i wont be tired getting his classes..............                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,1
"Absolutely amazing prof. Funny, engaging, but also very educated. Really made the subject matter interesting. Extremely friendly... and simply adorable. Prepare to have a good time in class!",1
"Professor Bailey is a great teacher. The course is pretty straight forward. She's a fair and easy grader for the most part. Be prepared to read and write a lot, but as long as you turn your assignments in, you should get a good grade. Class outline: 5-6 essays, peer reviews, journal and discussion boards. Overall, I would highly recommend her.",1
"How this woman teaches is beyond me. Knows the material but is completely useless attempting to convey the knowledge to students. Reads off slides (info directly from book; created by TA) entire class. Takes attendance. Homework is meaningless so long as you make an attempt as she doesn't check it. Do the HW, know review sheet, get a good grade.",0
"Her class is project heavy so be prepared to put in a lot of hours. Her quizzes are what makes her class little challenging but she gives review slides for preparation after each lecture. Quizzes are short answers, not multiple choice. Memorize it. If you need an A, then you would have to work hard. Period. She is brilliant and knows her stuff.",1
"Honestly, a great teacher. He goes out of his way to provide a weekly homework help section, and will also have out of class reviews for exams. Example problems are well done and thorough, and he teaches how to do the physics, rather than just to use the equations. HOWEVER, his exams are challenging, so be aware of that!",1
"Great Professor. She's young and relates things we learn in class to up to date scenarios that interest us. She gives you review sheets for her tests which is very useful. Her homework assignments don't take too long and are very useful when preparing for a test. Overall, one of the best professors Ive ever had. Highly recommended",1
"she seems a little spaced out sometimes, or shes very forgetful about things.  shes a nice person but that wont help you learn anything!",0
"Will is an amazing teacher! He really connects to his students and wants you to succeed as much as possible, but he'll put in the work when you do.",1
I took Math2120 with Dr. Gueye and he's knowledgeable. His review was really useful for the final exam,1
"don't take this class with her.  She is out to fail all nursing majors and to crush your dreams.  Also, she was never a nurse herself - only her MOM.  How can she judge other nurses....",0
"His class is incredibly challenging,but his classes are incredibly interesting. He's a tough grader.",1
"He is super funny and I enjoy going to this class. He only assigns a midterm and a final, which are in forms of take home essays.  He makes class interesting, I recommend taking.",1
The online class 'Intro to Islamic Civilization' was an absolute mess; quiz questions were from material not yet covered or material that was never covered and the prof tries way too hard to be funny. I really feel that I learned almost nothing from this class and online the prof does not look as hot as some have previously posted,0
"10-week course! There are a total of 5 exams but the last one is optional (will drop the lowest exam score if the 5th exam is taken and it covers chapter 1-17). The course is very easy and self explanatory: read the textbook, take good notes, and you should receive an A for each exam! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE!",1
"Totally incompetent.  Will spend 10 minutes giving an example, only to realize she did the whole thing wrong and have to go back and re-do it.  Totally useless topic and I can't believe people actually devote their lives to studying it.",0
"Sometimes politically incorrectmisinformed and was condescending and one-sided towards some cultures, despite this being a class about ethnicity- you'll see what I mean. The tests and notes were so scattered, making it hard to study. Shows movies that I felt had little relevance to the larger topics.",0
"Rick is a super nice guy, he worked for the Fed for many years, so he has a lot of knowledge when it comes to financial institutions.",1
"Dr. Nelson was an awesome teacher! I am a journalism major with no interest in science and I really enjoyed the class. Make the effort to get to know him and you will have a good time in this class. There is not an attendance requirement, the tests aren't awful, and the textbook is really not needed.",1
"I love this professor. He is helpful and neat with everything. He even decided to make the quizzes a group. When you do the clicker, it is just to show that you are present in class.",1
"He was very unforgiving, very harsh grader, and gave homework every class session.",0
Worst professor ever. I did not learn a single thing in that class and he was rude! Do not take his class if you want to learn.,0
"One of the worst professors that have ever had. I was behind, due to a sudden shift in work scheduling  and contacted her through email. That vfery same day,  and requested to contact her at her office phone and that she was available until 9 that evening. It was 4 pm and I called after I saw the message,  called, and she never answered or emailed.",0
"Linda is an excellent teacher.  She really makes the class interesting and has a great personality.  I learned far more in her lab than in the a and p 2 lecture. Tests are easy: multiple choice, matching, fill in the blank-not tricky.  Tests also include identifying body parts on dissected animals so make sure you pay attention when you do it.",1
"Class can be tough, but if you do the readings then you're fine.  The labs are definitely exhausting, but you learn a lot in a short period of time.",1
"Compared to all the other physics professors that I have heard about, Oks sounds like a saint. He really was a good professor. he gave decent lectures and would answer any questions students had. Would do some demos to make lecture more interesting. Tests were multiple choice and open book, so a little challenging there. You get what you work for!",1
Do not take this class... Professor was not good at telling students what they need and don't need to know. Wasted countless hours studying material that I would never need to know because she said we would.,0
SO sweet and caring. The nicest guy ever. Lectures can be boring but study guides are posted before the mid-term and test-just memorize it and you'll get an A. Often plays his cello and other instruments in class. Lots of listening and videos. As long as it looks like you tried on assignments you'll get full credit. FAVORITE CLASS I'VE TAKEN,1
"I enjoyed the lectures and the prof's sense of humor.  Sometimes I thought lectures were a bit too easy for an advanced course, but overall the pace of the course was good.  I would have liked more homework so I could have more feedback on my understanding of the material.  The professor also thinks EVERY topic in the course is easy.",1
"Honestly disappointed since I thought this class would be greatI'm interested in the topic. However, for the vagueness of her teaching, her tests are extremely specific and trickily worded. I felt like she was trying to trick us the whole time I was taking her tests and it was really frustrating to know you studied your hardest but won't get an A.",0
"Sometimes speeds through lectures, but you can view them online.  Very entertaining professor, as long as you attend class and do assignments you will get an A. I had Shaun as  TA and he was awesome. Online tests, do your papers early (two 1500 words papers for the semester) so the TA can go over it and tell you what to fix. Loved learning material",1
U will be shocked of his TOO complicated & unorganized syllabus! he says it is 3 short writing assignments short means(2500-3000 words)also u need to do a project with many requirements. U need to write one analysis paper (MC) as HW every week. he let u do Lots of reading then he never talk about what u read. u will be confused of what he wants.,0
"I took him for a class that was actually about religion and science. He is the most biased professor I've ever had. He talks nonsense, trying to make intelligent, well spoken students feel like idiots. There's no point in reasoning with this gorilla.",0
"The best Poli Sci professor I've had at State. The way he synthesizes his lectures and the readings into the course material is unreal. Lectures are engaging and interesting every class! Tough grader on the papers no doubt, but beyond the papers and attendance, not much else work-wise. TAKE HIM!",1
"She's a veryyyy nice lady. There is a lot that you go over as it covers alll of Africa. But, it is an easy A. She's very clear on what she wants and studys for the exams with you the class before the exam. Don't get the book. I brought it to class once and never used it after.",1
"Mandatory reading every week - approx. 100 pages. Multiple choice midterm, 8-10 page near the end of the quarter, and a relatively difficult in-class essay final. During lecture, Prof. Perez stated that his class was NOT going to be an easy class at all. Thank god I ""S/NC"" this class.. If you're looking for an easy ""A"", look elsewhere",0
This was one of my worse experience with a professor. She gave so many papers (2 per week) Plus she gave an entire 15 page research paper with only 2 weeks to complete it. Plus 2 5 page papers due that same week. On top of that her instructions were terrible and she grades so hard! I would not recommend her to anyone. Everything was too repetitive.,0
"Maybe for the English language courses she's worth it, but not for any Spanish language courses. This woman can not even pronounce certain spanish words incorrectly. She needs to stick to political feminist college classes in english rather than intelligent spanish classes.",0
"Two exams, coaching assignments, he has a review day before exams. No surprises great guy great teacher",1
Extremely unhelpful and cancelled office hours frequently.  Tests were very difficult and had questions that weren't anything like our homework or lecture examples.  He used different notation and equations than our textbook which made following him in lecture difficult.  Doesn't post any lecture notes or solutions to homework or tests online.   ,0
"I'm really unsure why people gave him such good reviews. He's a great guy, horrible professor. He only puts up 4 or 5 grades a semester and 4 of them are tests. He teaches his 101 class like a 300 class and goes way too deep into geography. He doesn't teach what Geography 101 warrants. He's also incredibly monotone and difficult to listen to.",0
"Hard hard class, but all psych majors have to take it and take it with her. She expalins things and gives packets that will help you to learn and to understand. Yay for part takehome tests",1
"His lectures can be long and note-taking is a must if you want to pass the tests. He provides all the material you need to get an A in the class. Study guides for every single test with the answers given to you, practically word-for-word. If you do the study guides, you should pass the class no problem. Labs are fun. Lab attendance necessary.",1
"For a level 100 gen-ed class , she treats the class as if it's a level 400 class. I had more work in this class then in my upper-level major courses. There is little to no clarity on what is expected from you and the materials that are needed. If you need help, don't ask as you will only be ridiculed for asking. Godspeed to all who take her course.",0
I have taken this professor twice. Her class is easy. She is very nice and helpful. She explains what she wants to see in your papers/assignments very well and clearly. You can tell she wants her students to succeed and be interested in what she teaches. Don't miss your opportunity to take her class!She is great!,1
"I loved her online class, Anthropology 1. Everything is detailed and she is organized, due dates are correct. she responses e-mail quickly. Well organized set up helps students to focus on the subject.",1
Very passionate professor. There's only 4 essays but the prompts are so specific and he practically addresses them in lecture. Easy A. It's REALLY hard to fail this class.,1
She's fantastic!!!! She's always there to help with anything!,1
"The course work is just watching a movie weekly and discussion boards. What I don't like is how she has us post everyday in the discussion and have a ""conversation"" with other classmates. It seems ridiculous to do that because it's just about a movie, then we have to also participate in class. There is just a lot of participation involved.",0
"Doesn't reply emails, doesn't want to help students, doesn't respect international students",0
"If you just want to take the course, yes he's a generous grader. If you want to do some research, you should rethink about it",0
"this is a immersion style class which makes it very difficult to overcome for first year students. spanish is already spoken fast, which makes it hard to learn crucial grammar rules. She cares about her students and is a organized teacher. Last thing is the class moves very fast",1
Hes cool,1
"This Professor doesn't not reply back to you for days.  It took him over a month to grade all the papers.  This is a self taught class, not help there. Writing papers every week then a final paper plus midterm test and final. His questions are confusing.",0
Read straight from the powerpoints all semester and did nothing to make the class interesting. Attendance is mandatory so you actually have to sit through the class.,0
Very easy course online. Its a self teaching course with only three due dates for the semester. All you have to do is follow the book step by step for coding projects which make for easy assignments.,1
"Tries to push you to the online website for the book but ended up not using it.  Directions are sometimes confusing.  Don't be silent, ask the question and you will do just fine.",1
"Nice person, not a good teacher. Forgetful, unorganized & hard to follow. Textbook is useless. Study guides are just a bunch of vocab words. I dont even have enough space to tell everything thats wrong. Just avoid if you can. This should be an EASY A but i settled for a B+ with WAYYY more effort than need be for a friggin history class.",0
"Dhavan is hands down the best prof I've had. He worked for Leo Burnett on McD's, so he has great experience and loves sharing it. He gives excellent feedback, but be ready, because he's going to be honest with you. He tells some really great stories, too. If you have a chance to take a class with him, take it.",1
"Shes very enthusiastic. She cuts students off in the middle of them giving answers or speaking. Even if you remotely have the right answer shell stop you and say the answer her way. She reads off her PPT slides word for word. You really only need to go to class to get names of IDs. Would not take again, she makes students feel like theyre stupid",1
"the worst ever. she makes the course so so so hard. also, she challenges the students. She feels satisfies if the student can't answer her quizzes or exams.",0
"Had Rick for 260 as well as an online course - He's never failed to be condescending and rude when asked a question, especially if he thinks the student should know the answer. Doesn't know how to teach the material in his class and gets upset when the entire class performs poorly on an exam that was written like he wanted everyone to fail. Avoid!.",0
didn't learn a thing!,0
Would avoid this instructor.,0
"She seems a little scary at first but she's not at all.  Just ask questions and read the assignments and you will be fine. Personally, I think she's awesome.",1
"I was interested in taking the class because I'm a non-science major, but she was TERRIBLE. Ended up dropping it actually, she was very disorganized, read from power points the whole class, and the tests were the oddest of questions, like what animals roam in her backyard. In addition, her accent didn't help, and she never answered questions.",0
nope,1
"Worst teacher/professor I've ever had. She's a scatterbrain who loses work, gives inaccurate grades, plays favorites, and is always in a bad mood. She gives free grades out to students who help her with yearbook during class and gives grades based on if she likes you or not. I literally learned not one thing from taking her English Comp class.",0
"Very lazy professor, have him 2 times a week. On the monday or tuesday class we spend half the time watching videos submitted by students explaining a problem from the hw which is a waste of time. The other day of his class he sends out pre recorded lectures. If I had to describe him in one word I would struggle deciding between lazy or disengaged.",0
"He was very chill at first, said that he only uses 2 hours out of 3 hours maximum, and does not require textbooks. And I thought he was a good professor. After a few classes, I saw how lazy he was. He posts another prof's notes on blackboard and expects you to read it before class, and in class he barely teaches. He's very lazy.",0
really hard class. lectures are irrelevant to midterms and final. midterms and final contain unseen problems,0
"Great guy. Average professor. You can fall behind fast in this class, so prioritize it over others. Plenty of EC. Main downside, taught in Java!? C'mon it's 2018. So beware, this class is more difficult than it needs to be because it is taught in cavemen language. Teach JS or Python based stacks. More job opportunities and it'll be easier to teach.",0
Gupta's idea of teaching is to read the textbook's provided slides while waving his hands around in front of the class as if the students have come in to class knowing the material. Anything that becomes difficult for him to describe is ultimately left out of the lecture. There is also no curve in the class.,0
"Took his class online, very confusing to say the least. Syllabus timeline is unclear, quiz directions are unclear. Midterm is timed, most of the students didn't get a chance to complete the MC part. I want to say that this class would be an easy A if his instructions were clear and if the midterm wasn't timed.",0
"I would never want to take this professor again. I took a 100 level class and it required so much work! I wrote at least 12 papers and had to do a 15 minute presentation with a group. Very boring lectures, assigns a lot of homework, tough grader, and assignments weren't explained very well at all. I do NOT recommend this professor at all!!",0
Took the course over the summer and it was the easiest course I've taken at UCF. He lectures during the active learning labs which are somewhat interesting. 1/4 your grade is easy participation. 1/4 is discussions that you only have to hit the word count. 1/4 is a final paper that is super easy. 1/4 is quizzes that are actually moderately difficult,1
"Dr. Bailey is a tough professor. His lectures are very organized, but he goes back on his word a lot. He printed out notes for us, but he would skip slides during lecture. There are no extra credit and the test are pretty hard. I recommend doing the practice problem over and over again until you can do them in your sleep. I zoned out a lot in class",0
This was one of my favorite teachers I've had at Brookhaven so far. You could tell he truly cared about each student and wanted them to pass. He even gave me good tips about my future that I took to heart. He encouraged me to continue my education past my associates. His class is hard but I would recommend it if you want to actually learn something,1
"Margarita is a wonderful teacher and a very nice, intelligent person. It's true that her classes move fast, but there is a lot of material to cover in 10 weeks. That's why LBCC offers free tutoring. I took SPN 102, 103, 201, 202 and 203 from her, and loved it.",1
Gives you many videos and lecture that do not help. She is okay with responding to emails. But does go the extra mile so pros and cons. The textbook is useless with the work given and would not take again.,0
"The class itself was not hard. The material was pretty straight forward, especially if you read. Lab, however, was not structured well at all, it took months for assignments to be graded, and the professor flew through procedure and was concerned more about keeping up his aforementioned tough persona than actually teaching.",0
"Often misunderstood: In class, she is not only teaching the subject but also a very singular conception of ""the professor"" and of the philosophy of teaching, through a self-conceived postmodern performatic method, that makes use of facial gesture, body language, and vocal expression, plus sartorial and make-up props: A truly revolutionary method.",1
"I have no background in Middle Age History and I took his Medieval Heresy Seminar Course! Dr. Sheffler is very helpful, loves participation and drops 2 lowest papers. Average grader. Not easy, but doesn't butcher you on misplaced comma either. State your arguments clearly in writing. Pay attention on your papers.Super cute!",1
"Amazing professor, take his classes and see.",1
"Always too busy to help students. Doesn't answer emails. Doesn't care about his students, especially graduate students who are trying to graduate. You have to beg and plead for an answer. I wish I had as good of an experience as some of these reviews, but he's the worst professor I've ever had. Maybe it would be better if he had an assistant.",0
"Terrible professor. Extremely unprofessional, pushed off big assignments for ones that didnt matter as much. She has a lot of experience to share with you, but is very close minded & not open to other view points. IMPOSSIBLE to contact outside of class and not very accommodating. Inconsistent grading.",0
Pretty whack professor. Class is basically unrelated to the homework which is from the book and the book is easily as whack as the professor himself. Very unclear about everything and the exams are brutal.,0
Not too inspirational. Very by the book. Could stand to liven class up a bit since it's math and math is not that great to begin with! All in all he's a nice guy just not very riveting.,0
"Never replied emails!! The feedback he gave me in the extended outline is ""plz insert page number"" and then gave me a 65%. excuse me?? Then another feedback said, ""your final results are different with the results in previous work you submitted, plz explain."" Why? because I found I was wrong in the previous one and now I wanna correct it! Can't I?",0
"This course is pretty simple as long as you keep up with the work, but if you have a question and email her, she isn't the best at giving you a straight answer and can even come off as rude. She sends me emails telling me how i did bad and some of the reasoning is not even true...",1
Murtuza is a bro! Always willing to help. Sometimes his handwriting is hard to read on the board and he talks kindof quietly. All you have to do is ASK HIM TO REPEAT and he always will because he genuinely cares. Ask for help during or outside of class and he'll even schedule extra office hours. He had Sat & Sun hours during finals week for us.,1
"although he might be the easiest prof ever exist on the planet, he could be mean sometimes. if you dont follow the rule ur grade will went down, he can't really teach and i can't hear him at all.",0
She is the most amazing prof. I've had while I've been at North Greenville!!!,1
"Prof. List makes you do the homework, or you won't pass. Gives extra credit and is caring. His passion for the subject is amazing and makes me want to major in geology. He explains his lectures by using hand movements which can be hilarious when you watch him. He is a great Teacher, highly recommend his classes and the Lab as well.",1
Kevin is excellent. He wants you to learn something. Always has excellent feedback and input.,1
Good prof and very care about students. She could explain the question very clear but her test was very hard. Her few extra credit can not change the grade and some questions of the test are you never seen before.,0
"Dr. Kellman is very passionate about this course. Although she appears to be more of a researcher than a teacher, she made sure her course material was well organized and easy to understand. Her tests are very simple and she clearly wants everyone to do well. Definitely an interesting and relevant course, and a grade booster!!",1
"No matter how interested you think you are in this subject, trust me, it's not enough to justify taking this class. Impossibly hard.",0
A very nice and approachable professor who was willing to meet with me. Be sure to ask for help as many of the students thought that they were doing fine on their projects and then dropped the class when they found out otherwise.,1
"He's a great professor who loves what he does. His class requires work, but he's always willing to help.",1
"very fair marker and entertaining lecturer (although sometimes irrelevant material) Go to the super tutorial, you'll get a good mark.",1
"Mrs. McGee is an amazing instructor. She is fun, silly, hilarious, really cute, and a great at teaching the material. Her class is not easy, so don't be mistaken, you just need to put in the effort by studying. I had one of the highest averages in the class and still felt stressed at times. Its all about studying! I highly recommend her.",1
"I took a lecture-heavy course, so there wasn't much room for different activities or any type of variety, but that's not his fault. He's a solid professor who is generous with partial credit and knows how to teach stats. You can't go wrong with him.",1
"Dr. Nguyen was my favorite professor I've ever had! He's really the only professor in philosophy who made me read the texts, which is pretty rare in the philosophy department. He will make you work hard, but in the end, you'll know so much more than when you first walked into his class. If you truly want to learn philosophy, he's the one for you.",1
"ALa,gk, is such a good teacher and human. She is easily accessible and understanding if you need her help. The work load is fun and light . Math can be tough, she only gives a couple of math assignments with none on the final.",1
He gives a test every week. He does not know how to use the software for the class. He does not speak English well. He is not a nice person,0
"In my opinion, she is a very caring teacher and is very good at teaching the material. She would have live weekly sessions where she would go over the chapter and would explain the material that we should know from the test. I did feel her tests were challenging and to get an A on the tests seemed hard. Her labs seemed pretty simple.",1
Yikes. He's super passionate about what he teaches and will give you help if you're very specific about what you want but nobody did any of the reading. The quizzes (which you must check the syllabus for) were easy if you went to class. It's hard to not get an A and you'll come out with interesting info but he talks through videos which is annoying,1
"My favorite course at Walsh. I kept all books after class ended and still refer to them almost monthly. Do all extra credit including the grammar book. Tons of reading and tons of work, but I found it valuable and eye opening. Do a little of the living case study each week to make the end of class more manageable. I would highly recommend McHann.",1
Dr. Birx is a very well educated man who knows what he is talking about. His class is completely revolved around class participation. If you do not like getting randomly called on do not take this class. There are only 6 grades and they are all exams. If you do not read the chapters and come to class everyday expect to fail.,1
"BEST TEACHER EVER!!! This was my first workout class that I have taken in college,so going into the course I was very nervous.So I'm so glad I took her course because she makes you feel comfortable working out and encourages you to reach the goal you set for yourself in the course. Best teacher ever!!!",1
"You need to read a lot by yourself. His grading most on lecture quizzes, but just be careful. And lab quizzes are not hard.",0
Professor Schlorrt gives excellent and hilarious lectures. You will learn a great deal about history if you take the class. He gives a lot of feedback on assignments telling you what to do better. Some might say the feedback is harsh. I would say it is fair. He gives you good grades and will help you pass by dropping assignments! You'll learn a lot,1
"Dont take her, worst prof ever. She single handedly ruined my GPA even though I put most of effort in her class.",0
"i had a tough time in this class, i felt it was really difficult. she gave multiple pop quizzes and one midterm and a final. when i did the final, i really thought i was going to fail this class but once i took the final i have no idea what i did but i ended up getting a good grade in the class.",0
"Overall I really enjoyed this class. It was very easy and she was really up front and honest. However, she did offer extra credit 2 times but then counted it as a regular paper. Not sure if she just got confused or what happened. I still received an a in her class though.",1
"Great teacher. However, your GPA will not thank you. He is overly ambitious with the amount of information he tries to teach. His expectations for essays are ridiculous; papers that would easily get an A in other English classes will bring you Bs in an O'Quinn class. You need to think like him to get a good mark. Good teacher, evil marker.",1
class discussion was interesting,1
"If you want to take a class and memorize definitions word for word and get points taken off if you alter one word, hes your guy. Ask questions but beware hell make you regret it. Good luck (:",0
very unprepared  and doesnot no how to teach he maybe very knowledgeable on the subject but doesn't know how to give us knowledge on the subject,0
If u are willing to waste an entire semester without learning a single thing about English u should go ahead and take it.. It seems more like history class rather than English his talks too too much about nonsense and leaves way to much papers and gives no help what so ever with the papers and grades really harsh! Be smart and do N0T take his class,0
"Super great professor. He loves class discussions but you won't be penalized if you don't speak, though he may ask you a random question here and there. Take notes every class and he may grade them at the end of the semester. He is different for every class but we only had one midterm and one final with little homework. Super nice and very caring!!",1
"His English is very difficult to understand Lab and Lecture are totally not relevant Youtube video, link on lectures are useless Regret going to KPU because of his class",0
"Nancy is an incredible teacher.  I have never worked so hard in a class for such a low grade, yet knowing I learned so much.  I always had the feeling that we spoke a slightly different language, as my essays (which I did well with in every other class I have ever taken), seemed to always be taken differently than I meant them.  But regardless, I learned so much and admired her tremendously.",1
"Lectures are terrible, and to make them worse, she quiz at the beginning or end of the lecture. Not organized and I felt genuinely did not care about teaching.",0
"DONT TAKE HER. VERY UNPREPARED, ALL OVER THE PLACE. DOESNT TEACH. EXPECTS YOU TO LEARN ON YOUR OWN. THIS SHOULD BE AN ONLINE CLASS. SERIOUSLY.",0
"One of the nicest professors i've had in my college career. Has never tried to trick any one about the content of her quizzes and exams. She's been very clear about what to expect. And honestly even if you zone out a bit in class, the book tells you everything you need. Just read/scan through before taking a test. Amazing.",1
I learned a lot this class,1
"Professor Humber isn't very good, though he does try. His tests are difficult, but he grades very easy, though sometimes it's frustrating how arbitrary his qualifications are. Take him if you want a decent grade without too much work (at least, in comparison to other sections), but if you really want a good Calc II professor, try someone else.",0
"Professor Jagpal is brilliant, and exhausting. He will be critical of the content you provide (both participation and graded assignments), but he rewards effort. He will lecture for two or three hours, but I found it interesting. I had no knowledge of marketing coming into the class, and I appreciated his seemingly novel take on it.",1
"Dr. Feige was an amazing professor. Im currently reviewing anatomy for my nursing admissions exam and everything Dr. Feige taught me, stayed in my head! He makes videos to help students understand difficult topics & his homework is great review for his exams. Hands down best anatomy professor, he goes above and beyond to help students succeed.",1
She doesn't answer emails. She gave me a 0 on an assignment that I completed. Only gives two tests a midterm and final which are take home. Never get any quizzes.,0
"Very scatterbrained, not organized at all, I do not recommend taking her at all.",0
"I loved this class. Danish is a difficult language to learn, but he teaches it in a way that really makes sense. He made me look forward to come to class every day & speak, even though it's a hard language. He made the language exciting, and really helped us fall in love with Denmark and the culture. Plus he's hilarious, so that was fantastic too!",1
"He explains concepts with examples that greatly help students who do not have any programming background to learn computer science. He also gives a lot of exercises for students to practice. I would have given him a 5 rating if he did not teach in a very fast pace, trying to squeeze all the material in a summer course.",1
Took his online class and what he expects from you is extremely confusing and difficult. His tests are ridiculous (45 questions in 35 mins) and 3 essays in 75 mins (plus identifications) I suggest dropping his class immediately if you have the luck to get him.,0
"Ms. V is an awesome teacher. Class was very easy. I had not previously taken any chemistry. But most of her information she will give you right off the slides in class, she provides study guides for tests and is very helpful in answering questions, very kind and happy demeanor. Recommend her!",1
Great Professor. As long as you do the reading and re-read slides you can pass the class with a good grade. Discussions are a key part of the curriculum. Took it during summer and therefore it was very reading intensive. Clicker questions about the readings. Just do what youre suppose to to and youll be fine. Is lenient with attendance.,1
"Professor Heilman is a super passionate and very knowledgeable professor. I learned a lot from her class because her lectures were interesting and attention-grabbing. For a 100 level class, this course had a lot more homework than I expected. That said, all the homework was graded very fairly and it is easy to do well if you watch lectures",1
The other recent review is 100% correct. He doesn't acknowledge technical issues and is not clear about what material is on which quiz. The material is VERY disorganized and instructor isn't helpful at all. Either ignores emails/discussions or just responds that he thinks everything is self-explanatory. Many students post questions that are ignored,0
"The class content is not difficult.  The professor makes it difficult by setting her own criteria for grading that is not part of the assignment.  Elizabeth does not follow the rubric, does not answer questions, and makes up erroneous grading criteria.  She doesn't even understand the course she is teaching. Worst excuse for an instructor.",0
She is one of the best teachers. If you are interested in marketing she is a must have teacher. you learn a lot.,1
"Mike has very long lectures, it seems like they drag on forever, but if you pay attention you will be okay! There isn't homework except for blackboard quizzes about once a week maybe twice. Make sure you study for the exams, look over powerpoints, he puts all the notes on blackboard!",1
"Professor Lipson is obviously a very knowledgeable person, but his soothing voice and his tangential lecture style makes it hard for me to stay engaged in the class. Ive learnt a lot from this professor from the first half of the semester, but as the semester progressed I felt he was pushing many claims without a strong base of evidence.",0
"Mr. Stacey is one of the best Professor I ever had. His discussion is very clear and  he would give you hints of whatever will be on the test and make sure you listen to his lecture and I guarantee you, you will get an easy A. He is also always there to help you. He would respond to your questions quick. He would give you your grades within a day.",1
"Class is very unorganized to the point where self-researching the quiz/test topics is where I actually learned anything. Tons of topics that are tested on and required to know yet only briefly mentioned in class, so studying for tests became looking up all the given 'key terms' on wikipedia. Lectures skip around and make no cohesive sense.",0
"Espo is one of my favorite teachers I've ever had, at first he seemed terrifying, but he's truly a funny and nice guy. His class has taught me a lot and we always have meaningful discussions. He's very passionate about what he teaches. Assigns 1 paper a week but they aren't too hard and are usually 1-2 pages. Really improved my writing. ",1
"all you have to do is write papers. They dont even have to be good. You'll probably get an A on the paper, if he remembers to grade them. the lowest grade i ever got on a paper was a 92, but he forgot to grade one of my papers so it went in as incomplete and i almost couldnt have english 112. It eventually got turned into an F and i recieved a B.",0
Fliping awsome,1
Class was a little difficult for me.. Hes a cool guy and loves to travel which you hear a lot about. Just study the notes on the slides and know your maps! Also you read a book that is actually good so dont worry about it. Funny Guy!,1
GREAT TEACHER! I would take her again!,1
Come to class and pay attention and you'll pass. It's just that simple. The homework was never overly difficult since he does a lot of work in class with you. He's pretty funny and very helpful.,1
Taking him for fall semester at lbcc. Math 115 class which is a new class that is equivalent to math 130 ! And he is the worst math teacher  ever!!!!! He goes off subjeCT 85% of the time test are worrh50% of your grade! Study guides are a little helpful!  Not good at explaining problemsAT ALL its best to teach yourself or use mathlab  dont take him,0
"Professor Bamford is a fantastic professor here at QU. Caring, committed, and always willing to help her students, she is one of the best professors I have had at QU.",1
"He is really smart, but does not know how to get across the information. He expects memorization over over 180 pgs of text for the first test-- and this is 100 level!!  I am a good student, and probably will not pass this class.  Wish he had a teaching mentor to help him decrease content and make it LEVEL-appropriate.  It really is too bad.",0
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED do not let her be your 1st choice. She is a kind teacher &loves math but she is higly confusing&wants you to spell out each word&number if your problem is 2+24 she wants you to explain why and how do you know for a fact that  4. Makes everything more confusing than what it needs 2b. Group projects? what are we in highschool?,0
Not a tough grader at all but the time limits for quizzes and exams are rough. This professor is knowledgeable and knows his topic but if you arent crazy about art history you will hate this class. Online classes are difficult as it is but this one was a downright struggle for me.,0
Awesome,1
"Wasn't clear with the other instructor on what she wanted in answers. Marks the whole question wrong if you leave out one Sig Fig or don't label something. She isn't easy to talk to, every time I tried to have a conversation with her she put the blame back on me. Wasn't able to do problems the way I was taught in High School without it being wrong.",0
"Ehh.. how should I say this. Weird teacher... She is a joke, too easy for teaching a science course and she is not that good at teaching. She writes almost the same examples on the board 24/7 and asks you to solve. She doesn't really care if you get the materials or not while she sounds like she cares... Oh well.. take her for a mickey mouse class.",0
Lecture then test.  That is it.  Nothing Complicated.  I recomend him,1
Do not take this class online. His tests are about 75 questions each worth 0.15 points. His weekly participation assignments are multiple questions that EACH have to be answered with 150-600 words depending on what he says the minimum is. The exercises arent always answered using the text and his lecture slides aren't always helpful or available.,0
Taking this class during covid 19 pandemic. His setup is a camera pointed at the whiteboard. It is constantly unfocused and he stands in front of his writing making it very hard to take notes. I contacted the engineering department to help set him up with a digital whiteboard and was told he had one and didn't want to use it.,0
"Dr. Cornish is honestly one of the best professors at UNI. She is SO caring and understanding. She really takes the time to get to know her students. Her classes are not challenging, come to class and you are fine. Even if you don't come to class read some material you'll be fine. I could talk about how wonderful she is all day. You will LOVE her",1
No Comments,0
I DO NOT recommend her for Microbiology! She makes it very hard for no reason and expects you to just know everything. The lectures doesn't really help because it's pretty much the slides that are posted on bb. Exams are super hard! But she does curve at the end depending on the class average.,0
Only offered one extra credit assignment out of the whole semester. She does not answer emails regarding questions or grading. When I asked questions in her class she made me feel stupid and when I asked for help she just told me to figure it out on my own. Honestly your pretty much on your own.,0
"After reading good reviews, I was excited to learn about crim in a sociological context. LA's lectures are painfully dull and boring, you're better off staying home and reading the text and slides. Shes super dismissive and seems to revel in her white privilege. Always uses same weird anecdote about her being able to drink vs an indigenous woman?",0
"This professor used class time for unneeded things. She was not helpful at all when students asked questions and graded unfairly. I would not recommend taking her, at all.",0
Easy class but you are 100% on your own. She never responded to any of my emails or phone calls. I even emailed the administrator trying to get ahold of her. She sets up her online class with automatic test results and does nothing else.,0
"Very confusing professor. I have extensive musical experience and even I get confused. Does not teach how to read music, although it is not a prerequisite for the class but is necessary for success. I do not reccommend taking her.",0
"DO NOT TAKE COURSES WITH PROFESSOR RYNER! He is inconsistent in his grading, very vague in his assignments, and overall very boring. He expects you to be an expert on the subject matter beforehand. He will take points off for extremely minor grammar mistakes, while filling his feedback with typos. Terrible instructor!",0
"Tough class for sure! He is straight forward and comes off as intimidating, but once you get his personality then it isn't so bad . ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS. He wants you to ask questions and to interact. STUDY at least 4 hours a day and have A&P be your priority class for sure.",1
"Highly recommend for STAT 305. Weekly homework that isn't too bad. Gives out example quizzes that are very similar to the actual quiz. I really enjoy his voice during lecture, very clear and he always seems like he's in a good mood.",1
"The homework, you will need to fix his spelling errors. Whilst the homework assigned is long, the homework is easy. However you may completely understand the topics being tested yet be cruelly graded.(the general layout of class is efficient and he gives great lectures) No response ->emails, takes too long to open Dropbox too",0
Awful this man is a terrible teacher. He acts like his students in an intro class are CPAs and know what they are doing. I will be lucky if I make it out of his class alive. If you get this man change out of his classssssss please save yourself,0
great class very easy!! Reconmend for Comp. Sci. 201,1
"Not terrible but not good either. The one good thing is that he curves your final grade at the end of the semester. His exams are brutal, but they're mostly based on the homework, not the slides. Very nice person, but too laid back... except for his exams. Lectures are pointless. He just reads from the slides.",0
"Une vrai Joke, y connait meme pas sa matiere.",0
the man knows a lot about the ocean but his lectures are as boring as watching paint dry. His knowledge of technology is terrible and usually put the opposite of what he says will be on the exam. the funniest thing about him was that he put his office hours around the same time as the class we had. Nice guy but you can tell he doesn't want to teach,0
"Run far away! Although Dr. Simerka is incredibly intelligent, she's very impersonal and her manner can seem very snobbish. This class was really not a great choice. The material is dry and class discussion can also be dry. Incredibly harsh grader, but also good because she expects you to work to your utmost potential.",0
Throughout this class I questioned if Dr Lee really knows what he is talking about? Maybe things are lost in translation but content he is teach is just plain wrong.,0
"Professor Calkins is an AMAZING professor. She is very caring for her students and everything she does throughout the semester is geared towards one big final paper. I'm an Engineering major, so personally, this class was EXTREMELY work heavy. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU AREN'T WILLING TO INVEST TIME ON IT. YOU WILL FAIL IF YOU DON'T.",1
GOOD TEACHER,1
He is a nice guy but the lectures are extremely boring and don't pertain to the material covered. He will get sidetracked and talk about something irrelevant for a half hour. The tests would have been really hard however he puts up previous tests on blackboard that end up being the exact questions on the exams. You just have to memorize the answers,0
"Great professor! 100% recommended! I learn a lot during this class. Do the discussion board assignment early, and try to write more. The extra credit will boost your grade a lot (even from B to A).",1
"Subject is easy but his tests and labs are made to make you do poorly.  If you read his notes and know how to deal with multiple choice, you should do well.  Lectures are boring and uses Microsoft Word.  No one sane would use that to show lecture slides.  And his multiple choice test are like -> look below.",0
I enjoyed her class! She really wants you to understand the material. He tests are much harder than her quizzes but overall a good class. She is also very accessible outside of class.,1
He makes students life hard; very egotistical and rude.,0
"Mrs. Linder is super understanding, she knows that we have other classes to worry about so she understands if we have a lot of other work going on. She is super helpful and is always available if you need help. She responds to emails pretty quickly. I definitely recommend her because she is an amazing professor. Textbook required but barely used.",1
"When I signed up for AMH2020 with Dr Leflouria, I did not expect to be taking History of American Slavery ,as Dr Leflouria focuses completely on slavery as the topic of the class. I enjoyed learning about the significance it had in our country's past & how it was dealt with. A lot of reading, some tests and a Research Paper. Pretty decent overall ",1
"He knows his stuff and is nice! If you don't have interest in roman archeology, though, it may be a bit boring... Exams are not cumulative and just make sure you study in advance so you don't have to cram a bunch of facts and images. Don't really have to do readings, all exam material is straight from lecture (so to do well, go to lecture)",1
Best Professor ever. I love this guy. anything you need he's there and if you reach out to him he will help you get an internship. awesome guy. can't wait to take him again.,1
Goes through slides way too fast for those of us that don't think in math. Comes across arrogant - isn't approachable. Doesn't triangulate book's explanation (especially at the end of the course when he's the author). Expects you to learn software ~and~ scripting/formatting software on your own WHILE learning the actual course.,0
"It seems like a lot of work but its really not. There is an online quiz for every chapter which makes up a lot of points for the class. One presentation, and one group book. Gives amazing feedback that will help you succeed and pass the class. I wish I could take more classes with Heather!",1
Mr. Boyle is a really hot guy although i wish he would lighten up. Sucks that hes already married.,1
"Nice and semi entertaining. BUT, she is very difficult and gives hard quizzes and exams. She always says she will never do an easy quiz. If all you're taking few hours, you'll be fine. But I would not recommend taking her class unless you can put time into it. If I could do it over, I would have picked someone else. If you take her, study a lot.",0
"I had Sander for Bio 108 lab. Extremely tough grader and not clear on material. She is not very clear on feedback. While she is a very nice person (I liked her personally but not professionally) I would not have her as a lab instructor again. On a positive note, she was very willing to help during non-test labs.",0
Professor Neva knott has time and time again has shown her inability to teach by not supporting her student when they excelled in something they previously struggled with. When you ever asked for her help she only responded with not only a rude manner but also more confusing then the prompt she gives. Do not take her class if you ever need help.,0
"If you can avoid her, do it. The worst professor I have ever had. If you have her I recommend dropping the class if you can. I have no understanding why she is still teaching.",0
There are a lot of lab reports due and very little guidance as to how to do them and what he expects. A lot of the material is based off of his lectures not really a lot of pictures to help really understand the concept of what is going on in that part of the body system. No HW except for lab reports but you have to read read read to understand.,1
"He gives way too much work for his class, is a very hard grader, gave two midterms, ended up with a crappy grade. Equivalent effort would have resulted in passing two other courses with an A+.",0
"Just a few notes: On ""Five and Apply"" papers, follow his example EXACTLY, as if it's a template. Seriously. Even if he says it's an ""anonymous"" discussion, use your name. He won't give you credit for the assignment if your name is not attached. Follow his directions EXACTLY and you should get a good grade. No late work!",1
Melissa is an excellent teacher.  She explains exactly what she wants and you can get a strong A if you do it.  I was NOT looking forward to the class before the semester started and now I'd LOVE to take her for another class!  She made public speaking much more comfortable!,1
Great and interesting professor.,1
I wish there was another CS320 prof because he is the worst. I'm not even being salty or joking when I say he is a tough grader and doesn't teach that well. This class was a living nightmare with no help at all and the worst way to grade. I got 0's for the smallest mistakes and tests were just ridiculous levels of time and difficulty. Worst prof.,0
"His classes are very informative and interactive. Unless you have the time to really stick to the text book and lectures, you'll have a really hard time in his class. He is a really hard marker and has very specific expectations for his assignments. Be prepared to receive lower marks than you expected. I would not take a class with him again.",0
"Her lectures are not as detailed as the book but discussion does help with the material. There were 4 HWS, very manageable and 1 programming assignment. Studying the lecture slides & HWS was sufficient to do well on the final and midterm. Pop quizzes that can only help your grade. Overall, very nice teacher!",1
"This class is chill because of Shapiro and fun because you get to know everyone in your class. Assignments are fairly simple- such as attending a religious ceremony, interviewing an immigrant, or  visiting a foreign restaurant. Lots of reading (but no need to read it all) and several papers. Overall, a fresh class  that's worth taking.",1
Really nice guy who really just wants to have a debate. Come to class and you'll get a good grade,1
"Class is easy, but she is unhelpful and sometimes even rude when i try to talk to her outside of class or ask for help. She picks favorites, and makes assumptions about students. She also spend all of class rambling about her son.",0
"Candida is an absolutely amazing teacher.  You get one point a day for saying something.  It doesn't have to be much.  She respects you and understands you are busy.  Very inspirational class, changed my viewpoint.  Candida is great, the course is great, the interaction is best!   Not much reading, you should just go to class!",1
She takes forever to grade your essays and work. does not respond to emails in a timely manner. I would not recommend her class at all.,0
"I took him for both 301 and 311 and it really is a self taught class to a point. His teaching occurs when he goes over the HW in class. If you don't understand, just speak up and he will explain it until you get it. His anecdotes about his history in the business make the class very entertaining. Good class to take.",1
"Very brash and unapologetic dude. Office hours are practically non-existent because he's adjunct. Physics is hard, but he puts in a lot of work to try to help students really understand the concepts instead of just the underlying math.",1
I LOVE DHAVAN.  MY FAVORITE PROFESSOR IN DEPARTMENT AND ONE OF MY FAVORITES IN THE UNIVERSITY.  LECTURES ARE REALLY ORGANIZED AND HE POSTS STUFF IN ADVANCE (USUALLY).  TESTS ARE FAIR.  HE IS AWESOME,1
"Disorganized; no review for tests unless you continuously plead.  Barely used my lab manual; get ready to do alot of self study because teaching is not his strong suit although he is knows his stuff.  And yes, he yells at students and caused alot of anxiety among students in class.",0
Tons of busy work for homework. Not very understanding about late work. Boring class activities,0
This class was a class that started halfway through the spring semester . It started the week the covid-19 pandemic started so we never met in person. She was NOT clear on due dates in emails she sent and whenever I emailed questions there was a rude tone behind the response I got. She seems pleasant but its all an act. Dont take her class.,0
"Psy216 was not what I was expecting, long boring lectures consisting of slides and that's all. I know why students are acting like millenials when the teacher just reads from her slides and doesn't do much more but expect you to know the material she makes so mundane. I took this class expecting a teacher not a robot. I give this class B. Boring",1
"Very unclear on expectations and takes forever to grade things. By the time she tells you that you did something incorrectly, you've already turned 2 other assignments in. Acts in person like she is laid back and an easy going instructor but she's not. She's very picky and will pick you apart.",0
"Fun guy to talk to! Classes, you actually gotta study. Pop test every now and then and a lot of papers due!! Enjoy!",1
"Absolutely awful! Was extremely disorganized and appeared confused by the material when questioned about it in class. Very dry to listen too, as well likes to say the word 'um' or 'uh' several times in a sentence. Two assignments were easy, however, her exam is over email which makes me nervous as she appears to have no skill with technology.",0
"One of the most humorous and interesting people I have met at ECC. His test material comes right out of the notes. As for a lecturer, he can get a little dry when talking about music, but is creative, charismatic and spontaneous enough to keep you involved. Overall: great teacher, great person.",1
This teacher is one of the worst I've ever had. She bases her class on personal opinion (about abortion being wrong and the likes) and you don't learn any sociology. She goes on about not being politically correct. And  her tests are like 60 questions of stuff she didn't teach. Everyone saying she's great has to be white and have the same opinions.,0
"Took him this past fall semester, no pop quizzes, no open book tests. Test are 2 questions, but thats all you really have time for tbh. Equation sheet allowed. There's homework, but only for practice because it's not graded. Hands out his notes which is helpful so we can focus on the lecture better. This is a tough class in itself, tough material.",1
She prefers women over men. She is very moody. I bet all these good comments were made by women in her class.,0
"Class is so pointless, all you do is talk about the book he wrote. Did well in the class but would never take him again. He is creepy....just look at his picture.",0
Gives a lot of information to learn but her exams are extremely fair.,1
Je ne sais pas pourquoi ce prof enseingne encore. il est vraiment sans compétance aucune... oh qu'il est médiocre ce type ....,0
"Unclear, doesn't explain what he wants, then gets angry after the fact, not very helpful, seems disinterested in seeing his students succeed. Misses classes. All over the place in lectures, goes off on tangents. Biased with marking. Very knowledgeable, just not a good teacher.",0
Steve is really enthusiastic about his subject but doesn't always do a good job of explaining. He will throw problems up on the board and go through them but doesn't really go into detail enough to grasp it. He makes a lot of little mistakes sometimes so you have to watch to catch him or he will stare at the board in confusion for 5+ minutes.,1
Probably the worst experience I have ever had with a professor. I got an A in his class but still i would not suggest taking him. The amount of material you have to teach yourself is ridiculous as he chooses not to teach the material necessary on the tests. He comes off as rude and unprofessional to those who don't agree with his personal views.,0
Professor Wellborn is very passionate about history and he wants you to understand it. His lectures are amazing and entertaining. I highly recommend taking his class as he is a very passionate professor and cares for his students.,1
"Aight so Idk if other bio curriculum has the poster project, but it was pretty time consuming especially near the end of the semester with other finals. There are 3 exams, 1 final. There should be a 4th exam instead of that poster project imo. 6 quizzes with lowest one dropped. Bio MCQ are always tricky so go to her office hrs to review em. Gluck",1
"Extremely student-friendly & helpful, always wants students to understand concepts. Replies to emails all the time & very approachable during office hours. posted previous years' exams to help prepare better. cares about his students, explains difficult concepts with models.",1
Comes off as extremely arrogant during lecture. decent teacher but writes hard as hell tests. doesn't curve even though the course average was failing. should not be teaching intro.,1
"If you are taking PHIL 1010 this is the professor you want. There is a reason a majority of his classes finish with A's. You must ALWAYS come to class, do the online discussions (NO ESSAYS) and you will pass with flying colors. Great lectures and prepares you very well for his tests. I thought i would hate this class but i really enjoyed it.",1
"Sometimes kind of dry, but actually found some lecture pretty interesting. He is a stickler for attendance. Also, only one online final at the end. Would take him again",1
"Dr. Kenzig provides feedback on assignments, but it is vague and not helpful. The amount of work each week is overwhelming, beware if you work full time. I would not take another class with this professor as she is a lazy professor with a completely chaotic and unorganized course structure. 10/10 DO NOT recommend.",0
"Sam is honestly one of the coolest professors I've had. However, he does not use Powerpoint slides so you need to jot down notes during lecture + pay EXTRA attention because your notes will be your only reference. Lectures are discussion-based so you're free to interrupt and ask Qs. Homework are really helpful, exams are alright. Take the class!!",1
On the first day he said half the class would drop by the middle of the term.. he was right. If he knows half will drop he should make a change so that doesn't happen. Not a good teacher and wouldn't recommend!,0
"Honestly, this class was one of the most enjoyable, easy classes I have taken. I am so glad I found this ""Social Media"" class. It only lasts half a semester and def an easy  A if you do the work. Don't get lazy as it's not much work! Easiest A if you do the work. Also, very nice person in general.  I would take him again if I could!",1
"3 tests-Drops the lowest, a final and attendance. SHOW UP FOR THIS CLASS. 5 random attendance days. He gives you the answers to the exams so you don't need to pay attention or study, just memorize them before and you will pass. Final is a mix of all 3 review sheets so memorize all three and you will do extremely well. Literally a Study Hall. Easy A",1
"Upper level literature course on topic of ""the journey""--Waxler thinks life is a journey and literature is, too. Could be he's right. Risky business anyway. I dig it!",1
If you read you will pass.,1
EXCELLENT!,1
Professor Guzzone is easily one of the best professors Pace has to offer.  I always had an interest and love for music but he truly made my love for music sky rocket.  I started to appreciate different styles of music and the cultures which individuals lived in.  Thank you Professor Guzzone!,1
"I love psychology with a passion but this has been by far the worst class I have ever taken. She is a sweet women but my goodness! I never even knew what my grades were because nothing was graded till the end of the semester, by that point I couldn't fix my errors on the next assignments. This was also a very unorganized.",0
"this guy speaks in a sign language.although helpfull personally but tests are so hard, going to class meaningless, i would rather jab a fork in my mouth than take any class from him.",0
"Lots of reading, and if you aren't good with structure his online class isn't for you. You have to be super organized in order to take this class, and be prepared to read  A LOT, material is rather hard and it may take you a couple times to read it to understand the material. Lectures are lengthy but make things clear. ",1
"he was a terrible teacher. honestly worst i've ever had. leaves you to teach yourself the course. he would overload you with homework and never even went over it and was always in a bad mood. he told my class, ""guys i could be doing something better than be wasting my time here"" but isn't it your JOB to be here??? definitely do not recommend him!!",0
"Professor Rice makes this lab very difficult. She grades very harshly, and also waits forever to post grades, leaving you in the dark as to how your doing. Professor Rice gives poor feedback on assignments and is not very flexible/understanding.",0
Teaches very boring. Long and unnecessary. Hyprocrite,0
good teacher...everything is very clear and assignments are easy. Really cares for her students,1
"Very unclear instruction for her project. She is NOT ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS on email but talk about other stuff. What she says on the comment is totally different from what she said during the class. She is very tough for grade. If you take her class, you have to be professional to Adobe Dreamweaver, a beginner will not pass her class.",0
"Prof Harding is like a ham and cheese sandwich. Very average. His lectures aren't the best ever, he does allow a bit of discussion to hold your attention. Most of your grade comes from two papers, two tests, and a big project. He grades decently easy, and may allow a chance to look at notes during the test. I would be willing to take him again.",1
"One thing about Dr. Desselle is she takes FOREVER to grade assignments, it's actually pathetic. However the work itself is not too complicated if you actually study like a college student and participate in class. My advice is too take note to complete and turn in every assignment on time. Study and turn in everything, you'll be fine!",0
"Professor Trombley lays her class out clearly. She consistently took the content from that week and related it to real life through discussion topics (which have several options to choose from). The weekly quizzes are easy IF you do the readings, practice tests, and read modules. This class is relatively low stress & I learned a lot.",1
WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD! She took forever to put the syllabus online. We were in week three and she still didn't have it up until the day of our second lecture. She expects you to read the book to find out all of the information you need. If you ask her a question she is going to tell you to look in her book. She expects you to self teach.,0
"If you want to cover an entire chapter in an hour and a half class period and be quizzed over the material almost every single class, she's the teacher for you. She sits at the front of the class and lectures with a monotone voice so it's hard to pay attention. Since she covers an entire chapter in one class, it's hard to catch up if you fall back.",0
"Mrs. Abraham was as awesome teacher! She provides the readings for the semester so you don't have to buy books. She gives good feedback, only a couple projects, 2 papers and one big project due at the end of the semester as your ""final"", but it was easy. Definitely recommend her!",1
Very knowledgeable professor. He knows his stuff. Only problem is that he goes too fast when showing his slides. His exams are half the quiz and half class notes. Very hard class. Must be willing to memorize a lot of information.,0
"I took this class online and he had no idea how to use the technology. We went through an entire lecture without being able to see his screen. His exams are extremely difficult and he had to end up curving the entire class. He might be different in a traditional course, but I would never take him online again.",0
"I'm not sure about the course IRL but online it was terrible. The entire course was automated (all assignments, quizzes, and lectures were uploaded from the start) and the only way we could contact our teacher was through email. Lectures were missing information so the class basically came down to reading the textbook and then doing the quizzes",0
"Course content was interesting, but she constantly told us she was ""spoon feeding"" us, that we were lazy, not genuine and would wouldnt go anywhere in life with our work ethic. Also compared us to chinese students all the time. Would have preferred she stuck to the course material instead of constant lectures about how much we suck.",0
Shes a hard grader. You should go to class regularly and listen to the lectures and pay attention. Dont fall asleep in her class. Do all assignments. No extra credit. Go to office hours and get help.,1
"Favorite Teacher by far, super easy to learn from and will help you with anything.  Highly recommend taking her class",1
It wasn't too bad. The class was very similar to my high school chemistry class but taught a little faster and a little more in depth. The accent wasn't too bad to get used to.,1
Great instructor! Will review a problem until you get it. Has an accent but not difficult to understand.,1
"If you're taking this class to fill a core, think again. Provost is a geniunely nice guy, now that we got that out of the way. Multiple questions assigned every class (Marked very hard), a 10 page paper (9 sources needed), and get ready to be serenaded by his voice considering all he does is lecture all class #yawn. This class is reading heavy!!!!!",0
"Even on Spring Break, Dr. Lafferty is available. She has been very friendly, clear, fair, and gives feedback and her opinion often. She incorporates her personal life regarding her education; I don't think it's too much, I think she is trying to relate to the students she can't connect with in person. No tests, 3 papers and several discussions.  ",1
"I thought that the class was okay. Not super interesting, but not super hard either. Dave Barker is very helpful and he is willing to give personal help to his students when they need it.",1
"Great teacher and a fairly fun class. A lot of listening to music and learning a liitle about it. Unlikely to be anything you recognize or would listen to on a daily basis. Over all though, super easy class.",1
"Showed up late to almost every class, likes to hear himself talk and tends to ramble. Exams were easy as long as you studied and did the guide he gives you, show up for attendance points.",0
Honestly this wasn't a bad professor at all. She does not follow the syllabus because she asks the students their opinions on when tests/homework should be due. She teaches quickly but is open for questions and use the chem extra help center!,1
"She's amazing and very interesting to listen to. She is very passionate about the work she assigns and picks books that almost anyone could enjoy. I really don't like reading too much, but she managed to make it interesting!",1
Do not take this class,0
"Dr. Pittman is an amazing professor. She is really caring and tries her best to make sure you understand. She is very accessible outside of class and answers emails timely. The class is well organized and you will know all of your due dates at the beginning of the semester. Additionally, she grades fairly and gives good feedback.",1
"Very boring and long lectures, gives homework that is not interesting at all and makes you not want to draw. doesnt ever give As on homework",0
"Clawson is really caring and interested in his students so it's an easy class to pass, although there is A LOT of reading which is important to quizzes (a pretty big part of your grade) and the final exam. There's a big paper but its very doable and Dan is very easy to work with. Lectures get a bit tedious but can be though provoking",1
"I didn't really enjoy Peter as a teacher. He was super unorganized and wasn't willing to help me outside of class. One time it took him 3 weeks to grade our tests... 3 weeks!! (Mind you, he only teachers one class.) I was embarrassed to be one of his students.",0
"Took him during the summer. His class was an easy A, but it it was also important to participate. We did two papers, two speeches (one group), and had a midterm and final. The questions come straight from the review. He uses powerpoints for lecture. Textbook wasn't a must if you want get by. He was funny and laid back.",1
"great teacher, so nice, brought us food, totally understands the subject bc he is in many small businesses himself..pretty hot",1
"This class is relatively easy, but it is frustrating and annoying. The program used and format of the class is completely inefficient and not at all user-friendly.  Rankin is not helpful and cannot even do the activities herself many times. Her teaching is immature and ineffective. I would suggest finding a better professor for this class.",0
"Dr. A is a very nice man and I have taken several of his classes but, unfortunately, his teaching style does not suit me.  He explains math with words instead of examples, which is difficult for me and many others. This comment is coming from someone who earned A's in the entire Calculus series.  Avoid his classes if you are a visual learner.",0
"Excellent Teacher! Knowledgable, easily approachable with a awesome sense of humor. Gives you every possible opportunity to pass. Honestly, you'd have to be a lazy dolt to fail.",1
"Oh boy, this was not what I expected when I signed up for his class. I barely passed this class. Its true, he didnt teach and he didnt prepare us for the longest and worst exam of of life. Pure hell with him. At the end he let us retake exams and that helped me pass but I wouldnt ever take this again. F ++++ for his teaching! Worst professor!",0
Professor C is a caring person. his grading criteria is clear and he is very understanding. He is extremley nice and calm and he makes sure he goes over the lesson for you to understand. He also gives extra credit opportunities! I love Professor C!!,1
"Being a psychology major, I had taken her previously last year (first class on campus) and have noticed a significant difference in her demeanor and teaching rapport. Communication with her is rare at best and instructions on assignments are susceptible to changing weekly. Only recommend to those with lots of open time for studying.",0
She is awesome! Had her this year for Trauma and Abuse and she did a fantastic job teaching! She does soo much outside of school and still manages to be on top of stuff. Hope to get her again before I graduate :),1
"He has an accent, but easy to understand.  He has a good sense of humor and tries to answer questions. He had to cover a lot of material so recommends that you get a tutor if you cannot understand beyond the classroom.  He does give opportunity to go over HW questions on following week. Very fair teacher. Don't miss class - you'll miss a lot!",0
"Il n'explique pas bien, survole la matière, nuit plus qu'il aide. À éviter.",0
Very rough professor. Not very understanding to personal issues that may impact class. Do not take,0
"He is a very clear lecturer and if you follow his advice, it will greatly improve your professional writing. Sometimes the lectures get a little dull, but pay attention because you do learn useful things. He's truly nice and cares about students' success. If you put in the work, you'll get a good grade.",1
"DO NOT TAKE HIM! I am warning you!!! He is the worst... seriously... save yourself, your GPA, your money, and your time!!!!!!!",0
"I had to take this class for one of my cores, and I hated it. Random pop quizzes on content, we barley covered the final and midterm is a joke, and his lectures are lackluster, and he is passive aggressive. This class would be remotely interesting if it was not from this professor. He also sucks at answering emails and is not the most understanding",0
"She's alright. You will have a quiz every lecture on the assigned reading assignment and the exams are decent, but sometimes the prompts are weird.",1
"STAT 212 is the absolute worst class I've ever taken at UVA.  The way the class is run is terrible... it seems as if Ted Chang and his TA's WANT you to fail.  Tests are extremely difficult and nothing at all like the homework.  The only reason I took this was for my Econ major.  For an intro course, it's unnecessarily painful.",0
test R open book but u do need to study they R not really that easy! but hw counts 150pts so that helps----- & he is supper hot & has great HAIR! but he is married got married spring break 2005 so that sucks,1
This Professor is very helpful.You have to read the chapters and do the worksheets he gives out.Exams are easy and he reviews with you before the exam what other prof.does that?You'll love him!If you don't pass something is wrong with you not with him. Take him you'll learn a lot!,1
Unorganized and scattered during lectures. Uninteresting but the class is easy. A few short papers and easy online quizzes,0
"Needs to get a grip, he can deride his students when they don't understand a subject immediately. Goes off on irrelevant tangents, wasting our time. Needs to use better short forms for words he writes on the board.",0
"The class is mostly lectures, but she does a good job keeping it interesting. It is fast-paced and difficult to keep up with sometimes. There are 4 exams, 4 books, and a few other assignments. Don't buy the textbook, just go to class. Never used the textbook and was fine. Definitely show up to class or else the material will be hard to understand",1
"Do yourself a favor: don't take this class. If you need honors credit, take psychology. He is so bad that he told us that ratemyprofessor is full of students that failed the class and are illiterate. I obviously didn't fail and he was bad enough that I needed to let anyone that is considering his class know that they need to reconsider.",0
Could not even ask questions because she talked the entire class period. If you tried to ask something she would shush you. Infamous for going on tangents that do not even relate to the material. She crammed 6 assignments in the end of the semester because she used up all the time talking about irrelevant topics. I would not recommend taking her. ,0
"Professor Alemayhu is fair, but sometimes you mostly have to ask him to explain assignments clearly. He does care and wants everyone to pass his class, just do the lab exercises and you will do well.",1
Took Ms. Wells for math 115. She's an amazing instructor. Will taking her for Statistics in the fall. Recommend her to everybody. She explains well and has lots of patience.,1
Terrible class. You won't learn much.   Teacher is not all together.,0
"if i had to guess, the worst physics professor at this school",0
"Thought having an online class the professor wouldn't matter b/c you teach yourself, but I have never had a more unclear, rude, demeaning professor in my life. Unclear grading along with the worst feedback and no room to do better unless you harass her with emails asking what you did wrong and how to improve and she replies so nasty 5 days later.",0
"I would NOT recommend taking 122A with her. She's super confusing, unclear at times, and most of the time messes up the problem she's doing on the board. She's inconsistent w/ her grading, you could get the same answer on your paper as someone else and she'll mark you down for stupid reasons. She also gets off topic, and makes class hard to follow.",0
"She obviously did not want to be teaching the course, her attitude to the students was dripping of condescension and a lack of respect.  The material was interesting but presented slowly and the class was often unbearingly boring.",0
"Microeconomics. Paid approximately $40 for his homework program. Generously curves the first 2 exams. NOT the final. Homework is very simple. Exams are essentially homework questions so truly understand the homework. Sign-in sheet is passed around but once you sign, you can go w/o any consequences. Book is NECESSARY. Cheap. approx $10",1
"She knows her stuff...that's for sure. However, classes and discussions were very dry and dead. I sort of didnt know what I was doing there after a while.",1
"The only way to not pass this class is if you don't do the work. The lectures are laid out and she goes through them thoroughly with opportunity for questions. She responds promptly to emails and gives feedback. There are group projects involved, but again just do the work. She is very helpful.",1
"Miranda is the worst teacher I have ever had. She is rude when asked questions, likely because she doesn't know the answer herself. Her slides are useless and incorrect (noticed an error in her slides and she told us to assume they were wrong). The only thing you will learn from this class is how to resent her and how neat she thinks diatoms are.",0
"Horrible professor. Great about lecture and tips. Terrible at testing material, unclear on verbal instructions, and doesn't like lots of questions from students. Always advise to refer back to lectures and figure out the problem while I struggle. I wouldn't take her again. Never again! It hurts!",0
I am currently taking him for Corporate Finance. He keeps the class interesting and tries to teach you real life situations instead of just learning from the textbook. Good Professor in my opinion.,1
THEE ABSOLUTE WORST TEACHER ALIVE. NEVER TAKE HIM. WAY TOO QUICK. DID NOT LEARN ONE SINGLE THING FROM HIM.,0
One of the nicest professors I've had. The class is not that hard. If you just show up and listen to the lectures it will make the test really easy. Had a group project but was not that bad. I ended up with a 3.7 and used sparknote for the last half of the semester,1

"He is an extremely harsh grader, gives unclear instructions, and penalizes you if your work doesn't reflect his personal preferences. I took the class when we first started using Zoom, and still received my worst grade. Heartless & apathetic. Get's a power trip over his ability to give students poor grades. It's sad he doesn't want you to succeed.",0
"He is a nice guy, but he really sucks at teaching. On the study guide, he only gives us the names of artwork and thats all. He talks a lot, and introduces the topic in a really boring way. Its very difficult to study for his exams. He thinks that everyone likes art as much as he does. Overall, not a good professor, and I dont recommend him.",0
"He's a really nice, generous and helpful guy. Makes the occasional joke in class. Goes through material somewhat quickly and isn't always clear in answering questions. Review session before final hurt more than it helped. Overall a good class and a great guy.",1
Taking 351 with Stewart was amazing. The class is lecture heavy but he's hilarious and easily accessible outside of class. He generally doesn't use powerpoint so the notes you take are your lifeline but he answers questions during and after class and through email. So glad I chose him for my advisor. He also knows a lot about chem and bio,1
Great course. Very knowledgable professor.,1
This class is very difficult.The work never ends. We never get out of class early.Think twice about taking this.,0
"The class is really easy, but you kind of have to teach yourself.  He is confusing in lecture and he even confuses himself most times.  If you ask for help on a question he either does it without much explanation, or he gets it wrong and another student has to complete it for him.  I think he is very smart, but isn't the best teacher.  ",0
"He live streams and records his lectures so you don't have to attend in person. He has good examples and I had a good understanding of the material. Seemed like he had other priorities this semester. Didn't send out ANY grades for our labs/hw. Often canceled class or said ""online class today"" like 3-4 hrs before class and was late a lot too, idk",1
"Stay FAR away from this teacher/class unless you are 200% dedicated. 40+ pages to read, 3 tests, 3 quizzes, a 30 minute video & discussion board EVERY WEEK. This was the hardest class I have ever taken and ended up having to drop it. May have been easier if this was the ONLY class I was taking that semester.",0
"Emily Bauman is and was one of the best Literature/Writing teachers I've encountered. She helped me a lot in terms of bravery in writing and always gave the most rigorous, close criticism.",1
Class is easy enough. Lectures are clear. Do the work and you'll be fine.,1
"Such an easy class!!! Wow, if you take this professor, you definitely won't regret it. No homework, you can find the answers online for the 3 quizzes he gives, and that's pretty much it! No midterm or final, only 1 group assignment which is easy too. You can sign the attendance and just leave later class. Definitely a good pick not gonna lie.",1
"Lectures consist of ""learning"" terms and specific pieces which are just the quiz answers. No in depth understanding or outside example. Koehler rambles incoherently every single lecture as others have noted. Talks for mere minutes at a time about the class subject, elsewhere rants about unrelated and milquetoast conspiracies about society.",0
"Very nice indeed, plus the class is pretty interesting.",1
"-Great, entertaining lectures -very caring -professor brings scantrons for his class",1
The book is mandatory and youll have to lean heavily on it in order to study for lab practicals. He will come around and help; if you ask. If possible come In outside of lab to look at your cat. Make sure you know how to correctly spell everything. Always work on something during lab(its 4 hrs) hell get upset if you arent doing anything.,1
"he is a great prof he knows how to keep me awake in class, he is so hip and up to the times, sometimes more than me!!!! i would totally say take all his classes!!!!",1
"The course was reading-intensive, but the stories all contributed to the course topic. Professor Tulin is willing to provide clarity about the readings during the lectures and wants students to give their input on the material and class structure. The group projects and discussion posts require students to go in-depth to get full points.",1
"Best professor I've ever had while at UNCC, you can tell she actually cares about her students. I highly recommend taking any class she offers! Class was only held when it was needed and the days we did attend a class she made it fun and easy. She is also the most reasonable professor I've ever had.",1
"Highly recommended professor. Makes an effort to have you connect to the class and material. He's very knowledgeable on the material and interested. Not one of these robot professors who just reads off powerpoints. Key to succeed: Review the class material prior to class, go to class and participate, show up for reviews and ask away.",1
"very energetic teaching that will never leave you bored, easy/understandable explanations and examples.",1
"Don't even get me started on this dude. Went into the class with 6 years of studying French and after it, I dropped my french minor. Took him on Tues, and Thurs and don't expect anything less then 2-3 hours of homework per class period. Tests are ea breeze but good luck getting ANYTHING above a B on each homework. don't take. Seriously...",0
She really teaches you to design and pushed your natural creativity. It is a shame many students try and take advantage of her supportive and kind nature. She doesn't let them get away with it thought! A gem to MU.,1
he's a nice guy but he disarms you with his kindness then half way though the quarter you realize your doing way too much unnecessary work to justify for an English 101 class. Attendance is graded and you will be test on his lectures on the finals. You will turn everything on canvas & online quizzes are taken in class. he's very loud speaker,0
Professor Egan is definitely a great professor. The class is interesting and very simple. He definitely wants you to earn an A.,1
"I took his class in Spring semester . Just want to share my opinion for who want to take this class. If English is your second language and you are not VERY GOOD at Enlgish, want to get A with ENG1302, DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS. I had D grade with his class EVEN I finished all the essays in class and I have to take this class again.",0
"One of the most intelligent professors I've ever had, however, I would not recommend taking him. He plays favorites and if you are not one of them, expect a final grade that doesn't  match your work. Does not offer any help and expects you to accept his interpretations as truth- anything else is incorrect. Don't take him if you can help it.",0
Good. Helped me with my essay,1
Homework every class containing about 20 questions. Each assignment takes about an hour to complete. Couldn't fully understand his demos.,0
Professor Zimmerman is not doing well in the virtual world. She doesnt post assignments when she says she will and gives feedback on assignments after they are due. She forgot to give my class a midterm so suddenly made the final worth 40 percent. On the final she included content she never taught and posted a ppt so we could teach ourselves.,0
The best professor i've ever had. Truly a caring and respectful person.  He's also a professor that you can tell is actually very intelligent (unlike many),1
This class was horrible. She grades on however she wants and doesn't give back any comments. Her scantron tests are not even covered in the book.,0
You are never going to know your grades.,1
Workload is absurd. Was seemingly shocked that COVID19 affected students' abilities to complete assignments. Waited until April 12 to make course adjustments. Expects students to prioritize her class above all else but hasn't graded papers from week 3. Remember that English teacher in high school you couldn't stand? She's back and better than ever,0
"She's very hard, but she does have a heart if you talk to her she will bend over backwards to help you. I wish she lectured using words we could understand. It sounded more foreign than the book... especially because I haven't taken a college bio before. I felt like I didn't learn anything because of that. Tests are hard too.",1
"Don't expect to know your grade ever. He is usually all over the the place and always cancels class. He grunts a lot too. But if you are struggling, he will help you, but only if you ask him for it. He gives a lot of extra credit though.",0
Shes cool,1
"Barbara Sanders is a very kind person, however I did find her to be quite intimidating at first so it was hard to ask questions. The content of this lab is very difficult but I found Sanders to be a generous marker when it came to assignments as she gave out partial marks when appropriate",1
"very good math professor, he wants us to learn so much about math proofs in each class, so it's really hard to follow and absorb the material sometimes, since it's also too abstract.  Professor is prefect, the only thing is that I am not smart/hardworking  enough to keep pace. But if you want to learn pure math, that's the correct man to follow. ",1
She's not even a business teacher!,0
"She doesnt teach the material in class, instead she makes you watch videos at home at teach yourself. Videos have bad audio and do a poor job of teaching the material. Exams were long and difficult, good luck finishing them on time. If you use a different method than the one from the videos, she docks tons of points and accuses you of cheating.",0
"The materials that she chose for the class were interesting, but she rarely  gave me any meaningful feedback.  Her grading criteria on major assignments was confusing. Plus, she was not super nice when responding to my questions.  I would recommend buying the textbooks via kindle.  Also, ask a classmate first if you have a question.",0
She is horrible. She did not teach anything in this production. It was mostly a play that was for her tribute to her heritage. We did not learn acting or technical things. We were used for her name and project. But in the end she was blaming us for everything. Run away from this person.,0
"I think hes a good professor, and probably way better in person. He tried his best but the course just wasnt structured well, and the grading criteria was practically non-existent. Kind of difficult to figure out what hes looking for.. two assignments, midterm & final essay. Answer a series of questions (5) about 1/2-2 pg each.",1
He is a very nice professor and tries to be fair to everyone! He is one of the most responsible professors I've met and the topics we learn are fun!,1
Our class got a 43% average on the midterm while Alex Crams midterm average was in the 70's .. she doesn't teach you ANYTHING. Midterm exam was horrible.,0
"This dude is awful, has a thick African accent, lacks modern teaching techniques. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS .  Should go back to tutor school. ",0
One of my worst college professors ever. She knows that material herself but can't explain it at all. I wouldn't even recommend this class. You really need extra tutoring and like help from multiple people. She literally only explains things once and will ignore your question is hse doesn't understand it or she has someone else answer it.,0
Prof. Khadka is one of my best in SJCC. He want hes students successful in the subject. I recommend to all who interested in Phys 4A to attend with Him. ,1
"Frequently late to class, rarely responds to emails, tests you over things that aren't covered but doesn't use the book. She requires you to purchase the book even though it's on canvas... We're very behind and continuously get farther behind because she goes off on tangents about her kid or husband. DO NOT take",0
I think that the best way to describe this professor is mediocre. I felt that he was not the best at lecturing and being clear about what we needed to know. He kind of rushes through topics and can be difficult to understand. One AWESOME thing that he does though: index card during test and good test reviews! Also he takes attendance.,0
No Comments,0
Stubborn and unaccommodating professor. Not willing to help students who approach her. Doesn't consider student feedback at all -- 0/10 would not recommend,0
"This lady really makes us do an essay with 3 drafts, I'm not sure about you but that seems very unnecessary. On top of that she makes you do a letter of reflection on your paper to basically repeat what you said in your essay, so you basically gotta sum up your essay in four paragraphs which is so stupid and unnecessary. I DO NOT RECOMMEND>.",0
"Do not take her, take another professor f possible. she does not even teach correctly, it is more of a self learning class",0
Shes a nice teacher but overall very hard. The exams for this class are 50% of your grade!!! which is absurd. All exams are 85 minutes which is not enough time for some people. You have to keep track of 3 websites for her class.,1
Wow this guy is bad. Your quizzed at the beginning of every single class about things you had to teach yourself. Then you have to sit there for a lecture filled with tangents and that is never relevant to what you read. 2 people in my class have above a B. 9 have below a C. Find someone else.,0
"Pretty great professor. Likes his subject and gets excited about different aspects of it. Some of the things he get excited about are pretty nerdy, but that just makes him funnier. He tries to push you to understand certain subject matter that he knows you will need in future classes. Always available in person or via E-mail if you need help.",1
"This professor can be hard to understand sometimes. It definitely helps if you have a background in chemistry before taking this class. He randomly takes attendance for a grade. He provides study guides which are a nice prep. Take notes and get help or review the textbook for a better understanding, again background in some chem in HS is helpful!!!",1
"He posts his previous tests online, and he takes his new tests right from there. All his notes are online as well. He goes really fast through the material in class, so it's almost pointless to go. However, the day before exams, he gives you really good hints as to what else is going to be on the exams.",0
Brianna is an excellent teacher. She explains things so everyone can understands and won't move on until you do.  She is willing to answer questions and encourages them. Probably the best math teacher i've ever had in my life.,1
"Team business simulation was fun, but we had members who did not pull weight. Points system he uses does not fairly reflect that. Possible 575, and only 20 reflect team support. Two of us worked tirelessly, and other two got gifted 117 points for our work. Unfair system. Directions on assignments left much to be desired as well.",0
"Not a great teacher, not much learning due to her reading straight from the power points (which were sometimes WRONG). Graded off four tests , lab and a case study. ,but only because most of the class failed. Talked too much about personal life and crocheting. was not patient with students and expressed it.",0
Terri is a very nice lady however this semester I did was not a fan of flipping the classroom teaching method. I had to drop after talking to my counselors. in Will try taking Into to Psych in the spring.,0
"terrible professor ever. Vague criteria, thinks shes a good professor, and ignore students. Let me just say this, DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. YOU WILL REGRET JUST LIKE ME.",0
"Super easy class if you put in the work. I would study like 2 days a week and I was averaging an A on the quizzes. The cool thing is if you maintain an A in the class you don't have to take the final! He's a little dry at times, but its an interesting class. Would take again.",1
Very clear on expectations- allows revisions to get a higher grade- very responsive to emails and provides a lot of help if you need it- is a lot of work if you take over the summer but can be done if you have good time management skills- 4 essays that are 40% of total grade- I definitely recommend Dr. Zbeida!,1
Dr. Mark is the worst professor I have ever had. She grades based on her personal feelings towards you and provides no clarification. There's a group assignment nearly every week. Any positive review on here is either written by herself or a student that she really likes somehow. She gives the most boring videos to watch and it's all horrible.,0
"Barcley is quite focused on experiential learning methodology. His book choices are from the Lean Start-up gurus with a focus on current epistles from Eric Ries and Steve Blank. Absolute enjoyed trip to Chicago for Hyde Park Angels seminar. However, I do not share his love of Apple technology, Android is fine.",1
"I took this class during summer session 1 and I know that there is a ton of information in a short period of time, but this guy did not teach me anything. The entire class was spent doing the questions at the end of the chapter, then him giving us the answers. No explaning of the problems, no teaching of the material. I mainly taught myself.",0
"AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID !!!!! He is like a nightmare! Terrible lectures. And he is really mean to you. He is a Monster. The homework is hard. You spent so much time on it, and you still couldnt get a good grade. Worst Professor Forever. If you dont want to torture yourself, be wise and don't choose his class.",0
I dreaded taking English but Professor Boyles keeps the class engaged and he won't bore you to death. Do the work and participate in class and you'll get an A.,1
"If you have the opportunity definitely take professor bamford. She is so sweet and she's from the UK. Her classes are engaging, some more than others. Our only homework is a short/medium sized reading or participating in discussion boards. She is very understanding and will let you make anything up if you reach out. You can tell she likes her job.",1
"Teaching a course based off of self-help books is a waste of time. Online quiz, online lecture, loads of reading... busy work with a 45 minute presentation to fill class time.  supposed to be a 2+2 credit course but really it is 4+2 for 3 credits.",0
"Rick is a really great teacher, easy marker, but everything is due at the very end of the semester, overall...highly reccomended",1
His class is so boring.  You have to read all these poems he picked out which is boring and write a essay on it. The class is mainly on participation. I got good grades on my papers and still got an C in his class. I only take it if you have to.,0
All I have to say is eh. Its an okay class. If you can remember stuff and like to read then youll pass. Everything is straight from the textbook.,1
"okay whoever said jeri is bad is an idiot. shes not the head of the art department for nothing people. shes compassionate, caring and ALWAYS makes time for people. she helped me get my art program up and running. im so happy MU has her, and shes the head of the department. great professor, great person.",1
"Angela is very sweet and very charismatic. As long as you put effort into your poetry/writing, you should get a good grade in her class. She cares about your process rather than the actual content of your work.",1
Absolutely amazing professor. You can tell he genuinely cares a lot about the success of his students; he holds many review sessions and is always open to help even in the middle of a lecture. His lectures are very easy to understand and actually quite interesting. He is an amazing person and teacher... 10/10 would recommend taking his class!,1
Lots of readings. One of the worst professors I've had at AU. While the readings are interesting there is no deep discussion and you don't get helpful feedback. ,0
"Looking back, i feel like the material for this class was way overcomplicated by Hines' teaching. He went way too fast and messed up more times than I could count while solving problems. I highly recommend going to Johnny Prints and picking up the slides used in class. Get ready to teach yourself this whole course.",0
Professor McDaniel does not make this class interesting nor teaches enough on the material needed for the test.,0
"She doesn't care about individuals. if you ask for help she tells you to go look it up or says ""I've already told you how to do it"". She isn't helpful at all inside or outside the class room.",0
He is a great professor and his classes are very engaging. He is open to communication and understands the issues faced by the students. ,1
lesley is such a cool teacher that is very helpful and encouraging to students.  Her and Brian are great photo instructors.,1
Fantastic! My favorite teacher so far at UB. Nice guy. Very good at keeping students interested. Easy tests. Couldn't ask for better.,1
Great!,1
Kelm really doesn't care if you pass or not all of his lectures are done through online videos and he does not teach in class. He simply goes over questions that students have. He assigns a ton of homework so I recommend only taking him if this class is your main focus.,0
he hates everyone,0
"Dr. MS is a great teacher. He knows how to teach and is very knowledgable. His tests are difficult but they are fair. There is about a 13% curve in his class, but depends on each class. Averages are in the 60s and the final avg was a 72%. Even if you are way below average you will end up with a C. Overall Fun and engaging teacher!",1
"She never follows the rubric. Gave me a 57 out of 130 for ""not developing my thesis enough."" The only reason my SOC 112 class was difficult was because of her. Drop the class and take it with someone else. I was a 4.0 student before her. Now I have a 3.8",0
"Took a condensed class with Mr. Gier. There is a lot of homework, classwork, participation required but that's College for you. Always on time with grading and feedback. Overall, excellent experience with this online class and excellent teaching from this Professor. Advise to take his class.��",1
"David is extreme boring and unorganized. He makes 9am lectures a snooze fest when all he does is read off of the slides.  His assignments have not been modified since 2009 and his required readings are just way too much. Course is great, the prof not so much",0
"This man looooves to waste trees and give the most amount of worksheets. In my opinion, this class is a very easy A, but the material on homework, quizzes, and tests is very inconsistent. He is very scatter-brained and all over the place with his explanations. He's funny and all, but I learned nothing about how to teach kids math",0
Avoid taking him. He failed me. I took Calculus 1. He expect the students should know everything. He just write notes on board and expects students to know everything.,0
"Professor Goldmann is great! Her tests are strictly based off of her lectures, so don't buy the book. Just show up to class and you'll get an A",1
Dr. Salano is an awesome dude and a good teacher. if you do the work your gonna get an A. i got a B but i suck at school. great guy though.,1
"All the projects is listed in the syllabus. She take attendance at the end, so make sure you don't leave the classroom lol.",1
"This lady is supper sweet, but she clearly has nothing else to do than make you so homework. She seems to forget that this is a 100 level course and that we take other classes. She assigns too many readings, projects and essays. Do take her unless you like that.",0
one the best accounting professors! She goes super slow and explains everything nicely. I had a hard time with accounting and she really made it easy for me to understand. If your dreading accounting take this with her compared to the other accounting professors she's a life saver !,1
"Professor has been teaching at Toledo for 55+ years. Great guy with a lot of knowledge. Only set back is that if you ask a question in class, he seems like he gets mad at you for it. Overall a great guy with a lot of knowledge and he knows the material like the back of his hand. Willing to help in office hours.",1
Boring lecture. Don't take when this guy's teaching Astr323.,0
"This is one of the worst professors at GWC. Taking Botany with him and it is SO easy, and not in a good way. He always wastes lecture time consistently by going on random tangents about irrelevant things. There's no organization or structure in this class and he does NOT put students first. Easy A but you will NOT be ready for other majors courses.",0
"I know the bad ratings for Stone; I was in the class with no curve. This is my honest opinion-the class can be passed, even with an A, but don't have any other hard classes because you'll need lots of study time. I didn't get lots of study time, but I studied without believing in a final curve, so I got a C- That curve is not assured, so study.",0
SHE IS TERRRRIBLE!!!!!I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND TAKING HER FOR ENGLISH..EVER!,0
Online course was extremely difficult. Dr. Melendez was not available for any study sessions or help. No video lectures or meeting. He would unlock the week's chapter and you were on your own. Took several days to respond to emails.,0
"Austin is one of the best profs I've ever had...he's incredibly intelligent but makes the material easy to understand.  The midterm was a bit freaky, but he was really fair in marking it.  He's awesome!",1
He is a good professor! His online class is quite easy if you read the assigned chapters.  His book Social Welfare Policy And Social Programs is a very interesting book to read.,1
"He's fine. But his lectures are unclear and he doesn't really know what he is talking about without his notes. He repeats what he says and the tests go along with what he says in class. Don't focus on what the slides say, focus on what he says in class.",1
"Experienced, but sloppy & lazy at teaching. He reads off his many slides. Cuts off student questions and can't answer them clearly. Many errors on tests. Wording of questions are confusing & vague. Likes to be chummy with students. Material is tough. You will have to teach yourself from the textbook and put in A LOT of your own time to do well.",0
Took him for Math 45. You will not pass if you skip class. Each meeting is lecture heavy and he will go through it fast. Make sure to ask questions if you don't get it. Tests are worth a majority of your grade so make sure to study and do study guides.,1
He is a fast teacher and can be difficult to follow in class. He can make simple concepts more complicated than they seem. I had a tutor I met with three times a week and still got consistent Cs and Ds on tests. The quizzes are helpful but his class does not prepare you for his difficult exams.,0
I've had this professor for two different classes and loved both. Go to class and you will easily get an A. There is built in extra credit in every aspect of the class. There are no tests except for the final. Mini quizzes every week but looking through the chapter gets you through them. Take notes when he goes over the quizzes and you are golden.,1
"If you're going to get your students to buy a textbook about Brazil, assign more than 50% of the readings on Brazil, and spend 70% of the lectures time talking about Brazil and remembing all the good times you had in Brazil, DON'T title your course ""Latin America."" She is like a one-hit-wonder band from the 90's with nothing new to say.",0
There would be time when she would tell a joke in spanish and laugh at her own joke and rest of the class would stare at her as none of us would understand what she is saying. Talks a lot about herself. overall she is not that bad you can survive if you do the homework and quizes on time and do well on exams.,1
He's is a really nice guy but his class is way too hard. The quizzes are doable but his tests are impossible if you are not a naturally born history person. I was a 4.0 student in high school and ended up with a C in the class (my only C). Avoid his class if possible but if you must take his class DO ALL THE EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES.,0
"Do the homework on time and you can assure that you will pass. I passed this class because of that, and on prior knowledge of physics from high school. I only missed one class and learned almost nothing from him. Tests are nothing like the homework whatsoever. He gets frustrated when students don't understand a concept he thinks is simple.",0
Worst professor I have ever had! Assignments were unclear and very difficult. Would not recommend!,0
"Overall I don't think this prof cares about your grade. I initially was excited for this class, the prof also seemed excited & interested in the topic but that changed. Directions are not clear for most of the work. The research paper instructions were very vague & then harshly graded. Class was harder than it needed to be.",0
This guy is a total jerk....Really offensive and demeaning.,0
The assignments I had with her were easy. She also had very useful study guides on Canvas.,1
"I really enjoyed DJB as a person, she is funny and kind. I recommend going to her office hours before tests because they are actually helpful reviews and she will give you practice problems. I thought the class was difficult but thats not really due to her teaching but rather challenging material. Warning, she will cold call on you in class.",1
"Incredibly slow lectures.  Group work is also frustrating because he never wants your group to work ahead or he chastises you.  Also, office hours aren't ""open"" like any normal professor.  You have to email him the exact questions you want help with and that's all he will answer.   Very upset that I registered for his section.",0
"Syllabus was unclear. When you asked questions for clarifications on assignments or just in class, she was extremely disrespectful. She looked at you like you were stupid. When I asked for feedback, she barely gave any and said you were doing fine, then you would get a bad grade on assignments. Overall, she is disrespectful. Do not take her class!",0
"She didnt teach. No lectures, PowerPoints, & rarely communicated and this is an online class. All the assignments were on Connect & you basically had to teach yourself & read the text to learn. The midterm & final were proctored & you arent able to use any notes, the textbook, or search engines unlike the hw. Avoid her if you can, hard for GenEd.",0
"Good class, good professor, learned lots, she is passionate about class. She does pick favorites, if you are a young, middle-class white male, she will LOVE you.",1
"He mumbles too fast to understand anything, it always feels scattered! I have needed to read the textbook to understand a concept he tried to teach a few times in class. Quizzes/tests are inconsistent in difficulty. If you are thinking of taking astronomy, take it with the other prof. She's much better. I'll get a good grade but its so frustrating!",0
"AMAZING product, would buy again. I recommend this to all my friends.",1
"First half of the semester is a few books to read and a review on one. The rest of the semester is a 20 page paper. Also, include a short presentation on the paper towards then end of the semester. Do not wait until the last minute. He is very respectful and is intrigue on the research that goes into the papers. He heightens your knowledge of hist.",1
"She seemed to be very caring, but was a terrible teacher. We never once actually went through a power point. She would always leave it on the title page and then go talking about her life. Though we never once went over any actual material she still expected us to take the test which proved to be very difficult. Must buy textbook to pass.",0
"I took Math 90 online...Mr. Narin was a great professor to take an online class from.  His website was very clear...he (and his T.A., Linda) responded very quickly to any questions. You know exactly what is on every test and quiz because he provides a review before each with answers.  Definitely recommend!",1
"Constantly rambles off on tangents during lectures. Many of her diagrams made things more confusing. Changed the entire format of the midterm the week of, and instead assigned it for over spring break. Totally inaccessible out of class, never responded to emails, often waited until lecture to answer very time sensitive questions. Easy class tho",0
"First things first, his voice is the most monotone voice I have ever heard. If you do something wrong he looks at you like youre stupid. He goes on and on about the lottery and plays the hump day commercial before every class. He tries too hard in trying to make you laugh rather than actually teaching.",0
"I am a Semester 4 student of the paralegal education program and Ms. Pemberton is by far the very worst teacher at Humber College. She is very anal, she does not mark your valiant efforts well, and she is far too strict. Take another else for Criminal Summary Convictions and your grades will be great!",0
She is so mean and never teach. And didn't be responsible for her students.,0
Dr. Solano is a good guy. He's not like some of the other professors who just show up and treat each class like a routine. He really wants his students to succeed and will work with you to make sure that happens. Operations Management isn't the easiest subject but Dr. Solano teaches it very well. You'll get an A if you take it seriously!,1
"Loved this teacher! Very brutally honest about field and studies, but very thorough on material. Tests were essay take home, BUT about 10 questions with 10 detail questions each. Very time consuming. Overall great class, great proffesor.",1
"Has a very good understanding of the subject and is willing to answer questions/give help if you need it. Also since there are lots of sections of this course there are lots of opportunities for outside help. Must buy online book for code, lots of online homework. Attendence is mandatory.",1
This professor is not truly professor I think she bought her degree. She avoids teaching because she does not know. I think she is getting old and start losing her mind but she still comes to FGCU. Avoid this old hag and take it with someone else,0
He didn't make his grading criteria clear at all and then scolded the whole class for missing the point of the paper. He will make your life so much harder than it needs to be. Take literally any other professor for this class if you can.,0
"I took professor Aguilar my spring semester for 1302 and I would not reccomend to take her. She gets distracted very easily and gives assignments that are six pages long, sometimes more. She does set the boundaries straight from the beggining of the course and she will not take late work.",0
He is a great professor. He knows how to find ways to make the material stay in our memory. He is really the best of the best. You get a A in his class by paying attention. His study guides are helpful.He gives extra credits and gives you an idea on what it might be. Take him if you want to  get a good grade and learn at the same time.,1
"Professor Mark is a great, caring, and understanding professor. I have him for both 300/301(LAB) - as long as you get your work done, then you should be getting an easy A. Most of the work is from the textbooks but a lot of the exam questions are from his lectures so make sure to pay attention during lectures.",1
"If you don't understand accounting DO NOT TAKE HIM. You will FAIL. He thinks we should all be accounting majors and when you don't understand it he doesn't help. 4 Quizzes, lowest dropped, and a project. Quizzes  impossible.",0
Good professor,1
"The class is more of an art criticism class. Most class periods were not painting. We listened to her slideshows for many class periods, and when it was time to paint she wouldn't let you start painting unless she liked the idea herself. Made me feel bad about myself as a painter. Pushes her agenda on you. Take if you like abstract art.",0
Nice guy but not a good teacher. He did not reach me and didn't make an attempt to do so.,0
"His lectures are great and easy to understand, but his grading criteria is illogical. Take him at your own risk. You will learn the material but can be stressful",0
"He is by far the best professor I ever had at Fordham. Accounting is a tough subject, but he makes it easy and clear. Just read the textbook and his notes, and you are good to go.",1
"i got a 100% in this class...i got 100s on everything in the class, ofc i studied and tried to understand the material. he is the collest prof ever",1
She really doesn't know how to teach  and she gives you a bad grade even tho you work hard in her class sometimes she doesn't know what she talks about such a terrible teacher don't take her  ,0
Maria is a wonderful professor. She has a passion for the subject that not a lot of professors portray to their students. She has actually been to a lot of the places she speaks about in her lectures like the Guggenheim museum among many other places. Having her bring her passion was a breath of refreshing mountain air. Russian candy included.,1
"Ok, I have NEVER done a professor review. But Guetter is that bad. He is the worst professor I've had in my entire schooling. Get ready for LOTS of mathematica & nothing that expresses your Calculus knowledge. Get ready to be laughed at, belittled, & mocked for trying. I did well in the class, but I can't believe hes still employed. -stars for him.",0
Great professor - she makes difficult neuroscience concepts much easier to understand and apply. She has a strong clinical background and she facilitates incredible classroom discussions. Can't say enough good things about her! This is my favorite class I've taken in the USC MSW program,1
Good,1
"This was my first time taking this teacher. The assignments and class presentation were straightforward. There were reading responses each week, a presentation, & there were two options for papers: a few short papers or a longer paper that's due @ the end of semester. I like how she was very understanding, especially cuz of the pandemic.",1
Great professor,1
"I am so confused in his class, the whole class is. His lectures barely scratch the surface and his tests are the hardest thing that you will ever take. I do not recommend.",0
This professor is not good! She wants everyone to rate her the best on here. Like who does that she just isn't good at all. I wouldn't take her if I were you.,0
"He's amazing. Online class, however he's very willing to help via in person or over the phone  if you make an appointment. Class consists of weekly papers that involve reading primary texts, summarizing them and then analysing them. There are class discussions where you post on d2l and respond to students on a weekly basis also. Good professor!",1
He should be a literature lecturer in stead of a science or engineering lecturer. He keeps using fancy words and tends to make simple concept complicated. His teaching is very disorganized. 50% of the questions given in homeworks are not learnt or practise before.,0
Has no grading criteria at all so there is really no way to know what grade youre going To get on an assignment. Pop quizzes are given randomly and marked hard. Assignments are all very similar. PowerPoints are full of grammatical errors,0
"Really friendly and helpful guy, but I didn't care for his teaching style. Kind of just scribbles all over the blackboard. Tests were really difficult and didn't relate to lectures.",1
Dr. Young is very nice but the class itself is very hard and can sometimes be confusing. You have homework every day and weekly quizzes online. There is only 3 tests and a final exam.,1
Only took the online finance course; but my experience was a bad one. This is one of the poorest quality professors I have had a the university level. Outdated lectures/ practice problems will not help you prepare for the quizzes and tests. Quizzes and tests are given with a strict time limits and can be hard to complete. Lucky to get a C.,0
"Coop was a cool guy, but he was an awful teacher.  I often left class confused and didn't understand and went to office hours but his tests were 2600still hard,  but gives generous curves because of the low averages.  I did very well in calc in high school but his class was terribly hard & doesn't prep you for the final at all.",0
"Only like 4 homework assignments, all answers were on Chegg.  2 tests, midterm and final, pretty easy tests. Most of the work in  here are pretty intensive projects, 3 of them. Expect to work for several days and make a B.   He gives a ton of extra credit, up to 50 points that go toward the final test grade.  Lectures are pretty optional, no quizs",1
He is a pretty nice guy and makes a point of making himself available for individual questions after class. However the class itself is by far the hardest class to get an A in I have taken at this school. With new reading assignments each night (4 a week) usually ranging from 50-80 pages I spend more time on this class than my others combined.,0

He is a great professor! I would take him for every class if I could. He is very clear on what he expects from you. He is a super nice guy and has lots of experience with business and management. It is an easy course but you also learn a lot from him. Highly suggest taking him for any class. His study guides are the test and there's one project.,1
"He's friendly but boring. He just reads from the powerpoints and talks about random things. I could never understand what he was saying. Bring your laptop and do work for other classes. Lectures are pointless but he does take attendance. 1 quiz, 1 case study presentation, 1 take home test & a final. Super easy if you study a bit.",1
"Nice guy, but spends the entire class on a single PowerPoint. Goes really in-depth into most things, though, despite clearly wanting to focus on ancient Rome. Good for early-level history classes.",1
This professor taught us nothing. We were left hopeless and confused for the final exam. His quizzes and exams were completely unfair and so was his grading. He was rude and unhelpful. I wish I went and complained to someone about him because his class was really unfair.,0
Utterly incoherent. His lectures are a colossal waste of time - just review the slides on your own.,0
"How is a programming teacher going to refuse to look at code!!?? I simply cannot understand. If i got something wrong its obvious I need time to talk about it right? NOOOPE. ""Its wrong go away now"" - not a fan of this teacher AT ALL.",0
"Please get another professor, I'm writing this review because I use the website for reviews but I never wrote one so I realized that we as a student need to help each other! I'm helping you by saying this professor is no good!",0
"First day of class, prepare yourself for a rude awakening. He starts by telling the 100+ students that he's in the Illuminati. He has a history in law enforcement so step out of line even once and pay the price. I was fired from his class without the opportunity to voice my side of the story. Passed the CLEP exam at the community college next day.",0
"One of the most frustrating class I have ever took. He is no doubt a tough grader. There is A LOT of reading to this class, along with essays due after it. He takes attendance and MLA format really seriously, so check over your work multiple times to his liking. He comes off as imtimidating at first, but he is caring towards his students.",1
"Warning: Attendance is not required, but you will do very poorly in this class if you are not there for lecture. The books were lowkey useless. Everything you need to know is from the lecture. I mean, he seemed nice enough, but really awkward. My gripe was that he didn't seem very engaging and required FOUR books for this one elective class.",0
"I was really disappointed after taking this class. Dr. Misruda makes this class unnecessarily difficult for no reason. There's absolutely no rubric for assignments. He talks the whole lecture time without any participation, so it's really hard to pay attention. He will cover a needed topic one or two days before an assignment is due.",0
"Great teacher, completely knows what he is talking and tells great jokes.  Tough class and tests though.",1
"He an amazing teacher has very good notes for you to study with. textbook not needed but helpful when taking his term test and essay test. good thing is it takes two days. can write on terms to help essays. there is not final for the class, but there is a 10 page paper due at the end during finals week. if you see a movie that fits ask him about it",1
"Professor Kanchi's Cloud Computing class is awful. The lecture material doesn't cover the topics you need to know in order to succeed in the lab, she frequently doesn't respond to emails and has difficulty picking up on questions. Much of the material she provides for the lab is both erroneous and out of date. To do well, you need to find a student",0
"There are a lot of assignments. They are really useful, though. Professor Meacham is caring about her students. Her lecture is very clear. There are some other people who do not just listen to her and complain that her assignment is not clear. Come on! Just pay attention!",1
Dont take him.Very boring and waste of time and money.. Will not learn anything..Dont please DO A FAVOR ON URSELF...............,0
"She makes chem so fun! Explains things in an easy, but not juvenile, manner. Would definitely recommend!",1
"I took Mr. Camp for EH 101 and 102 and I dont recomend him for either. He isnt very clear on what hes grading for and he didnt give any feedback. Extremely tough grader, almost impossible to get an A. Do not take it unless youre trying to make your GPA go down bc thats all this class si good for.",0
"Horrific. She gave us a quiz one day after syllabus day that was extremely specific and difficult. She is not helpful and her teaching method of having students read and learn the material themselves through a dull and non-interactive textbook before each class seems counterintuitive. A professor's job is to teach students, not watch them struggle.",0
No Comments,0
"If I'd known of this site before registering & reviews, wouldn't have taken his class & have the regret. Only way to pass is if you tune everything out to hear him clearly since he mumbles & he could explain an essay prompt w/o you realizing it. Only assigns 400 word paper vs the 1,000 criteria. Learned nothing since he genuinely does not teach.",0
Lectures are pointless but you have to go because of pop quizzes. If you arent already experienced with computers or programming prepare to teach yourself. The class itself isnt that difficult but he assumes you have prior knowledge. Very bad lectures.,0
"All assignments are worth 100 points. If you do bad on one, your grade goes down a lot.",0
"I had him for POLI 1001 and I strongly suggest not taking this class unless you love politics or absolutely have to. Hard but few tests, no clear criteria for paragraph portions of tests. But despite that, it was interesting and not a waste of time.",1
Took summer course for PHIL 1304. Very clear outline in the syllabus. As long as you participated in discussion boards and did the web assignments on time you should do fine. All quizes and the final were open note. I honestly phoned it in a lot because I was starting a new job during this semester and still made an A+.,1
Mrs.Schultz is very hard core about making sure you do what she assigned you. Hard to understand at times. But overall good teacher.,0
"In my opinion, she took a ridiculous amounts of points for items graded and was clearly unfair in her grading.  Her grading comments were very unclear. An example, post 2 responses for discussion boards to meet the minimum requirements. The she takes a point because you only posted two.  How can you take points for meeting requirements?",0
"Dr. Ferriera was a great English Teacher, especially for a student just returning to college after a four year break. I loved her class, and I would definitely take it again. She is very helpful, if you have a question, ask it! She is very enthused about her subject as well. If you study and do your homework, this class goes by very smoothly! ",1
"I was a little skeptical to take an online communications course, but I was pleasantly surprised. Every week there is a chapter reading and quiz on pearson revel, and either a journal prompt or a discussion board to respond to. There are also several extra credit opportunities. As long as you read the chapters and do the work, you'll do fine.",1
She does not prepare you the at all for anything. As a result the class has a failing average!SWITCH OUT if you have the chance!,0
"All I can say is: RUN! She does NOT give out A's, I did all assignments perfectly and still got a B. She literally takes off points for no reason. If English is not your first language, you are screwed because she expects a perfect grammar essay on nutrition EVERY week. She seems to enjoy ruining lives. She is the WORST TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!!!",0
I took a class in the spring with Professor Rios-Freund and she tells the funniest stories while also teaching us the grammar and culture. She's an excellent teacher! She is very easy to understand and always answers questions after class. ,1
"Always comes in late, always has an excuse",0
This guy knows his material but loses the audience often.  He doesnt know how to teach.  There is a huge difference between a master of material and master at teaching the material.  I have had to teach myself everything even after attending lectures and sitting in the front row. ,1
Great professor! makes botany more fun by doing outdoor activities. Definitely recommend taking this class ,1
Very arbitray in his grading and is boring in class. AVOID if at all possible. I didnt heed the advice and now have this as my worst class in my CAREER,0
"Midterm: 30%, final: 40%. Most people skip lecture as it's hard to follow - read textbook instead. Quite tough on partial credit on exams. That said, he tests on less than the material covered and is clearly a very fair grader who cares about students succeeding (also has no curve, but drops lowest quiz and HW). TA is incredibly helpful.",1
"Lectures are dragged-out and could be much shorter if she didn't give multiple 30-minute breaks. Also, Aplia assignments get graded by average instead of your highest score. Let's say I get a 5/5 on the second or third attempt of a problem, the final score would be something like 2.7/5 depending on what you got in previous attempts.",0
Easily gets distracted. Rambles a lot. Turns a five minute information session into 20 useless minutes. She can be demeaning and talk down to you. Can make you feel very stupid. Also doesn't mind confronting and embarrassing you in front of your patients so make sure you are 100% ready to enter the patient's room with her.,0
"Rossi is my department head and is the most unorganized human being I've ever seen.  His lectures revolve only around social mobility, and he  emails readings sometimes an hour before they're due.  I read more for this than my 400 level courses, and I walk away with so much less from this stupid course.  A waste of a History major's time.",0
Prof. Shine is really a sweetheart! He really cares about his students and how they are doing rather than just pushing work on you. His work expectations were clear and grading is fair. The only downside of his class was that his voice is so soothing it is easy to doze off while he is reading.,1
"Prof Hart wants you to learn but is very unorganized, if you can stand hearing the word ""um"" 10000 times then its the class for you, dont even bother printing the handouts because you cannot follow them! The readings are pointless n mean nothing. WOULD NOT TAKE HER AGAIN!",0
"He's a good guy, but a lot of what he teaches is hard to understand because of the way he teaches it. I strongly recommend having a background coding before taking this class, otherwise it'll be hard!",0
"Really great professor, one of my favourites. You print out his notes from the D2L page, and you write answers and notes on them in class. Amazingly simple format, I do wonder why I haven't seen other profs do it. Go to class. You actually do stuff, and it helps a lot. He also gave old midterms to study with. Would take again in a second",1
"Nearly absent from course most of semester. Finals week and still no grades/feedback from Oct assignments. Multiple weeks between answered questions by students, some after assignments questions regarded were due. Often unclear expectations of assignments, tough to know what to do. Very little engagement from Kristi this semester. Disappointing...",0
"She is a very nice lady, but the class is spent going over problems. Tons of extra credit is available. Her tests always seem so much harder then what was gone over in class. And she loves fractions..",1
"Katselis tends to just copy straight from the ECE313 course notes when he lectures. Occasionally, he'll bring his own examples into the mix to try to help, but this class was still difficult for me. He is willing to do review days before exams if time permits. Probability and stats just aren't my thing and his teaching methods helped very little.",0
"Cesar is fun! You'll like him. =)  The class is only somewhat difficult, but he keeps it fun. You'll need to participate a LOT in class to earn an 'A' for that requirement. It will make a difference on your overall grade, so don't be afraid to speak or make mistakes....just talk!",1
"Choose a different teacher. Exam reviews are inaccurate and you might as well not even read them. Everything is so unorganized, and much of what's on the exam is not on the reviews. Just a mess of a class. Be prepared to teach yourself, or look up other lectures online relating to the same topic because they will teach you more.",0
"Great professor! I had him for 3 classes, and enjoyed his perspective and humor.",1
"She is very knowledgeable and helpful regarding the material.  The problem is she is very inconsistent, and does not follow her syllabus regarding when assignments are due or when to expect an exams. She also loaded on a lot of work that was not in the syllabus near the end of the semester.",0
Amazing professor. Yue Lao shi cares about all of her students. You can tell just by being around her that she wants every student to succeed. The workload is what you make of it. If you don't understand something she will gladly go back and review. She takes a lot of time to go beyond the textbook but the quizzes/tests are based on the textbook.,1
"She is a great teacher.  Pay attention in class, and make sure you do the  homework.  If you do that, the tests will be pretty easy.  She is also very helpful.",1
"Horrible! One of the absolute worst professors I've had to take. He says the content is easy if you study... that's bogus. Doesn't do well explaining concepts, and don't even bother with him in office hours. He comes off as cold and calloused.  He CLEARLY doesn't like teaching. SERIOUSLY! GO ELSEWHERE AND TAKE IT!!!",0
"Terrible. Does not show you how to do anything. One of those teachers who tries to be your friend. Homework is all online. Makes you do packets in class while she walks around ""helping"". If you are in a MWF short class you will be lucky to get one question in. Overall a terrible teacher for physics and you are better off teaching it to yourself",0
"If you care about cognitive psych, take this class with someone else. If you don't care about cognitive psych, find another class--don't suffer through this one. He tends to spend 5-10 on slides with less than 15 words on them. Know the studies, or better yet, just don't take this class with him.",0
"Prof. Lichtman is awesome! He explains the material very well, and he really cares about his students. He wants them to learn what covered in class. He gives many assignments, and the final is a lot of writing but not hard at all. Very interesting class if you want to learn!!",1
"Even though the homework was lengthy, you were not required to do every single problem he assigned. His quizzes were easy, the tests were pretty easy and the reviews reflected everything on the tests. He is a great guy and cares about you understanding the material. I had him my freshman year for mth 119 as well and was awesome!",1
"I hated this class. She talks about nothing! She is more interested in elephants and cheetahs then she is about anything else. She rambles and goes off topic so much its really hard to stay on track. She also likes to say, ""well we'll cover that in a later chapter."" instead of staying in the chapter we're on. Be prepared to study hard!",0
"She was unclear on everything that she would assign. It was confusing, the lectures were long, she accuses you of cheating with no facts to back it up, and she will not reply to your e-mail's. I would not recommend this ""teacher"" to anyone. She is rude and inconsiderate to her students. The worst experience in a semester.",0
"She is very detailed on the work she goes over in class, but her exams are much harder than anything she covers in class or on the homework. There are quizzes regularly, about 2-3 a week, but they aren't worth too many points. If you're going to take her, just make sure you do the homework and then some, because she's a very hard grader.",0
"Monica Hall is an amazing professor!  She is very clear when explaining different topics.  BIO 121 is a very difficult class, but she makes the material make sense.",1
"Most people like him, he was ok but tests are extremely difficult, I'd go in knowing I was going to get an A and end up getting Cs and Bs. He even got mad at our class for having low test scores. I wouldn't highly recommend him if you're aiming for an A",0
"Bob is so much fun and definitely one of the best professors I've had in all of college. A great guy with a lot of charisma, you'll love this professor no doubt in my mind.",1
Kinda like his son...tells stories for like 20 mins that could be told in about 30 seconds...other than that great professor:-),1
"Dr. Victor Montes-Jordan By far the best science teacher I have ever had  , Dr. Montes is intelligent beyond words, you can ask him anything health related and he knows the answer. I would recommend this class to anyone who needs a strong grasp of the material. HOWEVER if you don't study you will not pass, you will  have to EARN your grade. ",1
"I took her online class and it was like we didn't even HAVE a teacher. She assigned the homework. Never really helped or returned emails. While she was teaching the class she graded maybe four assignments. (She just gave us all full points for turning them in.) Unless you like to learn straight from the book, don't take her; she's an awful teacher.",0
Gives good lectures but very opinionated and doesn't really open her mind to student's perspectives. Memorize her opinions on topics in order to do well in the class and on the exams. She is kinda rude and detached from students. She is also a really tough grader and multiple people in my class including myself said she didn't grade fairly.,0
"Professor Zink is one of the most capable professors I've had (already been through a bachelors at a liberal arts school). She is extremely passionate and knowledgable on the subject of writing and storytelling, she truly lives it. It sometimes feels like she's always experiencing the world through the POV of storytelling. Take her if you can!!!",1
"Not a very good experience.  Class was merely a powerpoint cut and pasted from readings, and grading was not very consistent or fair.  She's knowledgeable on EU stuff but not fair in grading assignments.  If you have a choice, take a different section with a real professor, as she is just a PhD candidate.",1
"This class was tough but I'm so grateful that I chose Mr. Ariail's Capstone course. If you want an A in this class you will have to earn it. Mr. Ariail is willing to help you every step of the way and is always available, he truly cares. Looking for a Capstone course to take? Do yourself a favor, sign up for his class! Best instructor I had at TCC.",1
Leftists will love him. He only sees his side of things and grades accordingly. Will never take his classes again.,0
This was the WORST and I repeat WORST professor I have ever taken. It might be better to delay your graduation than to take this man and hurt your GPA. He just doesnt have enough experience to teach math and will simply not work with you. He expects you to memorize formulas that are just extremely unnecessary and removes points for foolishness.,0
A lot of reading but worth it the material is very thoughtfully chosen and thoroughly discussed in class. The professor is very sweet and funny.,1
I love Dr. Ortega! He is so nice and caring and you will learn so much from him. His accent is not difficult to understand and he is always there for office hours. He is an amazing professor that loves what he does and is very passionate. He is a caring person and will give extra points to help the class when they need it. Definitely recommend him!,1
one word. horrible,0
"He is running capstone this year. He is terrible. Poor communication and organizational skills. We met maybe 4 times over both semesters, excluding our progress presentations, which went terribly. He told groups their projects weren't difficult enough, despite having already approved them. Just goes to show he didn't read the proposals.",0
"Sara is seriously one of the best professors I've had at Iowa.  She clearly loves her job and social work, which helps students learn easier.  The class was really easy, but definitely enjoyable.  Can't wait to take more of her classes",1
For a gen. ed course this was probably the hardest class I've taken at BU so far! She expects wayyyy too much out of her students when over half aren't majoring in ENVS! She doesn't give study guides you are just suppose to look over the notes and her exams are ALL SHORT ANSWER! I was happy when the class was over,0
"I had him for 1201 and 1202. He was a funny guy and knew his stuff, but was one of the toughest graders I have seen. If you don't do word for word on his exams, you'll get points off automatically. He'll also roast you if you word a question wrong.",1
"Ridiculously hard for online classes. Be prepared to either know math beforehand, know someone who can tutor you intensely or teach yourself. I'm an A student and worked my rear off to barely get an A. I can't even say I learned a much so it wasn't helpful for future use... Would not recommend.",0
"He just read off his power points, so lecture wasn't really necessary. I NEVER used the book, and the one he tells you to get is the wrong one. He want you to get a CD-ROM version, but the one listed is for online. He gives you a practice test from past years to study from and some of the questions are word for word on the actual test. No Final.",1
"He talks very loud and fast, and for me personally is hard to take lecture notes. If you don't take notes be prepared to read and do some research. ",0
"Presents relevant content with practical application.  Conscientious, generous, invested, knowledgeable.",1
"Very easy to take --- tests are not difficult, and the research papers are a piece of cake.",1
"Wei is not a good ""professor"" and is too full of herself. She is spiteful towards her students and does not give a crap about them, uses them as a means to an end. Lectures are unclear, not very helpful outside of class, and is an unpleasant person. She also loves to complain about how UW students are lazy.",0
"Would not ever recommend. He knows his stuff but he expects everyone to get it as easy as he does. Gets upset/irritated when you have questions and dont understand. He will mock you or try to belittle you, Im a good student come to class every day on time and hes still a pain.",0
"She gives clear information, will correct mistakes right away. She is upfront on expectations. Grading is fair. She will work with you if you do not understand the information. She gives time to students to ask important questions on material discussed in class.",1
"Absolutely my fav professor! He is such a funny, genuine, and great professor! Also gives great lectures!",1
"It would be a great class if she stuck to subjects like, I dont know, German. I dont pay my hard earned money to hear a language professor give her inane comments about the patriarchy and gender discrimination. Other than that the pedagogy is good. This being said, the other GERM instructors are also great so I recommend them to new students.",0
"He gives 300 question study guides for a 50 question test and you basically have to memorize every single question. Three exams and one final note test. The class is structured very weird, lectures and then go home and teach yourself the material from the textbook. I should have dropped this class when I had a chance.",0
"Unorganized- does not follow the syllabus, Tons of HW -so you will never see the day of light. I've taken many online courses and this one was the worst. Does not teach anything. 3 Tests- first one 50 questions; test 2- 75 questions; final 100 Q; weekly discussions and must respond to others; must turn in 10 750 word essays.",0
"The textbook is really just different books that he'll assign you to read. It's possible to BS your way through, but he'll figure out eventually if you're not reading & that'll affect your grade. Lectures are more class discussions which are interesting. Midterm & final are papers. Changes how he arranges his class quite frequently.",1
"I had dawn for GH 125 and thought she was amazing, a lot of our class loved her. It's not hard at all if you show up and do the work. Im amazed with everyone posting how horrible she is. Yes she allowed for a lot of stories from others which drove me nuts but she is very straightforward. Again-PUT THE EFFORT IN and you'll do fine!",1
No Comments,1
Took a seminar with her.  She's amazing at facilitating discussion and keeping the discussion on track and connected.  Very clear and brilliant.  So kind and helpful and understanding in office hours. Fair grader and wrote an entire type page of commentary on our essays for how to improve. Highly recommended.,1
I learned a lot about art and myself taking this class.  Mi-Sook is a nice person and knows her stuff.  She pushes you to do your best which sometimes stresses you out.  She's honest and tells you if your project sucks.  Expect to spend time and money on every project.  BE PREPARED TO MISS SLEEP WHILE TAKING THIS CLASS. Take if dedicated to art.,1
"Dr. Lamkin is super hard. She jumps from first slide to random slides while explaining. Don't take anatomy with 3-4 classes. Requires a lot of reading, understanding and the most important memorizing. If you want an A you should like put A LOT of time studying. Definitely not an easy A. Her labs are extremely hard like her lectures! No extra points",0
"WORST PROFESSOR EVER! she literally does not answer her EMAILS! she is a communication professor yet her inability to get back to you with attitude is unacceptable. Her workload is insane she acts like her class is the only one, meanwhile there is other courses. too much for a 200 level class .",0
"She's a great professor, very organized, and gives clear lectures. She doesn't give any homework, so all you have to do is pay attention in class. The tests are extremely fair, and she gives extra credits depending on participation. I wish all my professors are like her!! Will take her for every class if that's possible.",1
I have had Kubota sensei for several classes now and she definitely stands out as the best Japanese teacher at EMU. However she is very strict and sometimes brutally honest. If you can't handle that sort of thing don't take her class.,1
"I took Dr. Bowman for arts in contemporary society for the summer, online. Her class has a lot of work for being a 3 credit course but if you stay on top of it youll do fine. I was nervous from reading the reviews but I made an A. She expects you to write well so if writing is not your strong suit, I would not advise taking her.",1
"I'm not even finished with the semester yet, but I just hafd to leave this review. Adam is an amazing professor. He is very clear, straightforward and in-depth. With all of the math teachers I've taken over my life, he is the best. He explains things in a variety of ways to make sure you understand. Isnt afraid to slow the course down if you dont.",1
"Even though I have previous calculus experience, it all left my brain the second rogers started talking. Think you know how to do something? Think again!! Good luck getting 10/10 on anything because he will always find one little thing to dock off. Tests? 8 pages at least and does not relate to any of the problems that we did in class. Good luck!!!",0
"He doesn't teach the material; he expects you to learn on your own. Wastes valuable class time telling personal stories having nothing to do with the subject, wasting my money. Need I say more?",0
"If you want to learn, take his class. He is a really good teacher who is always willing be happy to help students. You will see he put his effort to his work. You will learn and improve a lot from his class. However, if you look for an easy class and easy grade, do not take this class.",1
"He expects way to much from his students, doesn't give us guidelines of the course and whats expected of us. He's tries to be funny and mean (which he is) but then in turn it makes students scared to ask questions, then he gets mad and yells at us that we arent asking questions. Buddy curved our midterm form 23% to 46% ... he will give everyone F's",0
She grades very hard on your writing.  You could be an awesome writer in you whole school career but with her your writing will suck.,0
Jennifer is rude to her students for no apparent reason. It makes learning very difficult.,0
"I took Numerical Computations with him. The class is super easy- 3 quizzes that are open notes (and he gives a study guide with all the answers), 6 homeworks that he practically does for you, and one project that isn't much harder. His lectures are well organized and he has code samples in a ton of programming languages. Very nice guy.",1
"Bias information presented without any acknowledgement of different socioeconomic views. Very limited experience as an 1 of the 2 black   .  In class. Poor representation of the black family, overall discouraging and unhelpful. Grading structure is vague and unpredictable. Consider a different course.",0
"I came into this course very nervous, through what past students have told me. At first it was very easy and I thought I was getting the hang of it. She didn't tell me what I really did wrong on my essays and told me ""it was a good piece of writing"". She ended up failing my final portfolio, and told me I didn't fix what she told me to. Do not take",0
Unorganized and no concept of time management - lost grade book for some of the semester - I never knew how I was doing during the semester.  I spent 1 5 weeks feeling frustrated and confused and bored.,0
"Awful professor. Only talks politics in a physics class. Quiz after every class, most of which are completely unrelated to physics. Big waste of tuition money.",0
"he's a good professor that explains his information really well. He gave out study guides to complete that helped so much with test. You do have to get the book but honestly you dont even need to read it. I passed without reading it, just come to class and take notes on the powerpoints and youll do great.",1
"Professor Blake is a real asset to Northern Virginia Community College. A man with great advice not just on Spanish, but academics in general and will always offer support if you decide to seek it on your part, I haven't had a better teacher at this campus. Be prepared to take notes and be active/pay attention in lecture.",1
"If you just want a self-learner that wants a GPA booster then sure take her. But if you actually want to be taught and learn something out of it then maybe not, can easily do the same by just doing readings on your own :) She's really nice though!",1
"GREAT MATH INSTRUCTOR! Very helpful and extremely nice. Kinda cute and pretty funny, too. Take Stats with Professor Fry for sure!",1
"The class gets progressively harder over time. The first exam is easy and the second one is a little bit harder. Then, she gives a final exam that is a conceptual advanced statistical final that is worth 40% of your grade. She is weasely and makes you think the class is easier than it is in the end.",0
"Fifty minutes into her lecture and all Ive heard is how great of teacher she is (shes not) and how easy this class is to pass (it's not). For some reason the most difficult class I have is this ""blow off class"" and let me tell you it is not. Her mid term is huge and only 4 days to work on it. ""At least you woke up this morning"" Almost wish I didn't",0
"I don't know why all physics professors aren't like him. He is very practical. He knows what students should learn. After this class, finally I am able to relate physics with my daily life. His Grading is very clear and easy if you follow all of his lecture. Exams aren't that tricky, mostly from homework. Definitely recommend him.",1
"Glenn is laid back. Was graded by 3 papers, best 10 quizzes, and best 10 weekly paragraphs. Did assign weekly readings about the concepts but after a while It became easy to take notes on what's important from the text without actually reading it. Asks 2 EC questions per quiz and papers were easy to write.",1
"I took this class online and was much easier! I took Econ 2301 and 2302. I took five classes aside of these and I was able to pass both classes with A's!!! She's a great professor and responds emails really quick!!! If you really have to take this class,I would recommend you to take her online!!! Expect homework cause you will have some. Not hard! ",1
"She's a nice lady and is overall very intelligent when it comes to the language. However she gives you so much work, she must think it's the only class that matters. Don't be late or miss class or you'll fail. Four in class presentations and one is done with group. Oral presentations as well each week. She's nice but she'll kill your GPA.",0
"I thought he was boring and sometimes difficult to understand, but his class wasn't unbearable.  I took Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, so he only taught for a few weeks.  I wouldn't take another class with him.",0
"Spotty English, mandatory iclicker participation, essay, group project. Midterm consists of short answer and multiple choice. Same with final ",0
Great professor. I highly recommend him for any class he teaches,1
"best in the soc dept, by far",1
"I'm not really interested in biology, but Maher makes this class pretty painless. His powerpoints are verbatim from the book and if you do the homework, you'll do fine on the tests. Going to class is necessary though, since his ""attendance"" grade is from questions he asks in class and he does not announce when he will take attendance.",1
Marek is the worst thing that has happened to the education system since the attack on Columbine. His grasp of English is so poor you spend more time deciphering his mumblings than you do taking notes. He seems very ill-informed on the subject matter and generally spends more time confusing himself than teaching us anything.,0
"At first I really enjoyed the class , but it went somewhat downhill. I learned a lot from the class, but felt that the teacher was judging what people said, even though it is supposed to be a share zone. She also grades papers very hard based on APA and wording, not so much content. I would rather not take again. I dreaded the last weeks of class. ",0
"I really enjoyed this class to start with, but I found that Martin made the content more confusing than it should have been. You can learn the same amount from going to two weeks of his lectures as you can from watching a 12 minute YouTube video on the subject. He gives no application type questions, everything is theoretical, and only grades tests",0
awesomeness!,1
"Professor Hanratty is a good teacher. Although she holds high standards, it really allows you to become more responsible for your work. She is a tough grader. When she provides feedback on your papers, make sure to take the advice she gives you and DON'T blow it off. The comments she gives you will really help improve your writing for your papers.",1
"Mary Layoun is a very nice person. Its nice that participation is 30% of grade but lectures are just painful. She will talk about ""trying to get people to talk about difficult topics"", then turn around and make offensive asides in lecture. TA's grade your 3 papers, and they are really strict. If you're not a lit major, then I wouldn't recommend. ",0
WOW HARD HARD HARD CLASS nice instructor though and you'll deffantly laugh in his class love Mr.K but hate the class lol,1
"He's a great professor! Favorites sociology teacher so far. Dissects the readings very clearly with the help of students' thoughts. Very inclusive and engaging. He has a personal story connected to pretty much about everything we talk about in class, so it makes things relatively easy to remember. Overall great!",1
"Maher has been great for me in both Mammalogy & Bio Stats. Very laid back teacher but at the same time he knows how to enforce his material properly. A lot of it is straight from the book so buying the required book(s) is highly advised. He has some good humor, is very approachable & good at answering questions. Would take again. -NL",1
Really tough Professor. Not reachable by email which is the only way to communicate now.,0
Prof. Lohrey is always ready and willing to answer any questions you have. That is mostly how he runs his class-he wants you to go in and ask questions about anything you have trouble with. Do the Wiley homework because it WILL help you on the tests. He even told us exactly which kind of problems were going to be on the test!!! That helped A LOT.,1
"Dr. Mehta is one of the best professors I have ever had thus far. His assignments take time and effort, but are carefully crafted so as to effectively teach the material and do not feel like 'busy work'. Beyond this, Dr. Mehta is a genuine and caring person who likes to get to know his students.",1
He is not a good teacher.,0
"She grades weirdly and words her questions/directions weirdly because she doesn't proof read. Also, she wants us to cite our sources but will give us a 0 on the assignments/discussion posts if we quote from them like what??? She expects you to do your own research in addition to the chapter reading for the test so you'll see q's you wont understand",0
Gartland is horribly unorganized and unprofessional. She goes on and on about her personal life. I'm not paying tuition to listen to her actively try to avoid teaching us the material. A number of us are considering complaining to the department chair.,0
"I dreaded this class every day! The class was so unorganized and not very interesting at all. The tests were common sense and never opened the book. As long as you go to class you will do fine on the tests. Marty is very credible and has a lot of accolades, but the other professor I had, You Li, was nice but not a good teacher.",0
"Mr. Pierce is a great professor! He cares about his students, and wants us to succeed. His quizzes and tests are heavily based on his powerpoints and lectures. He is great!",1
If you're looking to make money shooting weddings...then he knows what he's talking about. Anything else...I'd go to someone else for advice.,1
I have nothing negative to say about Mr. Butman. I tried the class out and did not comprehend with his way of teaching. So now i am retaking Eng. 28 with a differ Professor (SANGHA) and it is a dramatic change. I am learning the concept that needs to be met for this english class.,0
"I've never rated a prof on this site before but out of my two years at sfu, he's been my favorite. He genuinely cares about his students and is the most hilarious math prof ever. Made 8:30 am classes worth it, even though I skipped a lot of classes near the end of the semester lol",1
"I dont know about these ratings but, she required online text which was highly expensive and ridiculous and weekly quizzes. Pointless to go class but yet she takes role. Mostly for under division students. Overall, very bubbly personality",0
It's true that 3140 is hard. But Dr. Swift made it even harder. He doesn't fit into the online course AT ALL. You were expected to do heavy quizzes and exams within an extremely short time. And he actually think the time was way too much for the students. It's very upset that a professor can be such detached to his students.,0
"Professor Peters was an amazing professor for intro to psychology. Her class was not the easiest course, but it was by no means extremely difficult. For every exam, she is clear on what content is going to be on it. If you are unsure of anything, she always responds to emails to clarify. She is a very genuine and caring professor. TAKE HER!!",1
"I took stats 146 from McNabb summer qtr., hes an excellent teacher, has some great tricks to keep you focused and engaged during class. Extra credit was offered on a handful of occasions. He teaches out of the book, but puts the material in his own words, making everything much easier to comprehend. Highly recommended teacher!",1
Excellent class I tried to take his following class but it was full.,1
"This semester was different from the pandemic (DUH), but it really gave us a chance to see professor's true colors. Professor Draper was terrible. She didn't support us in this internship class. She added more work than she should have, given how stressful this semester was. She left me feel unsupported in this class and I would not recommend it",0
"Dr. Brown is an awesome teacher, I have and will continue to take any class he teaches.  He is funny and most entertaining teacher I have ever had! Just love his classes, makes you really want to attend class!",1
"You will have pop quizzes everyday in this class, which are extremely difficult to pass because this professor lectures on one slide the whole class. It is very hard to pay attention in this class because the professor is not good at lecturing and is very very boring. Very hard to pass this class, I do not recommend taking this.",0
"Worst teacher Ive ever take in my life. Strict on grading, no matter how hard you try he will always find some problem to lower your grade. WORST TEACHER EVER",0
"He's very inconsistent with what he says in terms of assignment requirements, and seemingly has trouble both communicating what he wants out of assignments, as well as understanding the questions students ask. This was honestly the worst and least enjoyable course I've experience. The workload was HUGE (24+hrs of drawing per assignment)& hard marks",0
"Such an easy class all quiz's are online, and projects are super easy. SAM assignments can be a little tricky but she's super helpful if you need it. Her due dates are constantly changing, but it's usually to ur benefit. BTW don't buy the book! you'll never use it.. All you need is the SAM code which u can buy for 60 amazon. Dnt spend the 200!",1
Would not take again. Very unorganized !,0
"The classes are extremely slow, heavy, and redundant. Her teaching method is very confusing unless you ask specific questions and get the answer youre looking for. Resources on blackboard are all over the place so it will take you a while to find the correct resource for the assignment youre working on.",0
"Took Terrorism from this professor. Clearly once a great class, but after decades has devolved into a long lecture on books that we do not read and general opinion. Not your typical history class -- No historical background in the traditional sense. The subject matter is fascinating but the class was disappointing. Almost dropped it twice.",0
"Amazing prof, one of the best I've ever had! Helps in detail if you ask.",1
"Professor Liao was very helpful this semester, especially with the craziness of COVID going on. He was very clear, thorough, and would go back if needed. He will answer any questions you have, and would definitely recommend taking him.",1
"In the beginning of class, she'll say how it'd be nice to see more people on camera- annoying especially to those not comfortable with that or who have bad internet. Other than that, the class is generally fine. Nothing special but at least it's something actually useful for the future: emails, resume, cover letter, LinkedIn, reports.",1
"Polanco made this class more difficult than it should have been.  I had to spend way too much time for her class.  It was a disproportionate amount of time compared to my other classes.   We had to do group work which I did not really mind. The last project was actually kinda fun, and helped end the class with not such a sour taste in your mouth.",1
"Lectures were not very helpful. Had to google most things for my homework, didn't buy the textbook nor did I need it. Doesn't take attendance so don't need to go to class. Not a stimulating class, not an easy class. He's a cool guy, but not a good professor",0
Wow! an amazing teacher. Kind and funny and laid back. Teaches well but doesnt take things so seriously that it brings down the class. Show up pay attention put forth an effort and you will do great!,1
"All these comments explain exactly what she is. She's great and I've never had a professor that cared so much. My grade might not be good, but it's my fault. All i know is that it's so easy & enjoyable. I love her class and love her way of teaching.",1
"I took her Communications class for food, agriculture and natural resource majors. Dr. Swenson is very clear on what she wants for assignments and very willing to help, you just need to take the initiative. The textbook for this class is a joke & much of it is common sense but read it ALL, she loves to tie the book concepts into lectures & quizzes.",1
"Dr. Burridge was fine but this class was definitely dreading. A lot of reading every week, an analysis assignment per week, and the final paper was killing me. This semester was additionally hard because he didn't allow us to choose topics for our final paper.",1
It's once a week and it's a steal in terms of class requirements. You will do great as long as you study/memorize the study guide he gives you at the end of each unit (the week before the exam). Take time for that and you will be absolutely fine.,1
"very oppinonated woman.  Gets on her soap box way too much and plays favorites big time.  Stay on her good side, and be sure to never question a grade she may give you, b/c she will hold it over your head.",0
Don't even bother with this professor... if you struggle with math don't take her.,0
"I've had her for many journalism classes and I love her. She's a tough person and she's quite strong in her ways, but she legitimately cares about you and is wanting to see all of her journalism students succeed. She's really great.",1
"I remember I went to several office hours and she does not know how to answer my questions. She tells me to refer to textbook (which I did prior to attending office hours). This is a horrible professor who isnt very knowledgeable of what she teaches. This is why tests are so easy, because she basically uses the textbook to come up with questions",0
"He is very pationate about this course.  He doesnt stick so well with the syllabus, and his class is a LOT of writing, but he does make it very interesting.",1
"Professor Carter is very knowledgable of the field. She applied ""real-life"" experiences/examples to the lectures. Lectures were interesting and she was helpful to the students. She would look over your exams and tell you to check the questions if they were wrong She encouraged students to write papers before due date so she could critique in advanc",1
"This prof also runs the skills lab and does not do anything for the students. She spends most of the time socializing with co-workers while she ignores students in the lab, or kicks them out for a hair appt. BTW the lab hours are always scheduled during class so you can never go. Completely useless...",0
"Prof. Mark is very nice and caring. Her lectures can be boring at times, but she tries to implement group activities to make it more enjoyable. On the other hand, she grades the group project deliverable way too hard. We spent 3 hours on a project(via zoom) & she gave our group a 40(COVID-19). Advice is to take the projects/deliverables seriously.",1
There is a midterm and a final and they are mostly comprised of the quizzes. Make sure to review the outlines. The quizzes have very specific questions and little amount of time is provided. There is an assignment due every week. You have to really WORK.,0
I picked her because all of the good reviews but that must be for those who had her in person. HORRIBLE for online!! Doesnt get back to you and doesnt care to give a good feedback even if you ask. Extremely hard grader and doesnt care to help you out. Would never take her class again.,0
I took her Intensive Intermediate Spanish for Heritage Learners and it was intense! There is a lot of work that goes into this course. She is really clear in her lectures though so I learned a lot. You really have to prepare yourself and manage your time for this course. There was a group project which was easy and the final paper was easy as well.,1
ESL teacher hard to understand sometimes. He is very unclear with his assignment instructions. Even though he gives a hand out with instructions he renegs and modifies assignments week to week. His individual project is a time consuming task that is riddled with busy work. You will gain nothing from it. The group project is somewhat interesting.,0
"I started out incredibly disgusted and discouraged by Prof Fowler's unclear, rambling style.  However, after a few weeks I got the hang of it, and the material wasn't that hard.  About 30 of us  got A+'s on the midterm, and who knows how many got A's.  You'll do fine, just read everything for the passage IDs and get a helpful TA!",1
"Probably the worst 1L Professor at Iowa. 30 Question MC Final on Civil Procedure, 5 questions on international law, 0 questions on minimal contacts/personal jurisdiction, 0 questions on the Erie doctrine. Yep, sounds like a Maya Steinitz Civil Procedure final exam.",0
"I think she was a great prof, and if I had the chance I would enroll in one of her classes! I am not sure what everyone dislikes about her. I went to every class, took notes, and received a great mark of 89%. She literally gave us the questions she would ask on the exam and really tried to engage the students in a conversation. Very good prof! :o)",1
"I decided to become an anthropology/sociology major because of her. Literally, one of my favorite professors. Changed my life. I can only dream of being like her one day.",1
"I took Math 1000 online with Danny Dyer and he literally did NOTHING. The TA's marked assignments in their own language and they offered no clarification nor did he. He used someone else's lectures for the entire course and always took at least a week to answer emails, which isn't helpful when the assignments are released 4 days before they're due.",0
"Goes through the slides fast, and the test has random questions",0
"I took this class for EDU 104 and I tell you I will highly recommend this professor. she is very funny and realistic, she understands and goes out her way to make sure you understand as well. she is always available after hours so that helps a lot. I love this professor she is a real GEM!!! Not to many professors are like her, she is the best!!!!!",1
"I had Sanda for GD1. She shaped how I work in the program, cares deeply about her students, and wants everyone to succeed. She is strict, structured, and caring. If you come prepared & ready you will be rewarded with one of the best instructors in the program. Also if you go to office hours she will inspire you and blow your mind with knowledge",1
"Must attend classes, but lectures don't help much as he reads off a Powerpoint. Ignore him and read the textbook. Overall not a good teacher; he gets angry when you ask questions and his attempt to answer math- related questions only causes more confusion. Avoid if you can",0
Don't take this class if you don't have to. You have a quiz at the beginning of every class on the chapter read in the book. The exams are difficult and hard to study for. The professor doesn't help much with teaching the material you basically have to learn it yourself.,0
"NOT an easy A kind of teacher. He will make u work 4 it! I got an A (thanks to xtra credit for perfect attendance). He gets frustrated if u question him too much or argue with him. My advice? GO TO TUTORING, stay quiet in clas (unless u have right answr) , good attendance  xtra credit, DO THE HW wa tutor!! He doesnt grade it, but it will help u! ",0
He is a real gem in helping people and teaching you how to help them.,1
"Dr. Hartman is an amazing teacher, intellectual, and person.  He is the best professor I had in my five years of college.  Do NOT pass him up.",1
"Enjoyed his class material, thought he was very niceelligent. Make sure to do the weekly study guide ?s & consider recording lectures bc lots of material. Always avail @ his office hours 2 answer ?. My only critic: his time management & organizational skills, lectures and lab would start late and run over because he lacks managing these areas.",1
"While Sam is a nice guy and pretty funny sometimes, I really didn't like this class/his lecturing style. Don't take this class if you don't like Linguistics, and especially don't take it if you learn better with visual aids because there were no powerpoints at all! Overall, don't take this class if it's just for your distribution",0
"There is considerable reading in the class but this is made known up front. A test after every three chapters. If you read the chapters and do the homework along with reading there is no reason you should not get an ""A"" in the class.  Discussion questions are also required but they are simply your opinons about subjects that the professor suggests.",1
"For those students who said she's easy, it might be compare to another male professor who's teaching this course. She's a tough grader I have ever seen, her assignments were confusing as hell. she took lots of points off if you had little mistakes. btw you won't learn a thing from her class. If you can't skip her class, good luck and have fun.",0
run away. take a different history class.,0
"Extemely intelligent and insiteful woman.  Fantasic teacher, failed acct 1 then took her and got an A-  Makes students enjoy the subject and applies it to everyday situations.  Also, doesn't hurt that she is quite attractive :)",1
"Nice guy, wants to do examples but gets sidetracked and forgets to finish example. His test are dialed down from material covered.  Overall, class is bs and shouldn't be required to graduate!!",0
"I had Dr. Kauanui for Conflict Management and she was great. She really worked with the class if we wanted to change around extra credit or grading, graded fairly, and although she rambled a bit at times, she was extremely helpful and knowledgable on the subject. I enjoyed her real life examples from her personal work experiences.",1
"Never take it, unless you have really smart friends to get answer from them. He is boring, not easy at all, you have to write well for every tests, and TA s are  hard grader, they grade hard for this class.",0
Be prepared to stress but good thing is that open book besides on midterm and final.,0
This class was the hardest thing I have done in my life. This class made me very sad and depressed when I thought about it. Definitely prepared me for chem 2 but not sure it was worth the stress.,0
My favorite professor that I've had at App so far. I was eager to come to every one of his classes just because you could tell he was passionate about what he was teaching. Everything we learned was eye-opening and important and useful in order to go out into the world and to be a good person. Definitely take him even if you're not an anthro major.,1
"Really cares for his students and will go the extra mile for anyone of his students. He's hilarious and makes you think about things from a whole new perspective. He expects you to do quality work and actually tries to help improve your writing skills. Do yourself a favor and take his class. Great professor, even better person. ",1
He shows up about 5 minutes late everyday.,0
"Very difficult to understand her teaching style. She isn't really one to answer any questions as her excuse is ""I don't have enough time"" to answer them. Her grading style is very off and seems a little unrealtic to pass the class. I don't recommend taking her if your math skills aren't up to par. She's not one to go into detail about.",0
"Many dislike Serocki, but I actually enjoyed his humor and overall character. However, his lectures are power point based. He doesn't read slides word for word, but he just skims them stream of consciousness style because he knows everything. Numerical examples are few and far between. HW optional. Not the worst tax class you can take I think.",0
Dr. Solano is one of the best professors ive ever had. He teaches by lecturing and hands on in class practice done through Pearson. He pulls up excel on the projector and does the problems along with us while we do them on our own computer. Tests are also on pearson and are just like the homework/ in class examples so theres never any surprises.,1
"He is a very nice man. Helps with proofreading papers more than any other professor I've ever had. As long as you participate in class, always come to class, and meet with him to discuss and revise your papers (3), you should do well.",1
"I'm a history major so I thought this would be an easy class being that I have finished most of my upper level division courses and for some reason skipped this one. I've never in my life failed anything history related and I failed all three tests that she gives. Her tests are all essay, and she expects you to almost quote her verbatim.  ",1
"Super easy, super fun. Take this class. ",1
"Truly an unnecessarily tough grader. During the corona virus crisis she did not lower her expectations of us, and additionally stated during class time that she would spend less time grading our work and would give us fewer comments on how to improve. Though through her words she acted sympathetic to her students, her actions spoke otherwise.",0
"Absolutely loved her! She's very caring about her students, I will be taking her again.",1
"The absolute worst math professor ive ever had. Doesnt know how to teach whatsoever. If you have a question, dont even bother asking because it definitely wont get answered. Makes you teach yourself and if you have a question his answer is ask the person next to you. Terrible. 0/10 professor.",0
Great Teacher!  He is fair and expect the best out of each student.  Slackers be awarded!,0
"The best teacher I've ever had. He will go out of his way to help anyone, plus he's hilarious. You do have to do the work or you won't pass, but all of the work is online & fairly easy. No tests either. He makes the class very enjoyable. HIGHLY recommend him!",1
"Mr. Nelson is a really nice guy and very understanding, but he lectures every day, nonstop. It is tons of note taking, but the tests just consisted of choosing vocab words and writing the definitions, then a couple pre-chosen essays. You have to go everyday as he doesn't use Blackboard to post notes. He's an ok choice, but a super friendly guy.",1
4 week class. 2 tests (m/c & t/f 70 to 75 questions in 60 minutes). 1 cumulative final on all 16 chapters (75 questions m/c & t/f in 60 minutes) Assignments are pretty easy. 1 20q quiz per chapter & 2 to 4 assignments for each chapter (takes 1-3 hrs a day). 5 to 6 chapters per week all assignments & quizzes due on Sunday. Can work at your own pace.,1
Amazing professor. Makes morning enjoyable and he is very detailed about his lessons.,1
Dr Juergensjurgens a good writer.,1
"Dr. Maher is a good professor. His powerpoints come directly for the textbook, and he posts them to blackboard so you really don't need to go to class but I would recommend going because he gives you participation quizzes which you don't even have to get the right answer to get the points. Lectures are boring, but the tests aren't hard, just study.",1
"Honestly this class was unreasonably difficult for a 101 class. It's not that it was hard necessarily, just way too much work expected for such a low level course. Lectures were not good and she just read off the slides for the most part that had nothing to do with the tests. Too much outside work and event attendances required.",0
This class is a disorganized mess.,0
"Not a fan of professor Sikora whatsoever, terrible lecturer, not easily accessible, taught myself the whole course the textbook. However, his tests are a joke so I guess that helps.",0
"Alright, Ted is a great guy. Young, relates well to students, cracks jokes, knowledgeable. But he was very unclear and even confused himself at times teaching the slides; students had to correct his mistakes. His tests are ridiculously long and hard, even for a 50 minute class. Also, if you ask him a question during a test, he won't help at all.",0
Good teacher,1
"She's really sassy sometimes, but not in a funny way. She seems to clearly have students that she prefers and kind of comes across as fake caring.",0
"You're back in high school with Rankin. Does not help you at all, just says it's test material and she can't comment on it, even though it's in class and not an exam day. The Lab skill training taught me way more than she did, it's pretty easy if you just do the lab assignments a couple of times. Would NEVER recommend Rankin to anyone.",0
"HORRIBLE TEACHER: Does not get back to your questions, any question you have you have to post it on the ""discussion board"" in front of the WHOLE class. HARD grader, how the hell can you fail a computer class? (I am very tech savy even) This guy is a joke",0
Whoa! Dis man be da best teacher i ever done have. Can't say nuff good tings bout dis good sir. He be forever my favorite. He is be a famous man too and not just to me's. I's evens passed his class so dat is a darn good ting also's.,1
Awesome! Class structure is fair and work load is relatively- balanced for a six week summer course. Provides great feedback and is very approachable/friendly,1
"Dr. Batman knows his stuff, and is willing to help those who are struggling in his office with a homework problem. I would highly recommend this class to anyone.",1
"4 exams composed of questions requiring perfect memorization of several philosophical persons. He personally attacks you for not reading or being incapable of answering his questions. NOT OPEN-MINDED AT ALL! Utters inappropriate things in class and is just an all-around bad professor. More than half the class dropped the first week, but I couldnt.",0
Rombo is a very nice person but a poor teacher. She is very knowledgable but is not very good at explaining the concepts. She gives study guides but be prepared to study 2-3 weeks before an exam because they're not specific or accurate to what she says in class. Her lectures talk in circles sometimes and we spend half of class talking about nothing,0
All my prior interest in terms of research vanished when Pam was assigned to the class. Doesn't know how to budget time to teach all material. Doesn't understand how to assign appropriate amounts of work. Her exams were a nightmare - unclear and silly. Avoid at all costs!,0
"Ms Carter is a great teacher. She is professional and discusses the material only required for the class. She will help if needed. She tries to make sure everyone understands the subject. She gives notes and reviews for every quiz and exam. Don't try to take advantage of her. If you think it's going to be an easy A, it's not. You have to earn it!",1
"Professor Mantell was amazing! She's probably the most caring professor I have ever had. Lectures can sometimes drag on and you don't realize when you stopped paying attention and it's not a very exciting subject matter, but take Professor Mantell... she will get you through it!",1
"Good man, very nice, but shouldn't be teaching anymore. First quiz was very easy, midterm was very hard due to poorly worded questions. Second quiz should have been easy but like his previous exams there were mistakes riddled throughout. Average for the class rn is maybe around a 50 (you can see everyones grade).S/U-covid is saving my GPA luckily.",0
"Cool, laid back guy. Just lectures from a slideshow, emails you the slides after class. Gives two tests, which are super easy. Def take if you're not the best science.",1
"When it comes to teaching, he doesn't know how to do it. He may understand math himself, but the way that he teaches it leaves everyone utterly confused. I know that it wasn't just me that wasn't getting the material because the whole class was completely clueless every day. I had to teach myself all the material and spent hours learning it at home",0
Very funny but a horrible teacher. He does not teach just tells you what to look at in the book. Very messy on the board and jumps from one thing to another. I cried after every test but huge curves if the whole class does bad. I'd say if you have a good background in physics you'll be fine but if you're shaky with the stuff don't take.,0
"Extremely slow on grading and handing back assignments. Lectures that have good information, but you have to wade through the extraneous ramblings. Your project will require much time and many components, but it won't be until 6 weeks in that you can even start. By the time you are cleared for interviews and other methods, you will be rushed.",1
"Lois is a good teacher, but not great. I found her to be a rather difficult grader and did not give great feedback. I did find her lectures to be great, her guests very good, and I did enjoy the class. The use of D2L was a bit much as well, and added to the confusion more than helped it.",0
Mrs. Romani is by far one of the best teachers Ive had at ccc. She taught me how to come out of my shell. If I didnt have her idk where Id be right now. She taught me to believe in myself and that hard work always pays off. This class was so much fun. I felt like I was in gym class all over again. If you are a hpe major take her. Not bad to look at,1
You have to teach yourself in order to pass this class. He communicates terribly and even his TAs have no idea what is going on. He only does two examples of questions during lectures that dont even make sense with whats going on. You need the book in order to teach yourself if you want to pass.,0
"I took this class as an elective to expand my knowledge base and was told the course wasn't too hard. The online grading components of the class are not hard, and the project was really interesting to do. The midterms seem to grade on things which are unimportant, memorization-heavy and don't match with the reading sections. Beware stupid course.",0
"He's going to try to scare you like he's this tough professor in this not so easy to pass course but its all a front. He wants you to pass and as long as you put some sort of effort into the class and ask him questions from time to time, he WILL pass you. Talks about himself a lot but he's very caring and intelligent. You'll learn a lot.",1
"This has been my worst teacher in my time at PCC. Schubert does not teach well at all. He does all the problems and lectures with his back to the class and by the time he turns around, he's completed the whole problem and blocked it. Anytime someone asks for help he either says, you should of learned it in the last math or go to tutoring. TERRIBLE!",0
"Mr. Wells is very thorough and is very interested in the material he teaches. His tests are generated from his lectures and his lectures tend to be fast paced. He jokes around but uses class time wisely. If you miss a lecture, it's somewhat hard to catch up because there's a lot of material covered in each lecture. Great professor overall though.",1
Conta was an amazing professor when I attended class with him back in 2011-2013. Great to see an actual police officer become a professor and have such vast work knowledge/experience but also incorporate it into a lecture format and be able to teach students. I took pretty much all the courses he offered and left LACC with an AA in Criminal Justice,1
"Posted a file that got corrupted and didn't repost till the day of the quiz on it, never answers emails outside of her 1:30 hour office hours. You will hate this class if you expect it to be easy or interesting. If i could give her a zero i would.",0
wonderful teacher,1
"There is no proffesor in UCI who is clearer and easier than her. Easiest class ever, but still learned a lot. No concepts. just memorizations. but memorizations a piece of cake as the exams are almost straight off the practice exams given before the tests.",1
"Mary, while clearly a kind and smart person, assembles her courses from a collection of half-baked ideas for projects. If you want a rigorous geology class where you learn more than you could from reading a few Wikipedia pages, Mary is not for you.",0
This is easily the most boring class I have ever had. She teaches you absolutely nothing. The book we have to purchase is hers so she makes money on it and we are required to do workbooks (1-7 pages of homework) every class. This class is extremely time consuming and a huge waste of time. UI100 should be an easy blow off. Her class is the opposite.,0
"He offers feedback on journal entries and short writing assignments. I dont know why I took this class, I hate writing essays. Also dont take him if youre in a different country but if youre east coast youre chilling. Idk why he made it mandatory to attend class but I just had my camera off and slept. Glad its finally over good freaking bye",1
"She is an okay professor but, she regurgitates information from slides that are from the textbook and doesn't even bother slowing down . Also she relies too much on Sapling Learning for homework which is the worst program to learn from in my opinion. Also she scolds you for not knowing the material so read up,do your best, and pray that you pass.",1
"Attendance isn't mandatory but he doesn't upload any of the powerpoints. A LOT of reading, he assigned 5 books for one semester and we read them all. He grades on a curve but he's really rude. You're not allowed to eat in class, use the restroom or leave early. I would never recommend his class to anyone. Only took it because it was available.",0
"He is old school. He is very personable, but not the best instructor. His test are ridiculously hard, but he grades on such a steep curve that I received a 100% on a test that I missed over 25 questions. I learned enough about the economy to say it wasn't a waste to attend his classes. I would recommend him.",0
"Ummm. He is a really nice guy, but not a good teacher at all. He never writes anything down or explains anything to you. He reads the book in class and expects you to attain information just by reading. Never responds to emails, and he lost my homework (he eventually found it but it was still frustrating). All in all: good person, bad teacher.",0
Every class period was the same and he never seemed enthused about teaching us the material. I was eager to learn about International Economics but having such a disheartening teacher made me resent the course. He's a nice guy but if you want to learn do not take his course(s).,0
DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR. Lots of readings and if you forget to read he takes points off. Only quizzes and half the stuff is not in the readings or talked about in class. One absence is 5 points off your attendance grade which makes a difference. Lectures in a socratic method; basically whatever he wants to talk about that day.,0
"I have never been good at math and I was able to get an A in an online math class! It wasn't easy and I had to spend a lot of time studying, but if it wasn't for his lecture videos and the way he teaches I never would've been that successful. He is also great at answering questions and always responds to emails quickly. He wants you to succeed.",1
"Hard to hear, her slides don't make sense half the time because she doesn't proof read them. If you ask her something she'll tell you that's too advanced for the class and won't answer.",0
"Wow. I don't think I have ever hated a class so much. I dread going to this class every single day. Pearson is a nice lady, and she means well. But she has no idea what she is talking about half of the time. She will assign an essay and be confused on what she assigned. Do not take this teacher.",0
