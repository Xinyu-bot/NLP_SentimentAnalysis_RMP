,AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  Ms. Bridges was one of the least effective teachers that I have ever had.  She often times makes problems way more confusing than they really are because she doesn't understand the material.  Those who did well in the class had previously taken calculus.  Her tests are really tough unless you understand all the concepts.,1.5,5.0,Faith Bridges
,I had to retake this class and this professor made it very easy for the class to pass because he provides sample exams that are just like the exams. I regret not taking him the first time I took this class. He is better than any other.,4.0,2.0,Nikolas Kidonakis
,"The biggest problem is that Dr. Dewald expects an enormous amount of reading and effort for a gened class. Some people say you can don't need to read but you really do. On his tests you have to correctly identify quotes and write an essay. The first two test are easy, but the final you actually need to read to do well. DO NOT TAKE IF YOU CAN CHOOSE",3.0,4.0,Jonathan Dewald
,"I took her online class this past semester. Lots of forum posts in the online class, but helps you understand the short stories and poems. The class greatly improved my writing.",4.0,3.0,Melanie Schnell
,"Ok boys and girls, welcome to college. Shapero's ENF and 111 classes are decent; however, her 112 class is tough. A lot of reading and writing. She's very loving and caring even though it may not seem at times. Shapero is about good writing,""period."" No easy A's. I worked my butt off for an A. She's not big on due dates, and doesn't use book.",4.5,3.0,Sylvie Shapero
,"So I liked the course content even though there'too much reading. Good news! Pop quizzes aren't hard at all. Professor A looked unapproachable and she was sometimes harsh with students. I don't recommend this class, the content was great! but the vibe was just not right.",1.0,3.0,Andrea Tone
,I took anthropology 100 fall quarter. The class was a bit long but it also wasn't everyday. I believe the time spanned over 2 hrs. He is a very interesting guy who always seems to be happy and excited to teach. Material was very interesting but like I said it was hard to continuously pay attention because the class was so long not because of him.,5.0,1.0,David Holliway
,"I love the way Ms. Sexton teaches! I wish I could have her for every class that I take.  She is very understanding that you have a life, and that things happen.  She's also very inspirational and cares about you as more than just another student! Love, love, love her!",5.0,2.0,Treva Sexton
,"Stay away from this class!!! He expects you to be a genius and teaches the class like we're PhD students. Like bro, how do you expect me to prove all of calculus in a one hour test?!?!?",1.0,5.0,Blake Temple
,DIFFICULT class but great professor!!! Really cares about students and always willing to stay late to help u understand material.,5.0,4.0,Laura Gershuni
,The class is very easy if you buy the textbook and follow the powerpoints. She does a good job explaining the material but kids don't pay attention because she is kinda boring. But she gives a lot of extra credit on each test - a 70% or higher was a A. If you put in a little effort and pay attention you will do fine,3.0,2.0,Carolin Schellhorn
,"Great professor! Super nice, intelligent, & sexy! Quizzes are easy, projects are straight forward, and simulations were fun. I love to hear him lecture.",5.0,1.0,Richard Tapia
,"Professor Fazelpour loves to be redundant about the less-important stuff. He will also tell you to write down notes that you already have. He does not use BlackBoard and does not, from my experience, respond to emails. The class is easy and important but I feel he could teach much more effectively.",3.0,2.0,Alireza Fazelpour
,"Do yourself a favor: don't take this class. If you need honors credit, take psychology. He is so bad that he told us that ratemyprofessor is full of students that failed the class and are illiterate. I obviously didn't fail and he was bad enough that I needed to let anyone that is considering his class know that they need to reconsider.",1.0,5.0,Lee Maril

,"Good teaching style, difficult to take the information she teaches and apply to tests without doing 300+ pages of reading.",3.0,4.0,Brenda Lays
,"Dr. Xing was so helpful and patient in teaching us in Orgo 2. When everything had to be quickly switched to online, she did an amazing job.

,"He's really good, and I was able to follow the formulas really well. I really liked the class! He's an easy going teacher and would have a few laughs in them.",4.5,1.0,James West
,"Professor Lowi is an amazing professor. She really cares about her students and is very interested in their opinions. She is very learned about the Middle East and this is what makes her class so interesting. However, she assigns a LOT of readings and is a VERY hard grader.",3.5,4.0,Miriam Lowi
,She gives an unnecessary amount of homework and takes forever to grade it. I always dreaded going to her class but she did cancel quite often.,2.0,2.0,Melissa Murata
,"There's no structure to her class. Classes are like coffee shop, feminist book discussions. There's nothing probing your thoughts. It really just feels like I was part of a big book club. If that's your thing go for it.",2.0,2.0,Kristy Odelius
,"She's a great professor. Grade relies heavily on participation in class. Some online reading modules required, but you have all semester to do them. One individual essay, one group project that takes up a good portion of the semester, and a group essay for that project. She gives individual grades so don't worry if your partner isn't great.",4.0,3.0,Lisa Michals
,"Great Professor! I took her for the Summer Pre-calc term Online and it was so easy. Hw, quizzes, and tests are all done on MyMathLab. She lets you use one notecard on the Midterm, and two notecards on the Final which is really helpful because you can jot down notes/formulas. Responds to emails really quickly and is there for you if you need her.",5.0,2.0,Wendy E. Bush
,"Mr. Carson is hands down a great professor. He genuinely cares about his students and their well-beings. There are a couple of group projects and papers to write, but nothing too major. All grades are averaged together, nothing is weighted. I've taken him for ENGL 1101 and 1102 and I wish I could take him again.",5.0,2.0,Alfred Carson
,Lots of readings. One of the worst professors I've had at AU. While the readings are interesting there is no deep discussion and you don't get helpful feedback. ,1.5,5.0,Jocelyn McCarthy
,"Professor Brown is one of my favorite teachers I have had at U of O. He was helpful, engaged in class discussion, encouraged creative thinking, exposed us to a variety of ideas and opinions, and somehow made our class feel like a giant family at the end of ten weeks. He was amazing, I would recommend him to anyone who wants to grow as a person.",5.0,3.0,Kirby Brown
,I really enjoyed this class! A lot of information was provide and we explored a variety of techniques.,5.0,1.0,Joe Micallef

,"I took Mr. Camp for EH 101 and 102 and I dont recomend him for either. He isnt very clear on what hes grading for and he didnt give any feedback. Extremely tough grader, almost impossible to get an A. Do not take it unless youre trying to make your GPA go down bc thats all this class si good for.",1.0,5.0,Sherman Camp
,"Hardest class I've taken so far, but the professor is straight to the point. If you even LOOK lost she will do anything to help you understand the material. Her lectures are highly important in order for you to pass the course so DO NOT miss class. Everything she lectures is on the tests!",4.5,4.0,Miriam Keller-Perkins
,"Mi-sook expects alot from her students.  She will push you, but she always helped me when I needed it and helped me to refine my craftsmanship.  She can be a little harsh in critiques, but hey, it's a tough world.  The only complaint I have is that she makes students write in critiques.",5.0,5.0,Mi Sook Hur
,HE MADE ME FALLIN INLOVE WITH CHEMISTRY!!LOVE HIM!!,5.0,4.0,Ariel Fenster
,"Class isn't too hard, but its definitely not easy either, and you still learn a lot",5.0,3.0,Mark Ams
,She is a director and not very knowledgeable about acting and movement. She plays videos from a website and tells students to copy the moves. The vocal warm-ups are also copied from papers. Basically she doesn't have the necessary education and experience. Don't take her classes.,1.0,3.0,Stefanie Sertich
,Very caring and understanding professor reviews multiple times one main topics. make sure you don't miss too many classes that's the only thing that will fail you other than that great professor would definitely reccomend.,5.0,3.0,Hector Velarde

,"He is a beautiful creature and incredibly nice! He's very clear with his explanation and encourages everyone to engage with each other hence why it's a Marketing course. I just didn't like how we needed to group ourselves the 2nd class because we hardly knew anyone but it is a good way of exercising networking skills. Also, doesn't post his notes.",4.0,2.0,Raymond Lavoie
,"He is an alright teacher.  His talks can be boring, but he breaks it up with interesting videos or real world things he notices.  He def knows his econ. He's also flexible and understanding.",3.5,2.0,Tim Schilling

,Shes one of the nicest teachers here and is very flexible. Love her,4.0,3.0,Lakesha Moore
,I learned a lot about art and myself taking this class.  Mi-Sook is a nice person and knows her stuff.  She pushes you to do your best which sometimes stresses you out.  She's honest and tells you if your project sucks.  Expect to spend time and money on every project.  BE PREPARED TO MISS SLEEP WHILE TAKING THIS CLASS. Take if dedicated to art.,3.5,3.0,Mi Sook Hur
,"Dr. Ptak does a great job at getting you to think about the lesson in new and interesting ways - and he's a great, approachable, and caring person too. Class was fun and engaging, and I really learned to think more carefully and analytically about my thought process. That said, I wish the class was more organized and that he graded faster.",5.0,1.0,Corey Ptak
,"Melanie was an amazing prof for English 100. There were lots of readings and forum posts in the course and four essays. It was not lecture heavy.

I highly recommend taking a class with her if you can!",5.0,4.0,Melanie Schnell
,"Easy A, she tells you exactly what you want. She is understanding and fun",4.0,2.0,Tammy McCullough

,"He gives quizzes every week worth only 1% of your mark that let you know your weak areas. If you spend time only studying the material for the quizzes where you didn't score 100%, you'll ace this class. He doesn't care about attendanceparticipation.",3.5,2.0,Mark Buchner
,I LOVE this man. I go to his office (he's also my advisor) just to talk to him and end up spending way too long there. Not only is he helpful but he also is such a fascinating lecturer. He can show you the other side of any issue. Highly recommended!,5.0,3.0,Rick Werner
,"Not clear with the syllabus. Does not hand back graded assignments. Skips through power points and says it will be posted on blackboard but never is. Is not willing to listen to students talk in class, kind of speaks over them.",2.0,4.0,Dennis Bogdan
,"He was a funny guy and kept things interesting.  He puts his notes online so you can follow them during lecture.  That being said, going to lecture is a good idea because sometimes he veers from his written notes.  I liked him.",4.0,2.0,Peter Wejksnora
,"Mr. Stagg is by far one of the toughest professors I've had. He gives a lot of papers, homework, and groupwork. On the plus side, he certainly helped improve my writing skills and knowledge of citations (so. many. citations.) As for his personality, he's a but rude and loud.",3.0,5.0,Kevin Stagg
,"This class is easy! There is not a lot of work to do in this class besides the workbook activity, interview, and some quizzes. You can work ahead if you take it online and finish way before the semester ends.",5.0,1.0,Paula Heller Garland

,"I took this class thinking it would be easier than some of the other options I had. It was not. If you are into astronomy, this class is perfect for you. If you are just trying to get credit, take something else. Cooney is a great professor, it is just a very hard class.",4.0,5.0,James Cooney

,"This man is the worst professor I have ever encountered. Disorganized, wild tangents about Nazis and Eugenics, and ""jokes"" that would probably get a student a one-on-one meeting with the dean. Stay as far away from this guy as you can. Tests and finals used to be easy, but he had instructions from admin to change them, now they're super difficult.",1.0,5.0,Stephen O'Leary
,nice guy but his stroies go off track and get out of hand while he is teaching.Some stories do not even seem so true.Supposeldy he has been to college everyhwere.He is a married man with a young daughter but always comments about beautiful women he has seen.I just think thats a bit strange-runs slow on notes bc stories way too long.,3.0,3.0,Wade Watkins
,"Lectures/discussions are mandatory, attendance will be taken. Exams are easy as she gives a complete study guide with all of the material on it, just memorize. Papers are graded rather harshly (especially the first one). They look for a very specific format for the papers and it is up to you to figure out what that is.",3.0,4.0,Elizabeth Roberts
,"Really, really cool dude. Super chill and makes class fun. The work throughout the class I thought was a complete waste. Didn't take anything away from the course, but that had to do with the course, not Eddie. He was an awesome professor and made this class semi-bearable.",5.0,1.0,Eddie Paje

,Gilbert is a clear professor. Delivers material in concise and coherent fashion. Weekly quizs were somewhat difficult in my experience. Written portion easy multiple choice not so. Help in class not so out of class. Difficult to get certain info from him. Only answers course questions. Not sympathetic to mental health needs. Good reading material.,3.0,4.0,Michael Gilbert
,"Dr. McConkey is a darling. Keeps things clear and interesting, keeps things balanced between student participation and lecture, and clarifies difficult concepts. Not at all difficult if you read and pay attention. He doesn't take himself too seriously either. And while he's not ""hot"" per-se, he's just so endearing you can't help but love him.",4.5,2.0,Dale Edwin McConkey
,"I took Professor Gibson for Creative Writing and for the Octavia Spencer Selective Authors Course.

She has seen me through sicknesses, broken bones, and struggles! She never gave up on me.",5.0,1.0,Ebony Gibson
,"Dr. Brown is hilarious, so listening to his lectures was never a challenge. The class was extremely easy, although he was a very slow grader and our grades were a bit unclear. If you ask for individual help, he's very nice and takes the extra time out to speak with students one on one. I could tell he was passionate about what he was teaching.",4.0,1.0,Ryan Brown
,He is my favorite prof at CSUSM so far! He is so smart and is really passionate about what he teaches! His lectures are almost fun to listen to because he makes them so interesting and usually adds funny memes and videos. He is very clear about his expectations. There are only 2 tests and 1 five page paper. He gives very detailed study guides!,5.0,3.0,Ibrahim Al-Marashi

When I asked her what I could improve on, she gave vague answers.",1.5,4.0,Saralina Kamholtz-Roberts

,"For me I think I didn't enjoy this class only because of his teaching style. I attended every class, but it still didn't help. A lot of what you learn is based on the homework which is hard to learn from because it's all online on Wiley. He takes some of the questions from Wiley and puts them in his exams so use that for practice if you have him.",3.0,4.0,Dave Barrett

,"Experienced, but sloppy & lazy at teaching. He reads off his many slides. Cuts off student questions and can't answer them clearly. Many errors on tests. Wording of questions are confusing & vague. Likes to be chummy with students. Material is tough. You will have to teach yourself from the textbook and put in A LOT of your own time to do well.",1.0,3.0,Garyen Chong

,"Brett will go out of his way to not help you when you need help. I spent a month trying to arrange a mandatory meeting because I can't make his office hours, he never once suggested a time. Passive aggressive about my EXCUSED absentees until he tried to fail me because of them. Avoid unless your a perfectionist who can stay on his good side.",2.0,5.0,Bret Keeling
,"Not a bad teacher. Don't listen to the other reviews. Just do the work with a friend, read the course reader it's a big help! The final is 50% of the grade but you get a SG/Mockfinal/and a 8x11 cheat sheet. She sometimes gives EC. Just put in the effort trust me, don't copy the work with a friend actually try to understand it and you will do fine",4.0,3.0,Melodie Hallett
,"He takes time to ensure students are understanding the concepts, formulas and logic by giving as many examples as possible.

,"This Professor is disrespectful, unprofessional, condescending and mediocre. I did not learn anything from this class, she is more interested in hearing her self speak and repeating irrelevant information in the third person rather than if her students understand.

,"Very easy class. By far the easiest multiple-choice I've ever had in college and all of the essay questions are given well in advance.

",3.5,2.0,Eric De Vos
,"She always hands out updated deadlines for assignments. Assignments are typically very simple. Expect to do group work. Expect to have a big powerpoint/paper at end of class in place of a final. Good instructor, she has lots of career experience. I would recommend her/take her again.",5.0,1.0,Peggy Murnighan
,"Lectures are a bit scripted and note-taking usually becomes quite laborious, especially if you phase out for a bit.

,"One of the most interesting classes I have ever taken.  It challenged and changed the way I view medicine, and beyond.  Roberts is a solid professor, but i was really my GSI who clarified and taught me the material.  There is ~80pg/week of reading, which is dense.  Several papers, and two exams.  This class is a LOT of work, but totally worth it.",3.5,4.0,Elizabeth Roberts

,"Although she's a really nice person, I would never take her class again. Lectures are very boring and all over the place.

Would not recommend.",1.0,2.0,Francine Dagenais
,"Super nice, and a great teacher. Her class was a lot of fun, and not terribly difficult.",5.0,2.0,Lisa Loberg
,"Super nice and helpful, easy to understand, knows the subject very well, but don't ever expect to get out of class early. If you get through all the material for the day she'll go back and review for the remaining 5 minutes or 50 minutes, because she wants students to get their money worth. Having Devito for K helped a lot with my success in Sales.",5.0,4.0,Judy Clausen

,"Rossi is my department head and is the most unorganized human being I've ever seen.  His lectures revolve only around social mobility, and he  emails readings sometimes an hour before they're due.

Just go to his office.",5.0,4.0,Mark O'Gorman

My only gripe with his class is that his syllabus was a bit unorganized so I always had a hard time figuring out when things were due.",4.0,2.0,John Doyle

,"Gives helpful feedback on assignments. Very patient and positive attitude towards students. Main drawback to this class was the massive amount of reading, especially workshopping up to 19 other students in the class, 3 times over the semester, giving detailed feedback on each piece. Added to the time spent on your own work, it takes several hours.",4.0,1.0,Melanie Schnell
,"Her civic class was the hardest thing ever and I don't know why it is only 3 credits for the amount of work it asks for. This is not an easy A class by any means, she's a though grader.

,"She's a harsh grader and will fail you if you skip too often. I don't feel as though she taught us much about writing or becoming a better writer. She is very liberal and most of her assignments and lectures revolve around society and feminism. Overall, try to find another professor with more experience because her class was very disappointing.",1.0,4.0,Melissa Murata
,"Brilliant, fantastic professor. My mind was blown daily. Interesting, thought provoking lectures that worked cohesively with the equally interesting readings she assigned. Very strict about being on facebook on laptops, but it actually helped me pay attention. If you have any interest in the health field, take this class, or a class with her.",5.0,4.0,Elizabeth Roberts
,"I understand that online classes are probably hard to teach, but she was totally AWOL the whole time. I emailed her four times during the class, and she never once got back to me. She would fix and change things but never communicate at all. The class is graded (often outdated) busywork, more time consuming than chemistry or calculus.",1.0,2.0,Janet Rowell
,"Terrific instructor. You will learn so much about not only the language, but cultures as well. However her tests are insanely hard and she is a STRICT grader. If you want an easy A or B then don't take her class. Expect tons of hw and long papers in Spanish. That said, she is very interested in her students and will take time to know you.",4.0,4.0,Margarita Casas
,The course has a lot of information. The exams are a majority of your grade so be sure to study ! Her exams are based off her lectures. Powerpoints are posted. I would recommend making a quizlet based off her powerpoints and study. Definitely an Easy A if you study.,4.0,3.0,Lauren Mavica
,"His high degree of knowledge shows through every lecture, and he is good at clarifying complicated subjects. However I find he is very critical, and when asking questions aloud in class he seems to only accept the one answer he had been waiting to hear.",4.0,4.0,Danny O'Quinn
,"this class is easy. I never showed up and almost got an A. there's lots of reading but you can skim through it and understand. I did not enjoy his class AT ALL, how much he talks about himself or off topic conversations in class is ridiculous and the reason why I stopped attending class. Basically taught myself everything I needed.",2.0,1.0,David Seymour
,"I really enjoyed the class I took with Professor Qualls. While I learned a lot, I struggled as well. He gives good feed back on papers, but it's not always clear and is mostly negative.

,He's very repetitive with notes. He also requires you to buy the textbook which is not necessary at all. We used the textbook once to do a homework assignment and that was all. He will give you review outlines for the two test and final and they clearly tell you what you need to know. Do not miss a single class.,4.0,3.0,Alireza Fazelpour
,"Dr. Fazelpour is an amazing professor. Spends extra time with students after class to ensure they understand. spend in total writing 80+ program but most are just copying code with some homework; working in pair. Test cover question from the book, a lot the question are the same as the given study guide.",5.0,4.0,Alireza Fazelpour
,"I attended every lecture and took notes, but pretty much taught myself everything. It was difficult because the professor was not clear nor helpful. To be honest, he didn't seem that enthusiastic about teaching nor did he show genuine care for his students. If I could retake the class, I would choose a different professor.",1.0,3.0,George Vlachos

,"I took Mrs. Ryburn for Precal and she was a good teacher, definitely the best percal teacher at Arkansas.

Only 4 tests all year and she tells you everything on them.",4.0,3.0,Victoria Ryburn
,"I love Professor Carson so much. I took him for ENGL 1101 and 1102 because he is so sweet and cares so much about your success. Lots of reading and quizzes on what you read but he always goes over EXACTLY what is on the quiz. His classes are small so he will know YOU, do not skip class. His humor is underappreciated. Easy in-class essays! TAKE HIM!",5.0,2.0,Alfred Carson
,"Hi everyone. I am not usually rated for any of my professors. However, I think you need to know about this one. Homework is extremely heavy. Making sure you have time for it.

,Fowler is totally disorganized. Class discussions are rambling and unplanned and it's not clear what you're supposed to get from them. Class is almost entirely digression. Horribly unstructured.,1.0,2.0,Elizabeth Fowler
,"I found this class so interesting. It's definitely not for everybody, but the information discussed was stuff I had never even thought about, before. It's a lot of reading, but interesting reading. Professor Aizura is funny and definitely does his best to make his lectures interesting. 1 paper, 6 reflections, a group project, and a final exam.",3.0,2.0,Aren Aizura
,"Although Conrad does give a lot of hw (online and in textbook), the material she assigns actually helps understanding the concepts and prepare you for her exams.

,"My favorite class by far!! Obviously, if you don't pay attention or take notes you most likely will not pass. But Mr. Z makes his notes very clear to understand and seems to enjoy in-class conversation about the topic at hand rather than only dictating the course with zero student input. He also makes everything accessible online. Fast grader too.",5.0,3.0,Marc Zamkotowicz

,"Professor Hetrick is a nice enough and good teacher but he is not an easy ""A"" or ""B"". You have FOUR 5 Page Essays and a FINAL that's like a FIFTH Paper all graded on every possible rule of grammar. Like not enough or too many commas gets you minus 10 points! There are a couple of EASIER ENGLISH Professors there on campus so please find one!!!",4.0,5.0,Kyle Hetrick
,It was a pleasure to have Kata for SPAN224 this semester. She tried her best to make the class minimally stressful and did a wonderful job demonstrating her knowledge of the material.

,By far the best professor I've had. She's so sweet and very very smart. Definitely cares if you make a good grade but not to a point where it's pushy or annoying. We only did four speeches and she tries to make them as easy as possible. Quizzes and tests are easy if you engage in the lectures and read the book (which is simple). Definitely a fave!,5.0,3.0,Raquel Polanco
,"He was one of the BEST professors I have EVER taken at Hofstra. He was sooo passionate about sociology and an extremely smart mad. He was funny as hell and had the class laughin everyday.

,"He's a very nice polite man. It's too bad his lectures were very boring and sorta awkward at moments. I'm not sure I would take him to learn or have him as a mentor because he's very black & white & goes by what's given. Class was very easy though. He allowed a typed cheat sheet for exams, curves a lot, and kind of an easy grader. DON'T BUY BOOK!",5.0,1.0,Jiming Wu
,"KB was amazing, super fun and inspirational. If help was needed, he went out of his way to help. He might have assigned a lot of reading, but all the work assigned was interesting and fun to read.

,After reading reviews on here I was scared to take his class. Glad I took it though. He's an amazing professor. Read syllabus before asking questions. He responds quickly. 3 assignments each week.

Get ready to read the entire textbook and teach yourself!",1.0,2.0,Heather Poole

Overall, a fantastic professor, I would highly recommend to anyone.",4.5,4.0,Anna Teekell

I'm a slow reader and some were very dense.",4.0,4.0,Alexander Tulin

Really a great guy and teacher.",4.5,3.0,Frank McLaughlin
,"She is very nice and extremely helpful. She had help sessions for us before our final exam and essay. She also would send sources that she thought would be good for your essay directly to you.

,Great professor that is very knowledgeable and engaged in the topic. Loves class discussions and loves to present questions that challenge your thoughts. Class was easy as long as you did the 10 page reading assignments that were given here and there and show up and participate. Would for sure take again!,5.0,1.0,Peter Kanetis
,"He's a nice guy and knows his stuff; however, not cut out for teaching. Another teacher (head of dept maybe?) sets what he teaches and I feel this is a downfall for him. Teacher needs to use his own lessons to teach the required information. If you actually want to learn something, take a different class. Looking for just a grade? Take his class.",2.5,3.0,Joseph Lee
,"Professor Taylor is very knowledgable and it is obvious he enjoys teaching. He is easily accessible outside of class and willing to help. Midterms and exams were fair, as is his grading. A portion of your final grade is based off of attendance and class participation. Pay attention in class and stay on top of readings and you'll do well.",5.0,3.0,Andrew Taylor
,"I loved Professor Roberts. She was tough but I was always engaged in her class. I learned a lot and also think I was able to improve my writing skills. Papers are tough, would recommend utilizing the GSIs who are amazing. Exams are blue books with a study guide of potential terms and prompts, and relatively easy. Tough but worth it.",5.0,4.0,Elizabeth Roberts
,He is a very tough grader and attendance is mandatory. Arriving a minute or two after class begins gives you an entire absence. His tests are easy if you study. If you are taking this class because you like Shakespeare be prepared to take in a lot of visual performances and analysis not only reading. You read about a play per 2 class periods.,2.0,4.0,Bradley Ryner

,"I truly enjoyed having Zheng as a professor as a person. However, I found her grading to be extremely unregulated and critiques weren't given until after the next project was due.

Course had potential to be amazing, but Prof. Tone was not very present nor compassionate.",2.5,4.0,Andrea Tone
,"She is a nice person but I found her ineffective as a prof. Very confusing, as she seems to go in circles with her explanations and will never give you a straight forward answer. I highly recommend the textbook as that is the only way I learnt anything, I taught myself the entire lecture. She was defensive when I voiced my confusion. Unapproachable",1.0,4.0,Barbara Sander

Sometimes his expectations are not 100% clear on assignments. His discussions in class are great.",3.0,3.0,David Newhouse
,Very very hard class. Professor Alse seems like a really smart guy but is not a very good teacher at all. His in class lectures are just all over the place and are really hard to follow I had an easier time understanding the material by reading the book.  His tests are extremely difficult be prepared to study all day and all night before the test.,2.5,5.0,Johnny Alse
,Professor Fan is an amazing professor! She repeats herself a lot but it's to make sure that you understand what she's teaching and it's LIKELY that the things she repeats are going to be on the exams. HW is easy. She offers study guides so do them! Offers 4% of extra credit. Not a tough grader when it comes to the case study.,5.0,2.0,Qin Fan
,I enjoyed my class with Dr. Currier. She's clearly passionate about micro and enjoys teaching. She broke up lecture by having small group questions (not projects or anything) to help review. Definitely recommend the e-book and using the quizzes in it to study. She gives you extra credit for doing them as well. Tests are pretty difficult.,4.0,4.0,Angela Currier

,"Robert Ruder is the worst professor I have taken at Gonzaga. His classes are so boring! Sometimes he'll lecture on and on without making a real connection to what we are learning in the class. Also, this is a class on business information systems, but you don't even learn how to create one! He doesn't even teach, he assigns readings and that's it.",1.5,3.0,Robert Ruder

,"Extremely rude (condescending) to students. I've had plenty of bad teachers, but her level of disrespect is far above any other. She reads off slides created by a TA & HW that is way beyond the scope of the course. Exams are long and confusing. Only thing she cares about are her stories (football talk) during the 1st 30mins. Don't take if possible.",1.0,5.0,Kathleen Rankin

,"Class was so great, I am actually taking him again for 1302.  Being present for the class is key, he prefers to tell the information as a story.

Highly recommend.",5.0,4.0,Adam Gerritsen
,"Although she may not always be clear when it comes to how she wants things, she's helpful and super sweet. As long as you attend class and she sees you're putting in effort, she'll definitely help you. The textbook (pdf) can be found online but the AP stylebook is a must. You'll use it in other classes too. She's the advisor of BB too by the way.",5.0,3.0,Kathy Jesse
,"She grades more on English than the content of the class. You write a paper including all of the information needed but she doesn't like your delivery you get a D automatically.

,Almost never showed up to class & still got an A in her class. There's a huge project during the entire semester that's not hard. Quizzes are chances for you to get extra points on the test. She opens up the study guide at the beginning of the unit so you have time to fill it out. It's also a bonus she's super sweet & knows what she's talking about,5.0,2.0,Jayme Feagin

,"Honestly a really smart guy and tries to share his knowledge through teaching. His class isn't hard at all just pay attention do the HWs (very few) maybe you'll get a nice take home test/quiz if you convince him that's what we did, and his tests aren't hard as all he'll tell you random ass stories through the test and class all day long.",5.0,2.0,Brian Hurley

Plus He's never said anything about me being high in class :)",5.0,2.0,MO Trout
,"Took this class online without a lecture. Insanely easy. One hour of homework a week and then 3 open book exams, and one easy project.

I only took this class cause it meets an upper-div for my major.",2.0,4.0,Jun Wu

I've never liked public speaking, but her feedback and welcoming classroom environment made it easier! Highly recommend!",5.0,2.0,Cailyn Noland
,"She's extremely entitled. She says she is 'strict' under the guise of just being relatively self-important. I say this because she doesn't listen enough to her own students & demeans them. In a speech class, where students have to speak even when they have social anxieties, why is a professional in the subject demoralizing and degrading them?",2.5,4.0,Susan Mulligan-Heckler
,"Very passionate about the material and you will always know what is expected of you. Very fair grader and is also understanding of family/health issues.

Other then that she is nit picky about grading.",3.0,4.0,Julie Beaty-Nosco

,Prof Hurley is a great professor who makes Accounting a fun subject to learn! Comes up with little tricks to make sure you understand the content. Goes off topic a bit but tells funny stories. Midterm/Final and participation in class that make up the grade. Attendance not mandatory as long as you do the work! If you want to learn though show up!,5.0,3.0,Brian Hurley
,"I'm not sure about the course IRL but online it was terrible. The entire course was automated (all assignments, quizzes, and lectures were uploaded from the start) and the only way we could contact our teacher was through email.

His witty comments and helpful critiques make him a wonderful professor and I would recommend him highly!",4.5,3.0,Lyle Kissack
,"Eran Makover should not be teaching precalc. Anyone who is going into a math heavy major, avoid this professor at all costs.

Pick any professor besides him for math.",1.0,5.0,Eran Makover

,"You're back in high school with Rankin. Does not help you at all, just says it's test material and she can't comment on it, even though it's in class and not an exam day.

,"I never took chemistry when I was in high school, but I understood it just fine. If you attend the lectures and answer questions, he makes it pretty easy to understand.

She also let me makeup a discussion question.",5.0,3.0,Mary Louis
,"His assignments are easy, but he will challenge you.  He is one of those professors who lays out arguments and presents counterarguments while very infrequently telling his own opinions.

She also gets off topic, and makes class hard to follow.",1.5,4.0,Faith Bridges

,"Midterm: 30%, final: 40%. Most people skip lecture as it's hard to follow - read textbook instead. Quite tough on partial credit on exams. That said, he tests on less than the material covered and is clearly a very fair grader who cares about students succeeding (also has no curve, but drops lowest quiz and HW). TA is incredibly helpful.",3.0,4.0,Murli Gupta
,"I liked Dr. Teekell a lot but she was a tough grader, a lot of my friends got an easy A in their first year writing seminar.

,"The kind of professor that won't give an A. She was helpful when I needed it, but she could be very hot or cold.

,"Matt is an absolutely fantastic lecturer. I looked forward to coming to this class every day. However, if you're not good at sitting through lectures, this might not be the course for you.

Pros: She is looking in the best interest of the student, and she gives lots of opportunities for extra credit",3.5,2.0,Huiying Chen
,"The class is based purely on what is verbally said. There are no powerpoints or notes she uses. You come to class and you take notes on what she says.

Coming to class is vital to your grade.",3.0,3.0,Anna Amundson

Half-way through our quarter, there were 11 students out of 30 with over 100% and the bulk of us had over 90% because of his steep curve. Marsh really cares about students. Grade is a final, a group project, a lab project, and six quizzes.",5.0,4.0,Jamey Marsh

,"Not much things from lectures got correct on exam. I literally recorded his lecture. If you fall behind people in areas where others did well, you will regret it.

(I recommend Khan Academy) She's Hurtful!",1.0,5.0,Karen Goodwin
,She is not the best. She just reads through the book. Loves group projects. She reviews at the end of the chapters and before tests.

,"I have mixed feelings about Professor Horan. I loved him up until finales week. It's an easy class as long as you turn in the assignments, but I ended up having technical difficulties near the end and almost failed because he wouldn't be understanding so-- ehhh. Overall liked him more then I didn't.",3.0,1.0,Thomas Horan
,"Alex is the best TA at Pitt. Comes to recitation with a perfectly planned course that covers exactly what is going to be on the quiz. She is right to the point on how to complete the questions, and gives you clear guided steps on how to solve any problem. She also hosts pre-test study sessions all day the day before. Super helpful.",5.0,1.0,Alex Yarosh
,"Professor Lorentz is a great teacher, and very effective at his job. He responds to e-mails in a timely fashion, and although you are required to do the reading to get a good grade, it isn't too much to ask considering assignments and essays are broad enough that even a rudimentary understanding of the content should suffice. Took the online class.",4.0,2.0,Kevin Lorentz
,"Professor Warden was a great teacher. She made the class interesting. She was a fair grader and as long as you do the assignment how it says to, you get a good grade. No final or other tests. Would DEFINITELY recommend her course. ",4.5,2.0,Tonya Warden
,This class was useless. It was an absolute waste of time. It took time away from my family and now that I am student teaching many of the master teachers I have talked about this class to have found her assignments outdated and laughable. Best of luck on your 10 day science unit outline. You will never ever use that again.,2.0,5.0,Allison Arnold
,"Bertha is a really nice lady and the class wasn't too hard at all. She can be unclear in her instructions, and she will say things are in the book when they aren't. You do have to stay on top of her for your grades though! She gave half the class an IP while she took her time grading finals, which messed with financial aid.",3.0,3.0,Bertha Kondrak
,Really great teacher and easy to do well if you follow directions and stay on top of your work.,4.5,3.0,Bret Keeling

So unorganized, rude, gives tests that have the hardest problems! DONT TAKE HIM!!!",1.0,5.0,Eric Crumpler
,If youve had the pleasure of being in Dr. Gs class you know she is such a sweetheart. She truly cares about her students and works at a pace to make sure everyone understands the material (mainly just reading sheet music).

,"Dr. Schore is too phenomenal to not take. Just look at his review, all excellent reviews. His lecture are the most clear Ive ever taken in Davis. I even recommend you to take his 118A instead of 8A since he is sooo great. Learning will be fun for once if you try his class.",5.0,4.0,Neil Schore

If want to understand finance take his class!,5.0,4.0,Kenneth Leung
,"very good math professor, he wants us to learn so much about math proofs in each class, so it's really hard to follow and absorb the material sometimes, since it's also too abstract.  Professor is prefect, the only thing is that I am not smart/hardworking  enough to keep pace. But if you want to learn pure math, that's the correct man to follow. ",5.0,5.0,Charles Rezk
,"He is a good guy with a genuine interest and expertise in the field. But he makes you work for the grade, he has a mix of group projects, class discussions and lectures. He speaks relatively slow and spends a lot of time on a small quantity of topics. ",3.0,4.0,Casey Kleindienst
,Its a class that makes you work mentally. There are a TON of dense 30-50 pg readings almost overnight. You need to read them to understand what is discussed in class. I almost failed the class and but worked hard and passed with a breeze. Danny is an AWESOME guy. He does however take forever to reply to emails. I would recommend the class.,5.0,4.0,Daniel Burridge
,He is really passionate about the subject which makes it more enjoyable. He types out all notes in word document on the screen which makes it easy to read and understand.

Definitely recommend!,4.0,3.0,Marc Zamkotowicz

,"Tough class for sure! He is straight forward and comes off as intimidating, but once you get his personality then it isn't so bad . ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS.

,"I had him for dual credit History 2nd sem. of high school online. I work diligently and yet..on one paper I received 3 pts out of 40.

,"I took him for Ultimate Questions and he made a religious class more open and discussion based, which was good for people who weren't religious. He depended on the books for his lectures and his tests, but he gave funny and romantic stories with his lectures. It is hard to know when it take notes due to the stories, but just write down the concepts",4.0,3.0,Hoon Choi
,She is more than willing to help you during her office hours. At times in class she seemed to be impatient when a concept was not grasped within a 24hr period.

,"Not bad, not great. Lectures are just cut-and-paste PP presentation's of the readings. Class is an easy A if you go to class, take notes, and write a good paper. If you need an easy GenEd, take Olsson. If you're looking for more in-depth study of the subject, look elsewhere.",3.5,2.0,Anna Olsson

,I took her on line nutrition class and it was a lot of work but not terribly difficult.  A lot of writing.

She's funny and knows her stuff. I learned a lot.,4.5,3.0,Carolyn Holcroft
,"Took this class online. Was kinda confusing to me, but Professor McLawhon has outlines for you to follow to help clarify things.

Will use them when you take the final exam.",4.0,3.0,Ryan McLawhon

Overall a great professor,5.0,2.0,Disa Cornish
,"OKay let me just say that going to his office hours literally saved y life and cleared my skin. He has a way of making you feel like a genius, and making difficult topics make complete sense. Also he always asks you how youre doing and genuinely cares about your answer. He wants you to do well, just go and ask for help, you will literally get an A.",5.0,3.0,Corey Ptak
,"THE best english teacher I have ever had. We had three papers the whole semester, and the rest of the time is just him lecturing.

,"Prof. O'Gorman was more than helpful during the entire class.  I travel for leisure and missed a few classes and he understood that life happens and ensured that I did the work but I was able to understand the work and stay up with the information.

A chapter quiz every Monday, essay quiz every Wednesday, map quiz every Friday  on 15 out of 60 places and both chapter and map quizzes are hard. Her exams are the quizzes. Don't take if you are loaded with courses.",2.5,4.0,Linda Pittman
,"DJB is kind, welcoming to questions, and gives great examples. Beware of cold-calling. She told funny stories about her husband relating to accounting. She really knew her stuff.

,"The class was fun. Prof. Goldner a bit of an awkward lecturer, but he clearly knows his stuff. He assigned 4 (pretty interesting) books to read, and you need to write a short essay for each of them, but he drops the lowest grade and grades pretty nicely, so you can get away with skipping one if need be. Tests are mostly multiple choice. Easy A.",4.0,2.0,Erik Goldner
,"I was scared to take ACCT 2010, but professor Richards made it fun, easy to understand and my favorite class. I am excited to take the next Accounting class from him!!! He teaches at 7:30 and I am NOT a morning person but waking up for his class is worth it!",5.0,2.0,James Richards

,"Dr. Lim is a knowledgeable prof. Notes were clear. However, he is incapable of teaching or getting anything across. Took him in the summer, and it was painful to watch his lectures to get somewhere since he focuses on things that dont matter. His midterms were okay. Final was natural selection. Advice: dont take him unless you absolutely have to",1.0,5.0,Phooi Lim
,Prof Shine is a very nice and kind man. He does tend to get off topic easily but he is very sweet and cares about his students and the content he teaches.

,Professor Snaza is absolutely fantastic. He is completely understanding and grants extensions easily if you have a good reason to request one. There is a fair amount of reading but you can get away with not doing sometimes (he likes you if you participate often). Grading is tough but he gives great feedback and allows for re-writes.,5.0,3.0,Nathan Snaza
,"Because Lamkin was an assistant professor, I didn't really have much experience with her. But from what I  experienced, she is a seemingly good professor.

I'd be happy to hear how others like the new Honors program being started at Mission next semester.",5.0,1.0,Diane Lamkin
,"i do not understand how she has 100% rate on taking her again as a professor. She is very tough and treats her students like they do not know anything. Only she does.

,Professor Carter is one of the best professors at Columbia but you have to work hard.  She does not give to many quizzes . You will have to present a group case study and write a research paper.

,Professor Meehan's class is pretty boring but the material you get from the class is more than what she provides on the outlines.  Her tests are straight forward but only study what she talked about in class.  Wouldn't even recommend getting the textbook because she narrows down what you need to know.,1.0,3.0,Anita Meehan
,Prof. Chase was easily the best professor Ive had at MJC so far. His lectures are interesting whether youre into astronomy or not.

The weekly quizzes are a breeze if you study the notes he gives!,5.0,3.0,Daniel Chase
,"Let me be clear about myself, this is by far the easiest professor I've ever had.

,"Professor Nelson's class was well organized, entertaining, and very interesting.  His lectures are awesome, and he tells you the exact information that you need to know.

,"Math sucks. Let's be honest. But Professor Ryburn makes math suck a lot less. She is extremely helpful, nice, and willing to help.

,Took him for the 12 week session over the summer. He is very transparent about what to know for quizzes and exams. Quizzes were usually once or twice a week.

He made an often dreaded class enjoyable.,5.0,3.0,Ivie Stein
,"As a first semester class, it's hard to tell what is expected. Going from nothing to understanding circuit diagrams and binary assembly instructions for a PIC, it really is a testament to the quality of Dr. Duba's teaching. He can be quite fun, but that is his main drawback- he is not the best professor at keeping random side conversions in check.",5.0,3.0,Charles Duba
,"As far as the lecture is concerned Mrs Rogers is a great teacher, she knows her stuff. However, this course is by far one of the least modern in the uni there are far too many components you're graded by and making a tut and lab mandatory with the class is just ridiculous. It's too much mandatory stuff and when you're full time it is terrible!",3.0,3.0,Cerrie Rogers
,"Literally the best professor I have ever had. She is insanely helpful and treats her students like her own children,  If you do myspanishlab and are there for most of the in class tasks, you should have no problems.

He has a wealth of knowledge and if you try you'll be fine.",5.0,4.0,Casey Kleindienst
,"Patrick is honestly one of the best humans on the planet.

But besides that, he has taught me so much & I've enjoyed classes.",4.0,4.0,Sean Evans
,"Horrible experience for Summer Online. Switch to Canvas made everything haywire, but she's really disorganized and seldom emails back.

Shows videos in class and gives extra credit. I'd take her again.",4.0,2.0,Kim Shively
,"If grammar or spelling are a challenge for you, beware she will go after you 1-on-1 & in class. You HAVE to read!! You will not survive the blackboard post or class discussions without it.

The material can be a little difficult at times but she does her best to teach it and you just have to apply yourself like you would for any math class. I would deff take her again!!,4.0,3.0,Carolin Schellhorn
,"Love Dr. Conrad. She is very straightforward, not to be mean or too tough, but realistic and cares about how you do. I wish more professors would lay it out like she does.

,"She is rude and clearly has issues like previously mentioned its sad that she is the only professor teaching the course.

,"Miss Pillai is very responsible and passionate about teaching. The grading is strict I do admit, but that does for the whole French department, no points were taken out of personal favor or so, the rubric was clear. But most importantly, her class is not dull at all, so personally I wouldn't even want to skip this class because it was just SO fun.",5.0,2.0,Guyomar Pillai
,He has a sense of humor which makes the lectures fun. He hands out the lecture notes and test from those so studying is way easier and organized.

,Insanely hard grader on 8 micro-themes and 1 paper worth 25% of your grade. She's very intelligent but expects us all to teach her something new about the Old Testament which is nearly impossible so unless you're willing to devout your whole life to this one class do not expect an easy A. The midterm + final are long and require lots of writing,2.0,4.0,Mary Callaway

,"Does not make expectations clear. First paper almost the whole class received C's.

Even grades low on participation if you are active! I would not recommend her class.",2.0,4.0,Joanne Freed
,"My first impression was that she reminded me of Dolores Umbridge. She pretends to be nice, but is pretty mean. Her assignments are  kind of vague and her lectures go on for hours.

I like the music he chose and the pictures are good.",5.0,4.0,Daniel Deluna

He was a great teacher, if you are prepared to actually learn how to do the math you will have no problem passing his class. the people that drop out and review him poorly did not put the effort in and should not have expected to pass a math class. Good guy, would take again. ",4.5,2.0,David Petro-Roy

Would definitely recommend taking his FYS.",4.0,4.0,Nathan Snaza

,"Dr. Searfoss was always willing to meet with me. One complaint I do have is the grading system- most things are checks, check plus, etc. it's hard to really tell how you're actually doing in the class. All we read was Poe.

,Great teacher. Actually makes it her priority to make sure you learn the material.,5.0,3.0,Nancy Steiner
,"Honestly Prof Nedds class is just a chance to listen to him mumble about art, albeit interesting art, and work on assignments for the class in class because no one pays attention. All the grades come from the textbook which means you don't have to pay attention to the lectures at all you just have to take 5 online quizzes and write 5 essays.",3.0,1.0,Andrew Nedd
,"Great professor. He is exceptionally good at explaining ideas and concepts and is always enthusiastic while delivering them.

,"My favorite teacher at CCNY thus far. She gives great feedback and it's obvious that she wants the best for all her students.

,"Professor Wigginton thrives on torturing students. She goes out of her way to make assignments and quizzes more difficult.

,"I usually dislike theology classes, but Dr. Choi mostly stayed professional and neutral, even when discussing very controversial topics (which you will discuss!)

,"Great teacher. I hadn't taken any classes in law or business before, so I was a little intimidated going into this, but I loved it.

Interesting reading, although, instructor has his own beliefs and the reading shows that. Entire text is on different philosophers beliefs which was unexpected to me. Do work get an A.",4.5,2.0,Arnold Smith
,"Overall, Dr. Lyons is a great prof. If you enjoy Archaeology or if it is your major, you will likely enjoy the breadth of material covered in her course. However, there is an ungodly amount of information crammed into this course and she goes fast. Notes are minimal and no study guide for exams, so be prepared to memorize a lot of material.",3.0,3.0,Diane Lyons
,"Dr. Lim was not the best professor for this class. Avoid him like the plague if you can. I got a 67% on the final and that was the average. There was no curve in the class whatsoever, the only reason I passed was because the TA was amazing and gave a lot of partial credit. Multiple people cried during his final.",1.0,4.0,Phooi Lim
,He is a great teacher who really cares about his students. He is not tech. savvy but is very aware of that and is extremely flexible when you get confused on due dates and assignments which I promise will happen. But he cares about the material and knows so much about the topics from personal experience. so basically take his class if you can.,5.0,3.0,Alberto Mata

,This guy was such a confusing class. Save yourself from the confusion and buy the book he goes by on amazon. its called The most dangerous business book youll ever read. Theres also a free download of it if you search for it. He comes off really intense but hes just an interesting guy messing with students. Getting the book will make the class easy,5.0,4.0,Phil Bartlett
,"Last class I needed to graduate. First time I took Dr. Massnick but she is what people say - helpful, caring and tries to make the class fun and interesting. This was an online research class so not a lot of fun. I heard the in person class studies cold cases. Wish I had taken that one with her.",4.0,4.0,Kimberlie Massnick
,"Prof. Evans has great lectures but is not clear at all in his expectations. For example, you'll complete your first assignment with no instructions as to what he expects in your answers and will probably get a low grade. There are only 4 homework assignments, midterm, final exam, and a ""subjective evaluation"" (participation and attendance combined)",3.0,4.0,Brent Evans
,"She is a good person, very interactive. But whats the point if your grade will suffer. She is very strict and uses her old exams, she doesn't give it back. She is more concerned about her looks (flips hair a thousand times and is always playing with her hair) than the knowledge. Reads from power point, doesn't add on to what she reads.",1.0,5.0,Leticia Perez
,"Ratana tries his best & I respect that, but he still falls way short of being an effective professor for 229. This was his first time teaching 229 so I can only hope this was a result of inexperience of teaching this course. His lectures are unclear, unorganized, & he made frequent mistakes. He also posted our full names next to our grades & IDs",1.0,3.0,Ratana Ngo
,One of the easiest classes I've taken. The lectures are boring but you will learn a lot from her class. She's pretty nice and will reply to your emails quickly. I missed a test once and she let me retake it. She also gives extra credit for going to events and writing reports about them. I recommend taking her if you want an easy class.,5.0,4.0,Qing Zeng
,"Awesome teacher!!! Connects the lecture and lab very well, which gives you the ability to understand the material better.",4.5,1.0,Manfred Cantow
,"Dr. Kim has a great personality with an accent to match. Neither of these assist in understanding the materials.

She recognizes students who try!",1.5,4.0,Jisook Kim
,I LOVE this man.,5.0,3.0,Patrick Brown
,"I took this professor for acg2001 and acg2011. Love her! she does make you work for your grade but only because accounting is not an easy subject.

Definitely take her!",4.0,4.0,Christine Errico
,"Had her back in Fall 2019, just rating how she was back then. You probably won't learn much from her lectures but this class is an easy A. Tests are easy and she legit had only 2 HW assignments. There is also 1 research paper but she's a easy grader for that. Tests are straight from the powerpoint and are scaled if everyone does poorly.",4.0,1.0,Athena Crowley
,You need an 87% average on the three tests to be able to skip the final; he boasts that he'll show you the final beforehand and you'll still fail.

,Best professor around! His philosophy 101 class was my favorite class. Cannot not recommend anyone else but him.,5.0,1.0,James Stockton
,"The nicest, honest professor this University has. This man will put in time outside of class to help his students.

Other profs should learn from how he teaches.",5.0,2.0,Mark Joyal

,"While content reviewed in class is posted on blackboard, his notes aren't understandable if you miss class. There's about 5 assigned books, they're horrible reads and if you just listen when he reviews them you don't need to read them. He doesn't help when asked for assistance. Lots of writing required - 3 wikis and 28 blogs. ",1.0,5.0,David Allen
,"This professor is just as hard as Mary Allen, another a&p professor at North Harris. She knows the materials and explains them well. I just don't like her aloofness. In class, she is funny with lectures; but outside of class, she is  totally opposite. So unapproachable.  She doesn't show much interest in answering questions.",3.0,4.0,Rebecca McClay
,"1301. His class is all LECTURE, keep up with your notes, stick to two essay questions that he goes over out of the five and write in notes in detail, the rest you can jot down little notes.

,"Mark is one of the best professors I have had! He is so passionate with teaching. His teaching style is dynamic and fun. The lectures always pass by fast.

,Very fair with hard tests.,4.0,4.0,Scott McAleer
,"Super Easy to pass. The powerpoints are online and she pulls all her exam questions from them.

,Some homework is confusing because of all the explanations but quickly replies to help you understand it. Cares about students and wants you to succeed in class and after.

His tests are so hard all of the tests were curved by 10-15 points each. At least he noticed how hard his exams are to help not fail anyone. The discussion posts every other week were super easy and a grade booster.,3.0,3.0,Mitchell Ratner
,I really wanted to enjoy this class. Phelps is very opinionated and constantly contradicts what's in the book and DVDs. He is overly critical of the ONE PAGE writing assignments and is known to berade the class before passing out the graded essays. Very disappointed,1.0,3.0,Ted Phelps
,"Organic chem will ALWAYS be hard, so i cant 100% blame her for my experience, but she only grades based off of tests and a couple quizzes. Exams are worth 90%. Its stressful and shes difficult to learn from because of the accent, i would highly recommend buying the textbook to support learning, it helped my grade a lot.",4.0,5.0,Jisook Kim
,She was the best english professor that I had. It was all papers. There was not a final exam. Papers are so much better than tests and that helped me a lot. She is always willing to help and she will let your correct papers until you earn the grade that you are happy with. I would recommend her for English 101 and 102.,5.0,2.0,Galina Sundberg
,Nicest prof at CU.  Can't believe he is leaving.,5.0,4.0,Alan Jagolinzer
,"The extra credit she provides is worthless and honestly doesn't add anything to your grade even if you are borderline, so its not worth doing. Final exam contained stuff professor did not say would be on exam. Midterm and assignments are easy. Professor makes class very interesting.",4.0,3.0,Ellen R.M. Druffel
,"Good guy, but terrible teacher. Class is start to finish lecture where he shows no energy for his subject, and merely talks in a monotone voice the whole class. I showed up every class and took notes. His online homework is absurd, takes at least 3 hours for each homework, and there is about 25 of them. Online quizzes are easy. Tests are hard!!!!!!",1.0,4.0,Steven Fritsche

I studied everything he said during class and never missed a class, yet still did bad on every quiz and they're worth 50% of your grade. Final is a 12 page research paper.",3.0,4.0,Phil Bartlett
,"I really enjoyed taking ADM 4143 with Dean! He gives really great examples, and his lectures are always so interesting.

He is an easy marker and is always willing to help and and answer your questions.",5.0,2.0,Dean Culligan
,"Zero direction.  I learned more from YouTube lectures regarding her assignments than I did from her. Having to show up to her class was a waste of my time and efforts.  I was not there to learn about her personal life, or to hear my classmates read paragraphs of short story handouts. We are ALL adults who know how to read! -Borning",1.0,4.0,Karen Depinto
,"She's a very good professor, extremely knowledgeable and respectful. However, the workload for this 100-level class is ridiculous. This class was harder than my organic chemistry. There are many requirements and the readings are long. Some of the reading assignments were barely discussed in class. She has a tough grading approach.",4.0,5.0,Victoria Wike
,"She gives a lot of readings, and she never talks about the readings in class. The things she teaches in class are different from the reading but she somehow expects you to be able to connect the two together whether or not you understand the readings or not. you can definitely see her if you dont understand the class but really dont take this class",2.5,5.0,Hillary Jeanne Haldane

,Amitava is a very great and nice professor. He explains things very well. The class is compromised of easy quizzes before each class (easy way to boost your grade). Do really good on the assignments. You have all week. He is a veryyyy easy grader. That said. The final is EXTREMELY difficult. Try your best to make a 95+ in everything else.,5.0,3.0,Amitava Dutta

,"Super easy class. Just do the work and cite things correctly, that's all you need to do. You only get 4 essays that have a 450 word minimum and 6 multiple choice quizzes. Everything is open book.

,"EXCELLENT. I always sucked at math, he made sense. Explains wonderfully, good pace, always stops what he's doing to answer your question RIGHT AWAY.

,"Could be considered a language class. Taken for Science credits. Prof is very serious, on the ball, but totally human and reasonable. GREAT prof!",5.0,4.0,Abdallah Mohamed
,Undoubtedly one of the best professors in the MAE department. Clearly cares deeply about his students learning and understanding not just general concepts but everything that he says. Puts aside extra class time just for reclarification of material and questions people have. No textbook but his notes are so well done they are better than a textbook,5.0,1.0,D. Joseph Mook
,"McConnell is a great philosophy professor. If you're looking for advice on how to write a better English paper, this isn't your guy. If you want to write better about philosophy, then sign up. He gives a lot of prompts based on great movies like Memento or Groundhog Day. Exploring the philosophy of my favorite movies in essays was a great time.",4.0,2.0,Jeffrey McConnell
,This class is way too much work during a pandemic and when all our courses are online. This woman acts that we only have her class to worry about!Her explanation for projects is horrible!

,"The critical thinking in psychology class is self explanatory.  While it is easy to pass without reading the book, you miss out on an amazing piece of work.  The class attempts to assist in critical analysis of claims, and the books have and interesting way of conveying that.  Pretty funny and a great professor",4.0,3.0,Peter McLaughlin
,"I don't know why the reviews are so bad here. Sure, the material is not ground-breaking--but what do you expect? She is a really good professor and knows her stuff. She is always willing to meet with students if they have questions and stops in class if you ever have a question. She even gives you study guides with the topics on the test.",5.0,3.0,Carolin Schellhorn
,Only took the online finance course; but my experience was a bad one. This is one of the poorest quality professors I have had a the university level. Outdated lectures/ practice problems will not help you prepare for the quizzes and tests. Quizzes and tests are given with a strict time limits and can be hard to complete. Lucky to get a C.,1.0,5.0,Raja Bouzouita

You've been warned,1.0,5.0,Craig Meixsell
,"Very knowledgable and had essays to back up claims. Brought everything back to a timeline to help w/ understanding. Notes are crucial for success on tests but he will outline everything and tell you what he expects. Most classes are lecture based. Was very considerate with COVID, concerned about our home life and that we had tech to use for class.",4.0,3.0,Alexander Tulin
,Taking 351 with Stewart was amazing. The class is lecture heavy but he's hilarious and easily accessible outside of class. He generally doesn't use powerpoint so the notes you take are your lifeline but he answers questions during and after class and through email. So glad I chose him for my advisor. He also knows a lot about chem and bio,5.0,4.0,Mark Stewart

Hate to break it to you, but there WILL be work and you WILL learn a thing or two doing it.",4.0,2.0,Beba Shamash
,"Prof Du is an excellent professor. He is one of few who actually asks for feedback from his students and changes accordingly. ACCTG 471 was an excellent experience. While you will have to work for your grade, A's are not out of reach with studying and an attitude to actually learn the material. Great class.",5.0,4.0,Kai Du

,"He was pretty funny, and everything was basically a guaranteed A, unless you actively tried to do poorly. I did have a really good GSI who was really helpful!

,"Started to realize towards the end of the semester that her explanations for otherwise simple concepts were quite convoluted and confusing.

She is absolutely incredible and I will do my best to take a class with her every semester.",5.0,4.0,Kim Shively

,"I found my class with her incredibly boring, nobody wanted to participate, and it was difficult to pay attention because of the low energy level of both professor and student. Some of the articles we read were interesting, but I was one of the few that actually did the assignments. Grades tough, you have to write extremely well, but borin",1.0,5.0,Sarah Kelen
,"He is probably the easiest professor! I had him twice a week. In the first 3 weeks, he cancelled class 4 times! Now, as the semester is ending, class has been canceled 7 times already.

,great prof,5.0,3.0,Michelle Rizzella
,"While extremely intelligent, she expects too much and rewards too few. Her class is completely discussion based, so its critical to read all 150+ pages of journals for each class. Papers are graded harshly with horrible feedback. She clearly cares less about student progression and more about an immediate correct answer. Save yourself the trouble!!",2.0,4.0,Miriam Lowi
,Took this class Aug-Oct 2016. He ended up being one of my two favorite professors (so far at least). The work was challenging but not absurdly difficult.

It was fine.",3.0,3.0,Anna Teekell

,"His lectures are pretty boring but there are only a few, after that it's a pretty chill class. Not many requirements for speeches, and will give you a fair grade or better. Ignores the book, has two food days and has a ""question of the day"" every class day (takes about 30 class mins ..). Recommend, if looking for an easy A.

But overall i enjoyed going to class.,2.5,4.0,Mi Sook Hur

He plays videos either to enforce his lesson or just for fun and to entertain. I recommend.",4.0,2.0,Hank Bordowitz
,"Professor Epley is a great person to take for 1310, especially if you're a beginner freshman.

,"I've gone to several office hours to ask more specific questions, and I found him to be rude and condescending. He will help you, but be prepared to feel like an idiot for asking.

,"Good luck with these tests. They are horrible and almost impossible to pass. The coding part is easy, but the multiple choice is hard. I definitely recommend you to NOT take this class.

,"Mr. Haze is a great instructor.  
 He expects you to do your work and your job.  Honestly, I did not do my work and got an incomplete, but I have to say I learned a lot. I think he should back off the report a bit. Lot of work to not get a grade but I cant say I did not know.  Great caring instructor.",3.5,5.0,Dennis Haze

,"I recommend anyone but him, he does not take the time to actually teach students. Very inactive when it comes to labs, by walking around class and expecting students to self-learn. The exams were really hard and he does offer extra credit but what does 1 point really do when he rarely likes a students response to the bonus question.",2.0,5.0,Larry Miller
,"one of the best teacher's I've ever had at Tech. She made me actually want to go to class, and her in class activities helped me remember a lot of the new vocab/verb conjugations. Highly recommend taking her if you can, you won't regret",5.0,2.0,Melissa Pilkington

,"Guy is a genius, potentially overqualified to teach a 1300 class. Not super engaging and overly complicates material. WATCH THE VIDEOS ON THE SYLLABUS. Makes material incredibly simple. Funky grading system too. If you're good with math you'll be fine. If not, it's not a huge deal, just need to work a little more. Not incredible but not terrible",4.0,3.0,Douglas Ehring

There's a quiz before every class to be well prepared for the lecture. In",5.0,4.0,Amitava Dutta
,"Dr. Britton is one of the absolute best teachers I've ever had. Her lectures were engaging and interesting, and a lot of that has to do with her excitement about the subject.

This class would be remotely interesting if it was not from this professor. He also sucks at answering emails and is not the most understanding",2.0,4.0,Robert Amey
,"One of the easiest engineering classes ive taken and will ever take. Exams were easy enough to just study a night before or 2 nights before class didn't even feel like it was on my schedule except for lab which was painful to attend because of how much time would be wasted.

You wont hate the project if you pick a subject you're actually curious about.",4.0,2.0,Patrick Brandt

Her exams are easy since she creates problems similar to homework and in-class examples.",5.0,3.0,Faith Bridges

,"I only had him for a 1-credit pass/fail class, and passed.  By the skin of my teeth.  The class was far more difficult than its credit weight and pass/fail status would imply; it was about abstract concepts in discrete math, and he knew his stuff, but was not very good at communicating it.",2.0,4.0,Pavel Dubovskiy
,"Extremely clear, well paced prof. His decent sense of humor also helps. You really can't ask for much more. On a subjective note, I found the actual course content itself to be terribly boring, but that's not his fault... just my bad luck for having to take a course in which I have no intrinsic interest.",4.5,3.0,Ravi Adve
,"Not a bad teacher. Her tests are difficult, and much harder than she explains the problems to be. Homework is easy, basically try until you get it right.

,"He is a nice guy, but he really sucks at teaching. On the study guide, he only gives us the names of artwork and thats all. He talks a lot, and introduces the topic in a really boring way.

,"Writing is not my favorite subject nor my strength.English 1101 is very time cosuming. Thus, it can be challenging. Make sure you have time to take this class.  Professor Glauber is fair at grading. Therefore, i would absolutely recommend him. I got a B, Praise God.",4.0,2.0,Philip Glauber
,"I absolutely loved this professor at the beginning of the semester. Very caring and understanding, but if you have a question, be prepared to wait a while for a response. If you need to ask a question, talk to him in class. Besides that, if you do the work you will get an A!",4.0,3.0,Dan Baker
,"Amazing, amazing professor. He truly cares about the wellbeing of his students and is extremely responsive to emails.

,"I took his hybrid class and did pretty well. When I didn't understand something, he was very helpful and took time to explain it better. You can do well in his class as long as you do all of the labs. There were many tests, but no other assignments. I would recommend him.",4.5,2.0,Micheal Gregor
,"Took LFS250 with him, and thought that was the worst he could do. Prepare for LFS350, cuz he would give you even more unorganized course websites, even more confusing wordings in online quizzes, and assignments that are totally waste of your time.",1.0,5.0,Will Valley
,"He's not great at lecturing. He has clicker questions, so attendance is mandatory. His tests are taken from the examples in the book, just with different numbers.

There's also homework on Pearson.",2.0,4.0,Martin Epstein

You can do so much better",1.0,5.0,Garrett Tyson

,"WONDERFUL woman! Her lectures are really slow (most people stopped attending them) but her teaching style allows for a lot of flexibility and you really get to write your papers/responses on whatever you want!

She's a terrific asset to have.",4.0,3.0,Stephanie Zitrick

,"I gave this professor a chance in the beginning, but she moves through her lectures incredibly fast and she doesn't care to make sure everyone is on the same page.

,"I took his PSY101 class online and it was it very frustrating. He was very unorganized and for it being an online class, it was pertinent to be well organized. He was consistently late getting his recorded lectures out to us and had to keep pushing back due dates that all piled up at the end of the quarter by his doing, not mine.",2.0,2.0,Joshua Buchanan

,"She is the worst. I cant belive that anyone has actually said that they have liked her on here. This class sucks. She makes you feel dumb. You have a new paper to do probably every week. Her assignments are never clear and shes confusing. Shes also a nut. Save yourself, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!",1.0,5.0,Beba Shamash
,"As said by others, Jim has his pluses and minuses. His lectures are soft spoken and rarely refer to the material we're covering in the section. However, he's a very nice man and genuinely seems to to want everyone to get an A in his class. No due dates for HW, attendance is optional and if you miss an exam you don't need a retake. Nice guy.",3.0,1.0,Jim Logan

,"His accent is very heavy, he does not clarify what he teaches in class so get ready to teach yourself!!! he shows absolutely no enthusiasm, but he'll give you chance to make up homework if you miss it. I was extremely bored in class, he would talk and write on the board and if no one understood he'd go on to  the next problem. AVOID HIM!",1.5,4.0,Frederic Mynard
,"if you get an option of a thursday or tuesday lab take thursday because the tuesday lab can tell you everything on the lab exams, don't take the quizzes lightly, they add up and are a huge factor. Don't rely on her as a teacher, she simply goes off the ch in her class time. She does her best to be there but in the end its just a job. good outlines",2.0,4.0,Stephanie Zitrick
,"Professor Brown is amazing!! The workload is heavy but his lectures are so informative & you can really tell he knows his stuff, so even though there's a lot, I respect it. He's been really forgiving about grading during COVID. He even made us an all-black artist playlist in honor of BLM. I'd recommend him to anyone. You'll learn a lot from him.",5.0,4.0,Kirby Brown
,"One of my fav profs at Fordham. SO smart. Wasn't looking forward to taking this cause I'm not religious but she taught the Old Testament as stories, not religion so it was very interesting. 8 one page papers throughout but super easy. Actually made me enjoy the Bible which I wasn't expecting. She always held my attention and is so kind and caring.",5.0,3.0,Mary Callaway
,"2 tests, many quizzes, 1 paper, no final. Terry is extremely scattered in his lectures but he's a nice, funny guy. If you're good at memorizing experiments and their significance to psychology and learning material independently outside of class, this is the class for you. It's hard to sit through lectures most days unless you participate",2.5,2.0,Terry Palmer
,"I literally slept through his class. He joked about people sleeping and actually said ""this class must be great because you come in, sleep, leave and get an A""...exactly what I did.",5.0,1.0,Bert Zarb

,"Rambles on lectures and jumps around topics. Most things we did or he talked about didn't tie into the topic we were on. Don't have to take notes, won't know what to note down. Even though i didn't really learn much, easy A just do the study guide and study it. Can make up tests. If you want to really learn A&P take someone else otherwise very easy",2.5,2.0,Gary Fultz
,"Mr. Pomerantz is awesome! Music Theory is complex, but he makes it easy to understand. Example worksheets are done in class together and he'll check with us to make sure we are understand the content. Homework is assigned nightly and sometimes projects. Pop quizzes over triads and seventh chords are done occasionally and only 3 tests the semester.",4.5,3.0,Mark Pomerantz
,"Creed is very smart, but don't take this class if you want to be an unbiased, thoughtful political scientist. As was mentioned, the readings are very heavy, but they are all aligned with his political beliefs, and he will berate anyone who does not agree... And he quite literally made up midterm grades (I have written 10 papers, 3 have been read).",2.0,4.0,John Creed
,"Professor Walling was a bit unorganized throughout the semester, we were jumping from chapter to chapter. However, I would defiantly take him again, exams and quizzes are straight forward, he drops lowest quiz grade and gives lots of extra credit. I would take him again.",4.0,3.0,Stanley Walling
,"Learning another language is very difficult for some people, but Svitlana combined multiple approaches to make it more accessible and for people to find what suited them best to learn.

,"Really nice professor. This class is going to be one of the most 'doable' classes you'll take here. She gives practice exams and lots of extra credit.

Youll be good",5.0,2.0,Nalini Venkatasubramanian
,"Yes, she does yell, but get use to it!   She's an excellent teacher and teaches at a university level for a city college.   Like any physical science class you have to put effort in to get the grade you want.   If you study 1-3 hours a day, you will get an A or a B depending on how well you absorb information.   Got an A by studying 1 hour a day.",5.0,3.0,Rosmarie Elizondo
,"I love this professor and I feel that class lectures flew by. Since he lets you use a finance calculator, it made the class a lot easier and honestly more practical.

,"Very strict on attendance, punctuality, participation, and reading ahead, but announced quizzes ahead of time and hinted at their questions and how to answer  unambiguously.

,Take Biology 1190 with Garyen and you will not regret it. Bio 1190 is generally course heavy but he makes it interesting. His Exams is based from the textbook covering the most important things in his lecture and in his powerpoint which likely ends up on exam. His Quiz is harder compared to his exams and their is is iclicker but they will help U!!,5.0,3.0,Garyen Chong

,"Mr. Wilson was cool. Only problem that I truly had was his lack of grading throughout the course. Since the class is based on writing, you don't really know what your grade is until the end of the semester. Fortunately, I received a B in the class, but was aiming for an A. If grades matter to you, do not take him. If not, go for it. Good luck!",2.0,3.0,Michael Wilson
,"I have had many professors, but this one definitely needs to take an accent reduction class. Other then that, she is nice, but lectures are boring,  basically, you don't have to be there, it is just like watching slides that you can find online, but attendance is mandatory. If you need a credit, take it. For knowledge, look somewhere else.",2.0,3.0,Chunwei Xian
,"She is an amazing professor! Would take again any day. Take very good notes and do the homework and use YouTube for help.

,"Dr. Callaway is a passionate, Knowledgable, and caring professor. Her lectures are incredibly interesting, and her class isn't too hard, but she grades papers and micro-themes toughly. She does however allow revisions on the papers, and gives really good feedback on it. She will make you want to continue classes in theology, even as a finance major",5.0,4.0,Mary Callaway
,"This class wasn't too hard, only graded by homework and tests. There are no quizzes so you have to do well on the fairly difficult exams. It gets easier over time, I don't think the Professor made a difference, he really enjoys what he does and gives a huge curve at the end so if you take the exams and do the homework you'll be fine. Taken online.",3.0,3.0,James Cooney
,"AVOID THIS TEACHER! She creates her own tests and the answers are often wrong even when counted right by the textbook! When I asked her a simple question, she had to use Google to find the answer!

,"If you have any interest in studying Political Science, stay away from this professor as she does not teach it. Lois' teaching style is to espouse her own views and belittle yours.

,There are a lot of lab reports due and very little guidance as to how to do them and what he expects. A lot of the material is based off of his lectures not really a lot of pictures to help really understand the concept of what is going on in that part of the body system. No HW except for lab reports but you have to read read read to understand.,3.0,5.0,Nathan Staples
,He is very passionate about astronomy. Tests aren't hard if you attend lectures and review sessions because they're based directly off the study guides and he tells you exactly what he's looking for. He's very kind and approachable but can go off on tangents and lectures can be a bit boring.,3.0,1.0,Charles Nelson
,"Tests are easy and she doesn't expect too much from you. If you go to the lectures, its possible to get an A without reading the textbook. She's a great professor and cares a ton about the information. The info is a lot, but its valuable. There is a discussion that is mandatory, but it helps so much! ",4.0,4.0,Hannah Britton
,"Such a sweet man. No homework only 3 exams, but he hands you them weeks ahead of time so you know exactly what's on them. You dont have to show up to class to pass especially if you have the textbook tho lectures, as boring as they are, do help a bit. A 10 page paper but it's super easy, just watch 3-4 movies and summarize/review them.",5.0,1.0,Donald Nelson
,I took his Intro to Music class and it was the worst teacher I've ever had. Without fail each one of his quizzes would have one or more mistakes. He also refused to put grades in Moodle which made it difficult to know my grade. He is also hard to reach out to. He still has not forwarded the email he sent to everyone but me in my class.,1.0,3.0,Hank Bordowitz
,Raquel is the most misleading professor i have ever had. She does not accept excused absences if you've missed class more than 3 times. there is a quiz almost every week and they are ridiculously hard. if you do not openly support her personal beliefs than you will not receive participation points even if you show up to class. DO NOT recommend,1.0,4.0,Raquel Polanco

,"Fantastic, enthusiastic professor with high standards. Makes you want to do well in class.",5.0,4.0,Elizabeth Fowler
,"Often gets off track with her lectures. Has course info in multiple different places that are not always aligned/updated.

He is an easy grader on the tests, but some of the questions are a bit ridiculous; you have to be in class 100% of the time to learn some of the tid bits which seem so insignificant at the time, but later he'll test you on. He's also very monotonous!",4.0,2.0,Richard Sammons

,"Going into this class I was excited to learn about philosophy but coming out of it, I don't think I will ever take another philosophy class again and if I do it will definitely not be with Jeff.

,P. Marsh is very clear in communicating the information in his lectures. In a 200 level science class the lecture and information presented is challenging so efforts important.

,Our semester completely fell apart due to COVID. How do you reach a professor who never responds and is never on campus? Dr. Wigginton does not respond to emails or voicemails. Her expectations are unclear and she enjoys taking points off for reasons not provided in advance. Just plain rude.,1.0,3.0,Melissa Wigginton
,"Loved this Professor! He was very accessible and interesting. Always sent out reminders. The tests were EXTREMELY hard, but he always gave a review of the tests before hand and basically everything was on the test. But he does make you work for the answers! I did enjoy his class and came away with a lot of information that was relevant to life.",4.0,4.0,Marc Zamkotowicz
,"She's not the best teacher in the credential program, by far. She treats us like we are in her 7th grade class, and she spends more time acting weird than teaching. I'm the type of student who gets 95-100% on every assignment, and she marked me down for the most random reasons. I don't think that's far when she's so vague on what she's looking for.",2.0,3.0,Allison Arnold
,"Professor Dyer was always kind, creative and engaging. Lectures always included an anecdote which related to the course material. Never hesitated to listen & help with a problem, but you gotta show up to the office hours & send emails. Firm but fair grader. If you're a first year student, Dyer is the way to go for Math 1000.",5.0,4.0,Dan Dyer
,Mager is one of the best teachers I've had at KCC. He takes time to go over the lectures and he uses good examples for almost everything that are very easy to understand. He's funny too and you can tell that he has a passion for the subject. Tests are tough-so it's a good idea to be at every class. He's extremely helpful during lab. ,4.5,3.0,Kenneth Mager
,"I LOVE Kathleen. She is an amazing effects animator who is still very active in the field. Type in her name in IMDB if you're curious. She has a tendency to talk quite a bit, but her lectures and advice is really helpful in the long run. Her figure drawing class is also INCREDIBLE. My favorite class at CSUCI so far.",4.5,2.0,Kathleen Quaife
,"Very good professor, very good designer! Learned a bunch!!",5.0,1.0,Shara Haghjoo-Moghadam
,Kata is an amazing professor with a lot of knowledge and wisdom to share.  She is good at engaging the students and is very willing to be a learner and not just a teacher.  She has a great teaching style that is fun and easier to learn from.  She is friendly and seems to genuinely care about her students. ,4.5,2.0,Katarzyna Beilin
,"Go to class, do the labs and practice the problem sets. Lectures based on the textbook but I've opened it less than 5 times and I'm not struggling. If you don't want to ask her questions, ask the lab instructor and you'll be fine.",4.0,2.0,Sara Geizhals
,Great Experience. The teacher was very helpful.,5.0,1.0,Gail Gelburd
,"I took her for bench step aerobics and she was great!  Very encouraging and she is great at teaching the class.  She is lenient about missing class, but don't abuse that luxury because she will lower your grade by letter if you miss too many classes or show up late too many times.  She's awesome! No book or any extra purchases for this class.",5.0,1.0,Lapetria Rhoe
,I never read the textbook it was a waste of money. Just make sure to show up when he goes over the study guide it is very very similar to the exams. He cares about anthropology but mostly just him talking all of class. can be hard to understand with accent. Never once put scores on elearning.,3.0,1.0,Lee Jian
,"His accent is hard to understand but besides that he's a great and funny teacher. The lectures move very fast but only because he has so little time to teach all the material. When given a chance to take it slow, he's great at explaining. Homeworks are difficult and you will need to spend time studying before/after class, but it's well worth it.",4.0,4.0,Pavel Dubovskiy
,"One of my favorite profs at UO. Puts a lot of work into his courses and he will make you do the same. He deals with native issues from a native perspective and chooses amazing, intersectional texts (comics, poetry, plays, novels, stories, videos, etc) . Sometimes there's a lot of work but it never felt burdensome because it was always interesting.",5.0,3.0,Kirby Brown
,"Class attendance is mandatory. It is lecture format, and she provides great context and analysis necessary for understanding. Maybe it was the room but the atmosphere was great and intellectually stimulating, she has a cool pocket watch, turn your wifi off and you feel like time went back 100 years. Hard marker, but I recommend this course ",3.0,4.0,Inna Viriasova
,Very rude teacher. Never gives a direct answer when you ask a question.  The work isn't hard but I don't like being treated like a 16/17 year old.  It's a lot of work but not hard. She gets really mad when you don't attend class. Not worth the stress for me.,2.0,4.0,Trudy Couch
,"Hella awesome. Brings lecture to a more practical context. Laptops are allowed. If you read, youll be more than fine. She is warm and understanding. She definitely knows what she is talking about and is passionate about it too. If you read and understand the basic gist, easy A. If you dont, ask her and shell take time to explain it till you get it.",5.0,2.0,Barbara Lusk
,"Very helpful. His lectures are long and kind of boring, but he is aware of this and lightens the mood with humor. He knows a lot and is always willing to help. When I took harder levels of theory at a 4 yr, I emailed him questions about my homework and he helped me with it. He wants his students to succeed.",3.5,3.0,Karl Warner
,"I loved this class. Velleman is excellent professor, perhaps the best I've had so far at Cornell. I had no experience with Statistics before his class, but his lectures and textbook were so clear. You can tell that he knows his concepts inside out and he's great at explaining them. I strongly recommend him.",4.5,3.0,Paul Velleman
,"Dr. Guerra is AMAZING! Very organized, detailed, and inspirational educator. He motivates you to be the best performer version of you. Super detailed feedback that will empower you to overcome your mistakes and do brilliant for the rest of the semester. You must take him if you want to learn in a professional production environment. He is funny too",5.0,3.0,Oscar Guerra Nunez
,She thinks her students are idiots and thus acts idiotic.,2.0,1.0,Lesley Louden
,"I have really struggled with math all my life. His course is very good to where I can easily understand what is going on before I leave class. He give homework and quizzes BUT not something that will take you 5 hours to do, he gives just enough to where I understand the material and I am not overwhelmed with work.  Uses study guides for tests.",4.0,3.0,Jason Pode
,"if you have to take a bio class, MAKE SURE you take Vanderzalm. shes an extremely clear explainer, and is very understanding when you are struggling. she is a very caring professor that actually wants all her students to do well. love her!",5.0,3.0,Pamela Vanderzalm
,Mr. Tyson carries an extremely boring classroom. His prezies are not helpful at all. You need to be ready to put in effort outside of class by reading the textbook and interpreting it. Tests are tough and the questions are weirdly worded. Probably the hardest course I have taken at Missouri State.,2.5,5.0,Garrett Tyson
,"Honestly, Mr. Corder is a good teacher. As long as you do your part as a student and read the chapters, you should be fine. There's not a ton of homework and if you miss something, he's really understanding about it and will probably re-open it for you.",4.0,3.0,Leon Corder
,"The people on here who actually liked Prof Peters must have sucked up because that's the only way she'll like you. Her grading is lame. When she does leave comments on papers, they are completely illegible. She ruined my interest in English. Better participate or she'll fail you. Reading is a must. Least favorite teacher at SBCC or any school. ",2.5,1.0,Meryl Peters
,Monica is an amazing teacher is willing to go the extra mile to help her students! I highly recommend taking any bio you can with her! If you have questions she will always willingly answer them and explain it multiple times until you totally understand it! 10/10!!!!!!!!!!,4.5,4.0,Monica Hall
,Extremely passionate about the subject matter. Turned what could be a very boring class into an interesting narrative each class. Thoughtfully executed discussions led to a comprehensible understanding of the subject matter. The discussion response are easy. The main paper is not hard if you do not procrastinate. The midterm and final are easy too.,5.0,3.0,Anna Amundson
,this class is really easy you don't have to read any of the novels he gives you as long as your take notes in class. however his lectures are so boring you might fall asleep but overall the class is easy and the mid terms and finals are take home,2.5,2.0,Thomas Albritton
,"Took her for civic engagement. Great class, and I'm a business major. Not too hard, but you have to listen well in class and take good notes; no need to read the book! Civic engagement is a lot of fun, you get to volunteer at a hospital or other med institution.",4.0,3.0,Victoria Wike
,This is one of the best professors I've ever had. He always gives interesting lectures and is willing to help any student. You can easily go to him during office hours and work out any issue or question you have,4.5,3.0,Frank McLaughlin
,He is a great teacher. You will get an A as long as you do all the assignments he assigns and his assignments are really easy as well.,4.5,1.0,William Boyer
,"She was a really hard grader which was extremely frustrating. You have to write 8 one-paged ""microthemes"" for the class and it was almost impossible to get higher than an 8/10. She was super nice and cared about the class and knew her stuff, but also made the midterm and final really long and hard. Overall I liked her, but you have to work hard",4.0,4.0,Mary Callaway
,Good class. Organized and easy to follow. Test are open book / open note. This doesnt mean they are easy but if you take your time the answers are pretty easy to figure out. Essays can be challenging.,5.0,4.0,Kevin Stagg
,"Great guy, but he makes us take the quizzes before he actually teaches the material, so they are tough. 7 online quizzes 2 tests and a final. You have to read case studies and be prepared to talk about them because he will call on you and that is what participation points are based on. He starts with a joke everyday. Its hard but I recommend him!",4.0,3.0,Ryan Hunt
,Theres daily readings for about 1/4 of the given book. Lectures were given by student instead of her. You may even be able to plagiarize as she lets it slide. Nothing is posted online so dont expect to keep track of it. Never went off the syllabus.,1.0,1.0,Nicole Pekarske
,Prof. Regan is not clear. hard to understand. Poor at teaching. Got nothing from this class. Oh well.,2.0,4.0,James Regan
,"Kello is a nice guy, but he is clearly way more focused on his research than on his teaching. He barely prepares his lectures and his assignments are thrown together last minute and are extremely vague, almost unintelligible. The class was obviously an afterthought for him, and he is not experienced enough to wing it.",1.5,3.0,Chris Kello
,"Among the worst professors I've ever had. She projects blame onto students for her own lack of knowledge, ridiculously vague and contradictory requirements, and even her inability to use basic teaching technology like Carmen or MS Word. When you point out her contradictory requirements or mistakes she makes, she comes down hard on you. Rude. Awful.",1.0,5.0,Jacquelyn Meshelemiah
,He's awesome.  Tough class but great teacher,5.0,4.0,John Shon
,"There are in class assessment questions so you have to attend zoom lectures but Dr. reddy has amazing powerpoint that are really good for studying for exams.

One exam was unnecessarily hard but other than that, she is a solid prof.",4.0,3.0,Radhika Reddy

,"This professor is awesome. There is really no reason not to do well on your essays. He gives you a chance to let him look them over and also have another student in class look them over. Unless you are just blowing off those chances, there is no way to really fail any of his papers. Try to pick a topic that he's excited about for your final essay.",5.0,3.0,Dylan Parkhurst
,"She was unclear on everything that she would assign. It was confusing, the lectures were long, she accuses you of cheating with no facts to back it up, and she will not reply to your e-mail's. I would not recommend this ""teacher"" to anyone. She is rude and inconsiderate to her students. The worst experience in a semester.",1.5,5.0,Sandy Bolt
,"Dr. Smith is a great professor. You can tell he really cares about his students and wants to see them succeed. When I had questions, even if they weren't related to class, he went out of his way to help me. Also, his lectures were interesting and he gave useful feedback on assignments. I would recommend taking his classes.",5.0,4.0,David Smith
,Sure she knows her stuff on political analysis but she is a horrible professor. Pop quizzes on the days most kids are absent(like the day b4 thanksgiving) and 7 memos total in the class. She couldn't care less about her students and literally makes sure they do bad. The class is extremely boring and she makes sure we go overtime every class.,1.5,5.0,Tana Johnson
,"I loved this class.  While some topics are boring, others got the class going.  Great teacher and I will recommend anyone taking his PHI class.  All in all, my favorite class yet.  He cares about your opinion.  If you back it up with decent evidence in why you chose to go that way you will get a good grade. Also, do the presentation.  Its will help.",5.0,2.0,Leonard Winogora
,The best!,5.0,1.0,Stephen Cuono
,"Mr. Kanetis was my favorite teacher I've taken at Moraine. As long as you study and participate in class you should be fine. If you're the type to skip class however, I would look for a different professor if you're looking to get an A. Quizzes every Monday and participation points on the days there's not to lose. Made class fun and was awesome!",5.0,3.0,Peter Kanetis

,This guy is the best! If you're looking for an easy philosophy class this is it. It doesn't get much better than this.

,"Dr. Krueger is very easy going, likes participation and discussions.  She likes group activities and grades fairly.  4 assessments, 4 learning activities (mostly in class), 1 group application presentation as a final.  Didn't really use the book.  Lectures from PPT and tests from those slides and your notes on her lectures.",4.0,2.0,Dianna Krueger
,"Dr Anderson is one of the smartest professors at VSU, he gets to know all of his students and goes out his way to make sure you pass. After taking this class you begin to feel like a scientist. but, He uses stack grading on a point scale. always attend lectures, its impossible to learn the information on your own. Study ASAP before exams. go to lab",5.0,5.0,Corey Anderson
,We used the course reader every week to focus on sentence structures and you go over them in class. The sentence structures that you learned that week must be in the essay that is due. I believe we had like 5 essays for the semester and they were all six pages long. He gives you a week or so to do them and people peer review them before you turn in,4.0,3.0,Richard Sammons
,"shes so nice, loves to talk, and is awesome! she isnt very clear on assignments sometimes though.  but shes ALWAYs there to be helpfull. i didnt go to class that much, all you had to do was show up for 15 minutes, and take a quiz, but if you missed class that week, you could make it up the next class. you have to write 4 papers.. thats all !!",3.5,1.0,Galina Sundberg
,I took him for Soc 001 online and it was an easy A. Just do the reading. You can rent the book on Amazon for less than $20. No group projects or homework. He assigns you chapters to read then you take an exam based on those chapters. Questions are straight forward and some of the questions you can Google and get the answer easily.,4.0,2.0,Jose Lopez
,"Great class, was very enthusiastic about topic she taught which was Harlem Renaissance. Only two tests which was open notes etc.. One writing project with presentation. Very interesting class. Would go off on tangents semi related to then we were discuss in class on days then get back on topic but it was a great class learned a lot.",4.0,2.0,Ebony Gibson
,"No, this professor is not funny, he's cringey. Quiz topics are to vague to predict for any of his classes, and will not provide you with any review whatsoever. You just have to flatter him to get a decent grade. Don't believe the positive reviews they're very misleading and understate his very apparent flaws as a professor, probably the him tbh...",1.0,4.0,Patrick Rosenkjar

,"his lectures are funny, interesting, and sometimes very moving.  i was not looking forward to this class and i loved it.  considering his quizzes are simple translations and papers get proofread by other students AS WELL AS the prof. and TA you have to be an idiot to do badly.",4.5,4.0,Larry Scanlon
,"She has favorites, and most of the time they are girls, and it well be extremely clear when you're the only person to have your hand up and get completely ignored. Not sure how you can get on her ""badside"", but if are you're going to notice the difference in grading.",3.5,4.0,Laura Paglis

,"Ryan is awesome! took him for Portfolio 1 & 2. He is helpful in class, but because of short class times,  take advantage of his office hours. He is always willing to listen and help you work through your creative issues to create something truly great.  He is a tough grader -  he expects a lot of out of his students to prepare them for ad life.",4.0,4.0,Ryan Romero
,"The content she teaches is interesting, but she has ideas about intersectionality and all the problems with that way of thinking (if you know what I mean). Go into her class with skepticism and do not allow yourself to be swayed. People are individuals, not their cultural identity. Just because she is a professor doesn't mean she absolute.",2.0,3.0,Summer Harlow
,Way too much work and reading for a 200 level class. He expects his students to do way more work than should be expected for a class at this level. He is very opinionated & seems to make personal vendettas against students who voice opposing thoughts.

,"He was great with in-class discussions of texts and it really helped unpack a work. Being in class was a good time, we led the discussions. My problem was he was very vague with paper requirements and feedback, so it was hard to improve your next paper.

,Diane is extremely nice but I would not recommend her if you're looking for a professor who will help you out.

AVOID.",1.0,1.0,Sam Gilmore
,"Professor Haney is a great teacher.  He challenges the students to think, uses cold calling effectively, and is crystal clear in his lectures.  His syllabus doesn't overwhelm you with reading.

Classes can feel like they go on for a bit, class times are a bit lecture heavy, but he makes it interesting.",5.0,3.0,Kyle Hetrick
,"Professor Razon was great and provided a very simple class which was appreciated due to the pandemic. His assignments and quizzes are straight forward.

,"He is a good teacher and instructor. Engaging , very enjoyable to listen to. The only  reservation that I have is that there is some indications in his teaching about his political views that he subtly includes in his class.

,She flows with how fast the class comprehends rather than working with an individual. She's very personable though so if you have the time to commit it's a wise decision. If you're pressed for time and don't have experience with German you might be in rough shape.,4.0,4.0,Jenneke Oosterhoff

She expects you to self teach.,1.0,5.0,Wanda Jones

He gives plenty of chances for extra credit.",4.5,4.0,Larry Miller

,"With Dr. Douglas, it's all in the readings (lectures are weak). Seasoned econ students will do very well and learn lots from the fantastic reading materials; new ones will be hand-held in learning how to do econ (papers, for example).

Mustari is a great math teacher.",5.0,3.0,Charles Mustari

,"Like others have mentioned, the material itself is easy, but she made it really hard by giving a ridiculous amount of homework, with mandatory attendence of lectures, tutorials, and weekly quizzes.

,"Took her for stats (hybrid) and trig (online). Both were super easy. For stats, tests and quizzes were open notes. For trig, you could take the quizzes twice and keep the higher score.

After exam 1 and 3 HW I was discouraged to work hard",2.0,5.0,Jon Pearce
,Dr. McLaughlin is a nice guy but the critical thinking class is useless in my opinion. He assigns 8 homework assignments that are worth next to nothing point wise. He expects you to participate in class daily & deducts points if you dont. The midterm was decent but the final was ridiculously stupid and worth 35 points of your grade. Never had a C!,3.0,5.0,Peter McLaughlin

Very funny and laid back guy, highly recommended.",5.0,1.0,Jim Stewart

She is very passionate and I loved her!,5.0,3.0,Shonta Smith

,"Took this course online. I missed the test twice because of misreading the syllabus both times she reopened it for me. Four test, post a discussion once a week and one project.  I would highly recommend taking this class online.  Easy A and good exercises and information in Medical Terminology.  Couldnt have been happier with this class!",5.0,1.0,Linda Grenache
,"The textbook used is terrible and doesn't have an answer key online, the homework isn't properly graded so you can't track your progress, her accent makes it hard to understand lectures, and she assumes we know everything so resorts to writing ""duh"" on the board instead of explaining concepts. For a potential math major, she is a wrong choice.",2.0,5.0,Heekyoung Hahn
,"Perhaps it helped that this class was all review for me but it was my easiest class all year. HW is easy, she tells you what to study for explicitly, highly recommended if you're just completing your Spanish general requirement.",4.5,1.0,Nelly Rios-Freund
,"You can tell she's been teaching the same for a long time. All of the assignments are time consuming and repetitive. I've had to map out a full 8 semester schedule, three different times in the first semester. All te assignments are just busy work which is annoying because there is so much of it. This class is just a huge waste of time, avoid it.",1.0,4.0,Shonta Smith
,"its hard to find anything nice to say. she is an awful professor. can't use moodle or collaborate. wastes an extreme amount of time in class, teaching nothing herself. very outdated ideas. very unclear, poorly worded instructions. is very rude if you have any criticism of the way she poorly runs her class.",1.0,4.0,Sandra Orser
,"great humanities credits. she's a little scatter-brained, but always good for a laugh. the topic is really interesting, and she loves what she's teaching. you never use the book and tests are outlined on review sheets that you get during discussion. if you study and give even a little effort, you should do well.",4.0,2.0,Monica MacAulay

,Opposed to all the other comments I LOVED Mrs. Kurtz! I am not a math person and always struggled with math in high school but Mrs. Kurtz taught me in a way I understood and I never had below a 98 in her class the whole semester. As long as you pay attention in class and DO YOUR HOMEWORK the class is not hard at all. I wish i could have her again.,5.0,4.0,Christianne Kurtz

,"Professor Peters is brand new but she is great.  She is honest and tells you exactly what she wants on assignments.  She is also understanding and will extend a deadline if people are struggling.  Very fun class because she has a great sense of humor.  Not too difficult of a grader but is crazy for APA, she can see a 1.5 inch margin a mile away.",3.0,3.0,Callandra Peters

,"Took his online PS1 course, was really solid. We had roughly 2 max, one hour long lectures a week, 4 quizzes over semester (v easy if you watched), response paper (just summarize), and three exams.

,"Pretty easy class! 3 assignments and 2 tests and by the end of it you have yourself a working website! The assignments have video tutorials so all you gotta do is follow them and you'll be fine. For the tests, I just used quizlet and also merged all the powerpoints together and just control f searched everything and made A's on both exams :)",5.0,4.0,Youmei Liu
,"I didn't expect to see anything negative about Ms. Banks. In my class, we would have fun. She treats everyone with respect. It is a shock  to read other people's  experience and hear that it was a terrible one. Personally,she is very positive and supportive. She's gives constant encoouragements to her students. She is known to help student in need.",5.0,1.0,Sharon Banks
,"Very caring, and nice. Instead of a heavy lecture she brings guest speakers. One 1 test that's only 5 questions.",5.0,2.0,Claire Crane
,He is by far the test professeur i've had. She is extremely smart and can answer any questions on chemistry. He also breaks down the material to make it easier to understand. He always makes time to meet up with his students and is very patient with questions. He really wants his students to do well.,5.0,4.0,Neil Schore

,"The majority of the class focuses on the group project, but in addition there are lessons in between on other things. His class is a good intro into engineering. He does seem unapproachable but deep down he is a funny nice guy and if you do your work he'll give you an A.",4.0,3.0,Shawn Yetman

,I was not a big fan of this bio class. I felt like there was way too much information to read and hard to grasp so many small details when studying. Prepare for tons of textbook and powerpoint reading to study. The best part though is that you can study helpful practice exams and Quizlets.,3.0,4.0,Deni Galileo
,"Your success in this class is up to your TA. Mine was great and made everything very clear. Gilmore is intelligent and gives somewhat engaging lectures, but his examples are all very abstract and to understand the notes and handouts it'll take a few tries. TA does all of the grading too, and he held midterm prep sessions. So the TA is important!!!!",3.0,2.0,Sam Gilmore
,"Dr. Creed is the BEST. Hands down the most passionate professor I've ever had. I looked forward to going to class every day. He never talks at you, always with you; every class is a super interesting discussion.

,she is really nice and keeps you motivated.,4.0,2.0,Kellie Claverie
,"Nice guy, but this is not a blow off class. An A is definitely possible, but you must watch all of the films and study the sociopolitical aspects of each film mentioned in the lectures. You will have to watch most of the films on your own time outside of class, and almost every film is in a foreign language. 3 essays make up most of your grade.",3.0,3.0,Duy Nguyen
,Just keep your homework on track and your Gucci,4.0,3.0,MaryGeorge Whitney
,"Straight forward online class. Highly recommend taking during the summer. Two case studies, two midterms, one final. Tests are less than 20 questions, OPEN NOTES. You do not need to turn in any of your homework or practice questions. I do not recommend wasting money on the textbook, I stopped reading it after the first five chapters.",5.0,1.0,Wendy Shan
,"Luigi's teaching skills are perfect. Glad to have him for my MATH. In class, he solved all of my questions even if I couldn't express it properly or the problems were not really related to the lecture (that's the best of him, very approachable). Outside of class, you will see who is the BUSIEST MAN on earth.",5.0,2.0,Luigi Sorbara
,"PLEASE, when you see her name -SKIP IT. She will fail you even if you try hard. She will call you out on things and will make you feel uncomfortable in front of the class. She is a horrible proffesor, she does not know how to teach to treat her student. DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND DON'T TAKE HER",1.0,5.0,Susie Boydston-White
,"If you don't care to learn, don't pick this teacher because he will help you learn. Great teacher. A lot of work, quizzes and essays. All the work will make you smarter, but it can be too much.",5.0,4.0,Jerry Blanton
,"Dr. Kindonakis is a great professor. I recommend taking him. He's not an easy professor, he covers a lot of material, sets the bar high (for KSU at least), and naturally requires you to work hard . He's a smart guy and no doubt a good particle physicist. Take him if you want a challenge and to get a lot out of the course.",5.0,3.0,Nikolas Kidonakis
,"Linda is an excellent teacher.  She really makes the class interesting and has a great personality.  I learned far more in her lab than in the a and p 2 lecture. Tests are easy: multiple choice, matching, fill in the blank-not tricky.  Tests also include identifying body parts on dissected animals so make sure you pay attention when you do it.",5.0,2.0,Linda Menard
,"Shes the easiest English professor Ive ever taken. Do your work to the best of your ability and there should be no reason why you do not pass the class. This was supposed to be a class meeting in person but because of the pandemic, learning for this class was transitioned online. Shes very responsive by email. Take this professor!",5.0,2.0,Andrea Abrams
,she was one of my first professors at CC and I loved her teaching style. Very clear on material and how she grades. Super picky on grading. knows a lot about chemistry and passionate about it. Lots of practice problems and studying required to understand material for exams/quizzes since it is a more difficult class but manageable.,4.0,4.0,Karen Goodwin

,"Mr. Daigle advised female students in our class to invite other (complete stranger) students home with them for study group. A lot of his other advice was also archaic, not to mention dangerous. He is stuck in another time. He also gives very few tests on lots of material, so if you have a bad memory, this is a class to skip. ",1.0,5.0,Paul Daigle
,"The professor cares for her students and tries her best to explain the materials. It would help you to read the chapter ahead before going to class or the lab so that you understand what she's talking about, because it's a lot of material to process. She grades on a curve and tutoring is extremely helpful Omar is the best tutor so far for Chem.",4.0,3.0,Sharon Borglin
,"Great class. Fewer bonus marks available than in CS 145. Midterm and final are both still pretty hard, but grading is forgiving.",5.0,4.0,Prabhakar Ragde

,She is great. she will help u if u need it but u shouldn't need it if u do the HW and pay attention in class. she covers everything u need to know and no more. she will not make ur life miserable. It is an easy A if u do the Homeworks. Homeworks are on the quizzes and the quizzes are on the tests. Take her class if u can! You will not regret it!,5.0,1.0,Phylis Palma
,Really easy class! There are 3 main assignments and a midterm and final. The website is really easy and she gives step by step video instructions for each assignment. If you're confused shes very easy to reach out to and she WILL help you. This was my easiest class all semester.,5.0,4.0,Youmei Liu
,"Not really a cinema class, more of a study on social cultures and politics' effect on movies made worldwide. Some movies were genuinely a bore to watch but some were great films I wouldn't have seen otherwise. I made it through the essays, group presentation, and quizzes with only seeing 3/16 movies. The lectures were very boring as well.",2.0,3.0,Duy Nguyen
,"She did a video presentation at the beginning of each week, but did not really explain anything just read off the instructions that we can do, not really going into depth. Also, didn't really answer the questions on the discussion boards, I learned the answers to things from other students in the class. It was not clear what her expectations were.",2.0,4.0,Claire Brisson-Banks
,She's just amazing!,5.0,2.0,Cerrie Rogers

,"She really great, and she is very helpful.",5.0,4.0,Diana Flahaven
,"She's super nice and SMAD 150 is insanely easy. She goes over all of the information on the tests in depth beforehand, so you can pull a B without even studying. Overall my only issue with her is that she graded everyone's group presentations really hard, but she's a solid teacher.",4.0,3.0,Nan Zheng

,"To keep it simple... I received an average of a 74 with Prof Conner for Intermediate Algebra. The next semester in College Algebra I got a 95.

,"I did every homework, spent so much time on this class, followed her rules and never got an A. I don't recommend her",1.0,5.0,Carolyn Holcroft
,She is really nice BUT she gives alot of reading. You need to read for her!!Tests are detailed and she assigns two textbooks so 3 to 4 chapters to read per week.

,Workload is absurd. Was seemingly shocked that COVID19 affected students' abilities to complete assignments. Waited until April 12 to make course adjustments. Expects students to prioritize her class above all else but hasn't graded papers from week 3. Remember that English teacher in high school you couldn't stand? She's back and better than ever,1.0,4.0,Rachael Smith
,"Professor Swartz is one of the best professors you will ever have. Don't get me wrong, his grading is very frustrating, but you will learn and become a better student because of him.

,"Very easy class. We had a total of 4 papers (two easy subject papers, one research paper and a book review). Also, he grades very fair and he is lenient. He shows a lot of movies. He has you make a binder of all the classwork done, and checks it towards the end of the semester but barely looks at it. I am now going to take him for ENC1102.",4.0,1.0,Philip Glauber
,"Highly recommend him. Took Cal 2 and 3 with him. Gave extra points in exams and still at the end. Always answers emails. Met with me at his office for extra help. Clear explanations. I would take him again, no question. Learned a lot from him. Best math teacher from all I had at HCC.",4.0,3.0,Jaime Hernandez
,Hands down one of the best teachers I've had. Took A&P one semester with another teacher who failed me by 4 points. I went into his class thinking the same thing was going to happen and it 100% did not. He makes jokes the whole time and it truly makes learning fun. I took his hybrid class and felt like I learned so much from him.,5.0,4.0,Jeff Clasen
,"This was such a great class. Ms. Khan always shows up early, is available if you need help, and makes sure you have clear guidelines for each assignment. She makes English 120 fun and as painless as possible! Only downside is there's a lot of homework, but she's not a tough grader.",4.0,2.0,Lakin Khan
,"Prof. Gartland is a very sweet lady & she cares about her students. One important thing to note is that you will want to attend the live meetings because she throws bits of important exam info out in the meetings. Her off topic tangents are useful- sometimes exam questions are based on them. Overall very easy. Shes a little unorganized, thats all.",3.0,2.0,Beverly Gartland
,"Great Professor! If you like philosophy you should definitely take one of his advanced courses. Brilliant guy and lots of in class discussion.

,"This professor was great! Do not take Spanish with anyone else! She believes that this is a class that should not drop your GPA.

Highly recommend!",5.0,1.0,Nelly Rios-Freund
,"She was an awesome teacher. She uses tophat to take attendance, to ask questions in class, and for homework.

In Closing attend class, do homework, read.",5.0,3.0,Kate Liszka

,Professor Hines means well but doesn't come across clear. Took her class for Diversity in the Workplace.  She talks in circles and is confusing.  If the readings say one thing she says another. Be prepared to take notes and fast. She does not post slides and she only leaves them up for a moment in class. She makes each student repeat what they read,2.0,3.0,Debbie Hines
,"I had Professor Steffens for the Women in Journalism FIG. She was helpful and I felt like I could easily contact her outside of class for help with my resume, internships, etc. She had a lot of insightful tips for having a successful career in journalism.",4.0,1.0,Marty Steffens

,loved this class! you have to go to class for the power points because he doesn't use blackboard. you don't need to buy the book. my book is brand new and I have never even opened it. he cares about your questions and goes into detail with everything just so understand it. he is very funny! theres no hw just two essays midterm and final. take him!,5.0,2.0,Rasheed Alexander

,"He runs a very to the point class although he tends to go off on tangents quite a lot and can spend half a class session on a story. Otherwise good class, though every time John Wild comes out with a new version of the text with a new appendix he feels compelled to change his text. Makes for expensive textbooks...",3.0,1.0,Paul Skelly

,"Loves to teach 5 minutes before the bell and 5 minutes after. I admire the fact that he wants to show nearly every proof in the book, but it takes away time from actually showing a little application. Tests are hard, but curved. Very ambiguous about the grade you are getting until the very end. Occasionally assigns an absurd amount of homework.",3.0,4.0,Charles Rezk

,"Currently in my last quarter at  UCI, I can firmly say that Gilmore was one of the worst sociology lecturers I ever had. Often cuts off students and even the TA. Wants things done his way and his way only. A total dinosaur who does not listen to students but instead patronizes them throughout the lecture. A nightmare for the 3 hr. majors seminar.",1.0,3.0,Sam Gilmore
,"If you are serious about your future, and you wish to learn to be a professional in life, Meryl Peters is a great professor that models the examples of what it means to do work.

,"Randy is the bomb as a sculpture teacher, inspires you to do your best. Is a very relaxed teacher that gives a few tests but not a ton. Randy gives you freedom to create your version of the projects and appreciates effort. Not everyone in the class is an ""artist"" or has the skill but he makes u feel u do.",5.0,2.0,Randal Jones
,He is a very hard teacher. His notes are a very dumbed down version of his tests.  The tests are all 2 or 3 questions.  I never used the textbook because he gave us all his notes and we were allowed to use them on tests.  Do not think that the notes will help and make sure you study to pass. HUGE curves on tests and quizzes.,4.0,4.0,Engin Egeseli

,"To be fair, Partovi is very knowledgable and many people really do like him. However, you should expect 100 pages of reading a week, an amount of rudeness, and a final that will consist of writing a 12-15 page historiographical review of the scholarship relating to the topic being taught. Keep in mind that this is a lower-division undergrad class.",2.0,5.0,Pedram Partovi

,I took him for both national & state/local govt. He's hilarious and invests in students. Definitely take his class if you can.

Great conversation.,5.0,3.0,Jack Goodyear
,"The class is only as tough as you make it.  Try not to procrastinate if you can help it.  She tries to make it so you add to the final paper throughout the semester.

,This man is a horrible professor. I have never in my 20 years of living encountered a man so distasteful and rude to their students for absolutely no reason. Then you get to class and you're lucky if he let you know what was going on ahead of time because he can be so useless to be such a nasty man. Very strict attendance policy so be wise,1.0,4.0,Mike McLane

If you have a chance to take a class with him, take it.",4.5,3.0,Dhavan Shah

My 72% got curved to A-",4.0,4.0,Serge Jasmin

,"You will not pass the tests if you skip class or don't have a friend that takes good notes to borrow from.

Please Goodwin do something about this,1.0,1.0,Karen Contorno

It feels very insensitive when she wants grace.",2.0,2.0,Anna Teekell
,"I got an A in her class. Her lecture is pretty clear. She explains every step on the board.

,"HARD CLASS. You have to go to class to get an A. His tests are hard and his final is essay, MC plus old material.

TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",5.0,3.0,Stephen Hinshaw
,"He's not a bad professor but I find his test difficult. I feel as if he should give worksheets for us to study and at least give a study guide for the final exam, not just review in class with us. This class will be difficult for students who isn't majoring in the scientific field or care too much for science.",2.0,4.0,Kenneth Mager
,"Had orgo 2 with her in the summer, it went by really fast so you had to keep studying every day. It's a hard class but she tries to make it easy, gives lots of practice and the exams are what you expect.

She is very approachable and makes time for her students, which I admire. I learned so much in her classes and recommend her to everyone",5.0,3.0,Simona Montanari
,Your whole grade is based off two take-home exams. He is very narrowminded and imposes his views on you a lot for a philosophy professor. If you ask a question he *kind of* answers it before twisting into one of his favorite topics and moving on. I thought this class would be cool but wish I didn't take it now.,3.0,1.0,Michael Meyer

He seriously knows his stuff and has a contagious passion for music that's highly contagious and makes the class fun and easy (if you're paying attention).

,"I liked this class. Dr. Ayers has a dry and sarcastic sense of humor which I enjoyed. He does a good job of explaining the material and will answer questions until everyone understands it. Tests are not hard but you need to study your notes and, to a lesser degree, the book.",5.0,3.0,Douglas Ayers

,"Mr. Hughes is an amazing instructor! He's very lenient with how well you perform in this class, but does expect you to show up to class.

Would take again!",5.0,3.0,Laura Mandell
,"Fall 2006 was his first semester here, and I think he did a good job.  He's passionate about the subject.

,"Bio 101 is like taking Bio 435, expects you to know all of the information. Tests are 50 multiple choice questions and 50 points for short answer.

",2.5,5.0,Mark Bremer
,Absolutely one of the best professors I've ever had. Hosts open labs in which she will sit down and review anything you may have had trouble with during lecture or lab.

,Class was out of 1000 points. She gives a lot of extra credit points on exams and quiz's to help boost your grade. She is very nice and willing to help.

,"Prof. Mangone is very passionate, and honestly he goes a little overboard on the material. It is useful information, but most of it won't even show up on the exam, which can make it hard to know what to study. However, his exams were fairly easy comparatively. He is a great choice, and his material emphasizes memorization more than concepts.",4.0,4.0,Marco Mangone
,"TAKE. Sets you up for success! As long as you attend class, you do not need the textbook or look at the powerpoints he posts because he goes over the material that WILL be on the exam.

,Professor Zheng is so sweet and her class wasn't too difficult. For some if the projects she shows you during class so you have most of it done by then.

He is really good at explaining things if students are confused, really caring guy",5.0,3.0,Kenyon Evans-Nguyen

,"Mr. Lee is a great professor. I honestly do not know why he has such a low evaluation in here. I took Accounting and Business Computer Applications with him and the classes were pretty easy.

,As a biology major I was required to take Dr. Laycock for general physics 1 and 2. His lectures are okay - you must attend because he does daily clicker questions.

He belittles students for asking questions that he deems unnecessary,2.0,3.0,Silas Laycock

,Shes a solid choice when it comes to a professor but beware she docs points for every little thing.

,"Professor Yue is awesome! She pays attention to all her students and takes the time to understand us not only as students, but as individuals.

,Excellent industry experience and reference. Industry expert guest lectures. No mid-term. Bi-weekly quizzes instead.,5.0,4.0,Terry Stevens
,This she has a thick accent that is very hard to understand. The way the book teaches the material is how she teaches it. The equation / algebraic expressions are literally on one slide. So there is barely room to understand what is going on. The fact that she only grades quizzes and test will make it harder to pass this class. Do not recommend.,1.0,5.0,Natalia Shkiler
,The professor is a great person and response to emails in a timely manor. The lectures are interesting and class participation is a must and part of your grade.

,"Ms. Howson's style of teaching can be a little blunt and takes some getting used to. Once you do, though, it becomes very easy to get into the material.

A great teacher overall.",4.0,3.0,Cynthia Howson
,"3 exams, and a map quiz. Theres an app you have to purchase about $25 where you do you're homework and where she takes attendance on she also does mini quizzes during lecture so don't miss class.

He grades the majority of all work.",3.5,3.0,Malin Pereira

,"While she uses the book a lot for homework, she hardly ever uses it to teach. Her entire method was hinged on whether or not you took French in high school.

,"This teacher is not to bad. He has industrial experience and uses these for examples for the material out of the book.

Overall, a good instructor.",3.0,3.0,Marvin McEntie
,"First day of class, prepare yourself for a rude awakening. He starts by telling the 100+ students that he's in the Illuminati.

Passed the CLEP exam at the community college next day.",1.0,5.0,Phil Bartlett
,He's a really great professor and as long as you attend all the classed the tests aren't very difficult.  He GIVES you the essays to prepare and they're worded exactly the same on the tests.

He also gives a lot of leeway in papers and projects.",4.5,2.0,Pete Sigal
,"Her teaching style isnt very helpful at all. All she does is show examples of other artists and past student drawings, and sets up things for you to draw and tells you to draw what you see. She doesnt go in depth with explanations and ive never seen her draw anything. This class is for someone who is already somewhat decent at drawing",1.0,2.0,Yvonne Klocek
,"JP Tang is a bit of a death-by-PowerPoint professor.

Teach yourself.",1.0,4.0,George Vlachos
,"She was a very energetic, helpful, and fair teacher.  Some students on here complain about too many surprise quizzes, but they weren't surprises.

,"Great professor, great lectures, and relaxed atmosphere. take notes, you do not need the book if you have a classmate that lets you look at theirs when you need to.

,"As a professor, she is one of the best I have ever had. Not only does she truly care for the students and what they are able to take away from her class, but she does see the effort that the students put into her class. She tries to help clean up students' pronunciation whenever possible, so that the students speak as authentic Chinese as they can.",5.0,4.0,Jianling Yue
,"I LOVED Raquel!!!! She is definitely my favorite professor at LSU! She is so smart and knowledgable about a lot!! Her quizzes were pretty hard. There are two exams, a midterm and final, but she believes in group exams so you get to take them with someone. I failed almost every quiz but ended up with an A. Speeches are not bad at all!!",5.0,2.0,Raquel Polanco
,Great stories and pretty entertaining. Class is fairly easy and you don't have a book so everything is straight from notes and lectures. He loves talking about study abroad programs and has been to what seems like every country. When he talks about a region he usually has pictures of himself in these locations so it keeps you interested for sure.,4.5,3.0,Wade Watkins
,"Doesn't pull any punches. He is honest in his review of speeches. He airs some of his opinions, and though I disagree, he made me laugh. I've become a MUCH better speaker thanks to this class. Easy at the beginning, gets progressively harder. Gave a take home test the first day of class, to turn in at the end. Doesn't talk about the book in class.",5.0,1.0,Michael Bassow
,"If you want to be successful in her class, you get to do good on homework and tests. She does give a lot of homework, but compare to my old professor that I already dropped is nothing. You get to do good on homework because she'll take point off if you get the wrong answers. Extra credits on test review sheet. I 100% will take her class again.",5.0,3.0,Andrea Wang
,"Prof. Lang made our 8 pm Earth Science class interesting. He tells a lot of jokes to keep the class woke, alert, and entertained. This ""boring"" class was actually great. He's a great professor. He does everything to help his students earn an A in his class. If you didn't get at least an A- you didn't utilize all the opportunities he made available.",5.0,2.0,Garry Lang
,Don is an absolute beauty. Goes over lots of practice problems in class which is very helpful for the exams.,5.0,3.0,Donald Haidey
,Easy A. Enough said.,5.0,1.0,Linda Berg-Cross
,"I took him for sociology 1301 and 1306. His class is extremely easy. I took one for summer and the only complaint is his syllabus layout. He organized his due dates by a day to day basis and not weekly which made things confusing. He's a little picky about grammar in papers, but not too bad. This was also an online course.",5.0,2.0,William Lockhart
,"You have to submit a thoughtful response on 3 pieces of literature each week. That was a lot of work. She posts a video lecture each week (usually a few days early) - watch them and take notes. Read the Essay Writing for Students text to help write essays. The essays were short, but you have to earn your mark. She always responds to emails promptly",4.5,4.0,Melanie Schnell
,Participation is the key to your success in this class.,5.0,3.0,Holly Deeley
,"Dr. Keeling is by far my favorite professor at CNU. I was really nervous to to take this class, as it was based around LOTR and I had never read it, but she made it very enjoyable. She is very sweet and cares about her students, and makes an effort to make class easy on them (extra credit on every quiz!). I highly recommend her!",5.0,3.0,Kara Keeling

,LOVED him!  Class was interesting and he is a GREAT teacher!,5.0,3.0,Douglas Ayers
,"She is honestly one of the sweetest people and is always willing to help. This course can get a little heavy at times, but she really helps to make it do-able and will always help you if you need feedback on papers. Awesome lady and I would highly recommend a class with her if you're interested in English and literature",4.5,3.0,Jocelyn McCarthy
,Dr. Albertson is a great professor. Her class is not an Easy A but you have a really good chance to get it. I would recommend taking her classes to anyone.,5.0,3.0,Julie Albertson
,"Worst professor I have ever had, do not take her course. She added no value to the course and I was required to teach myself the material. Some constructive feedback for her, spending the entire class going through problems without any lectures over the necessary concepts is not helpful and only causes confusion. Please add lectures to your courses",1.0,3.0,Misako Van Der Poel
,"She is the best Accounting teacher ever! I took her for accounting 1 & 2. I received A's in both courses. If you do the study plan she will give you up to 10 point to your total grade (up to 5 points each half of the class). Attend class she explains thing well, practice exams Are the same as the mid term and final just different number. #easyA",5.0,1.0,Christine Errico

,Pretty good prof.,4.0,4.0,Lee Maril
,"Dr. Osborne is a great teacher. The class has A LOT of reading, but other than that it is mainly just open discussion. It's honestly like a book club with an occasional test. He gives a few extra credit opportunities, but the rest of your grade depends on only three tests and one paper. Very interesting viewpoints on a lot of issues and a cool guy.",4.0,3.0,Jeffrey Osborne
,"She is a great teacher, her class is very interesting and there is a lot of customization to what you want. Asks and cares what you have to say. Lots of group work which is nice and she is very understanding",4.5,2.0,Meeghan Ziolkowski

,"Nice guy, makes every discussion really fun and interesting.",5.0,2.0,Arnold Smith
,"The GOOD: 
 - He uses a points system for grading, and gives you points for attendance.
 - Some of his quizzes are group quizzes, which are easier to pass.
 - Gives out a lot of extra credit work
 The BAD:
 - very unorganized
 - A lot of essay assignments
 - Made our class purchase access to an online program called MyCompLab which we used ONLY ONC",1.5,3.0,Jerry Blanton

,"Dr. Goodyear was definitely a challenging professor. If you differ from his view he will try to belittle you in front of the class. When his beliefs do not align with scripture he does not engage in meaningful conversation but instead shuts you down. In addition, two tests dictate 50% of your overall grade and 11 essays decide the other 50%.",1.0,4.0,Jack Goodyear
,"Disagree with 162015. My experience was he gave daily feedback in class discussions. He often would answer questions there so everyone would hear the answer not just the person who asked the question. You don't really need to do the reading but participating in the discussion is a must. If you skipped that, you'd be lost. There are no tests. ",5.0,1.0,Jason Green
,"Such a nice guy. Doesn't pressure you or get under your skin about anything, just reminds you a couple times about things only for the best. Straight-forward with instructions and always willing to help.",5.0,1.0,Bruce Prunty
,"Dr. Walling is a genius! I, honestly, do not know how CCP has been so lucky to keep him all these years. His knowledge on the world, through archeology and anthropology is astonishing! Every class I would go in like a sponge, ready to absorb everything he says! The man his so much to tell! Remarkable professor!",5.0,4.0,Stanley Walling
,He gives way too much work for a introductory English course at a COMMUNITY COLLEGE. Don't take this professor unless you want unnecessary work that won't ever benefit you in your career and overall life.,3.5,5.0,Jerry Blanton
,"I had Herring for Math 15 and she was pretty good. She assigned a lot of hw, which really helped with lectures and doing workbook problems. She lectures a lot, but always made sure to make it fun. Practice tests are very similar to the real tests. Nice professor.",4.0,3.0,Susan Herring
,"I had dawn for GH 125 and thought she was amazing, a lot of our class loved her. It's not hard at all if you show up and do the work. Im amazed with everyone posting how horrible she is. Yes she allowed for a lot of stories from others which drove me nuts but she is very straightforward. Again-PUT THE EFFORT IN and you'll do fine!",5.0,2.0,Dawn Zuidgeest-Craft
,"Dr. Ayers is one of the best professors UAB has.  Great sense of humor, and has loads of practical experience.  He's likes fast cars, and anything BBQ or beer.  Oh and he's really great at breaking down how marketing works.  Fantastic class!",5.0,2.0,Douglas Ayers

,"LOVED Prof. Juarez. He makes his grading criteria and assignment instructions clear. His lectures are great. You don't meet up, lectures are uploaded for you to watch at your convenience, but he quizzes you on the lectures for attendance credit. 2 Essays on topics of your choice pertaining to the material in class. Finals are easy. Replies quickly.",5.0,4.0,Jose Juarez
,"Dr. Fein is a knowledgeable professor who really wants his students to learn. However, he has very high expectations, and he can be too demanding sometimes.",3.5,4.0,Gene Fein
,"I would stay away from her by all means. She is intelligent but is a terrible professor. Be ready to read between 100-200 pages each week with her. She has made her political views well known. While she has asked subjective questions she is not open to opposing views, she will tell you what to think.",1.0,4.0,Hillary Jeanne Haldane
,"Very good Calc 1 teacher.  You truly have to earn the A, but you learn so much in the process.  If you are a hardworking student, take this class because she is very rewarding to someone like yourself.   I would definitely take her again. ",5.0,2.0,Minhua Liu
,"I would definitely take other classes with her and strongly recommend this class/subject! She is very helpful, understanding, and challenges you!",5.0,2.0,Katherine Mahosky
,"he's hard-core knowledgeable but forgiving grade-wise; and no class attendance policy, which is nice",4.0,2.0,Thomas Albritton
,He is a good person but doesn't teach well. He never clearly explains things and our book was horrible. I've had to teach myself everything and go into tests having no clue what will be on them. He randomly jumps between books and nothing really came together.,4.5,4.0,Wesley Venus
,"I would recommend taking somebody else if possible.  She has a split personality.  One day she will be cool and other days she goes into full-blown psycho mode.  I am not kidding.    She doesn't allow students to use laptops or cellphones to take notes or look up stuff to help out.  If you take her, good luck.  You are entering a nightmare.",2.0,5.0,Ana Norton De Evans

,Great class that gave me a better sense of self and provided more clarity in my life on what is important. What I have learned in this class I will use for the rest of my life.,4.5,4.0,Paul Coutinho
,"This class was easy for me as I had prior experience in the engineering field going into this program. A couple of group projects and some pretty hard homework and tests. If you are weak in math or engineering is not for you, don't expect to pass. I put in about 10 hours per week. Creativity and precision is key in this course.",4.5,4.0,Julie Albertson
,"I am confident in my belief that those who wrote negative reviews for Mrs. Liu did not apply themselves or pay attention in her class and then blamed her for their bad grades. Calculus is tough sometimes, but Mrs. Liu only tests you on the concepts that you should be an expert on, as long as you go to class.",4.0,2.0,Minhua Liu
,"As others have said, Justin is excellent at delivering complex material, like Hegel. The format of the class is always student-based, so it's essential to do the readings and come in with questions to make the most of it all. Meeting with him outside of class is always very helpful as well. VERY understanding and helpful. VERY.",4.5,2.0,Justin Holt
,"She depended a lot on power points, which at times made the lecture feel like it dragged on--fortunately even she admitted to this and attempted to stray away from them from time to time. Overall if you find the material interesting, there's no reason not to take her.",4.0,1.0,Kim Fitzgerald
,"McConkey is a great man, with a fun sense of humor.  He's extremely helpful and willing to work with you.  His tests weren't too bad, even if you never open the book.  The exams are multiple choice and essay questions are optional.",4.5,2.0,Dale Edwin McConkey
,"Pre Calc is the second most dropped class on campus. Here's why, You do not get any of your tests back so you can't learn from your mistakes, you don't get taught concepts, you only go over a few hw problems in class that have very little to do with the hw. Mrs. Ryburn is a very nice lady but the way the class is taught is not well results> fail",3.0,4.0,Victoria Ryburn

YOU MUST COMMIT LOTS OF HOURS !!",5.0,4.0,Alice Stevens

,"Professor Lamkin is a tough teacher.  Pros: She gives a lot of extra credit, she goes over some questions for midterm, answers all questions Cons: She teaches as if she is just reviewing which makes it hard to learn, test do not really correlate with her notes. Overall, she makes it easy to pass with a C, as you only need 700 out of 1220 points.",3.5,4.0,Diane Lamkin
,"Professor Elliot is really great to have in class. She sets very clear expectations. If you do the work, it's likely that you'll do well.",5.0,3.0,Dorice Elliott

,"Mrs. Johnson did voice her opinion, but she has said from the beginning you dont have to agree with her and was always opened to hear other students views.

,"I wouldn't recommend her online EDU104 class to anyone. She doesn't respond to emails  in a timely manner, and when she replies it sounds like she thinks you're stupid. It also seems like she thinks this class is the only class you're taking and you have no other responsibilities. ",1.0,5.0,Laura Hutton
,"I did not like his teaching style. He reads directly from slides, which he posts after class. His quizzes and tests are all multiple choice, and he offers extra credit. However, many of his questions are poorly worded and some confusing.",2.5,2.0,Tim Schilling
,"Try not to take this class if possible. Her lectures are so irrelevant and she often isn't prepared. She canceled class 3x in 3 weeks & we were expected to learn everything on our own. I honestly don't know why I showed up to class. If you are a self teacher and don't want to show up to class, this might be for you. She's very nice but can't teach.",2.0,4.0,Keikilani Williams

,"Ken is the man. All his classes are the same, there's no HW just 4 or 5 papers to do throughout the semester. He's an easy grader, just meet the criteria and have some minor knowledge behind what you're writing and you'll be good. Wish he taught more REC classes!",5.0,2.0,Kenneth Hanley

,"Honestly, the fact that he taught w/ Shinkle made him look better. But make no mistake, his modules were extremely difficult. The fact that he doesn't post his slides makes it hard to take notes. I got the sense that he & Shinkle were kinda just making it up as they went along. Generally it's an awful experience, but at least he has jokes I guess?",3.0,4.0,Jonathan King
,"Prof Seymour is absolutely hilarious. Participation is key in this class & he creates an atmosphere which allows students to engage with each other about what we've learned. His lectures however, are not always clear & do not provide enough info to prepare for exams, googled info not allowed. He's wonderful, but his professionalism needs work.",3.0,1.0,David Seymour

If you have this class in your cart delete it before it is too late",1.0,5.0,Jordan Ochs
,"I had to drop this class. I don't know Spanish, so it was even harder. The tests were impossible (completely in Spanish, even the instructions). Even people who do know Spanish failed his tests. He doesn't give any extra credit, even if you beg. *DO NOT TAKE*",2.0,3.0,Ramiro Rodriguez
,"Took him Spring 2020 (pre/during Covid). Very hard to rate him as he was a great lecturer but would go off the rails about things like going to the bathroom during class, or one time where he got mad at a student for trying to leave for a family emergency during class. Seemed very understanding during the transition.",3.0,4.0,Jaime Hernandez
,"I had to take this specific class twice, and I think if I had her the first time I would have finished on time.

She gave the class her math cell phone number to answer any questions we might have outside of class",4.0,3.0,Debbie Seipp
,"Worst class I have ever taken. I wrote a paper that followed ALL the guidelines, but it was failed because my ""views"" were different than what he wanted.

Save yourself the time.",1.0,4.0,Jorgen Hansen
,"I've found a technique to deal with prof like these: JUST REMEMBER YOU ARE AT A STATE COLLEGE. Enough said? You get what you pay for, even if cheap college isn't necessarily cheap. It's clear when a prof doesn't know the material they are teaching, but what isn't clear is why they expect you to know it. Input is Output so TEACH YOURSELF in upperdiv",1.5,4.0,Ratana Ngo

,I took this class over a summer and the information was presented very clearly.

,"Correa is a great guy. Extremely helpful especially if you ask for it. Although his test are very difficult with no partial credit, however he is willing to give you a lot of hints and explanation throughout the test. Lots of material to cover without enough time to do so means crammed chapters and lessons. Great teacher, hard class.",4.5,4.0,Leonardo Correa
,"I have nothing but positive things to say about Professor Hohing. He is one of the few professors that actually care about his students and will help you in anyway to pass and succeed in his class.

,"The most caring and approachable prof I've had. She can be biased at times and less knowledgeable about certain topics but the way she teaches her classes is very hands-on and enjoyable.

,"It's true that she is a tough grader, but tough in a good way. She is clear about what she expects and gives you the tools to do well.

He does not teach this as an Introduction to Finance.,1.0,5.0,Frederick Sarver

Overall, she is a wonderful teacher.",5.0,2.0,Melissa Pilkington

,"Great professor. I enjoyed his sense of humor, which I know isnt for everyone. His assignments arent hard, just get working on them as soon as you can bc they can be long. He repeats info often throughout the course to help you remember stuff & makes light jokes out of mistakes. Overall an awesome professor & great class.",4.0,4.0,Daniel Chase
,"I took speech with her over 10 years ago. I'm back to warn those of you who are nervous about speaking in front of others. I suggest you find another professor.

The book is expensive and confusing but she is great. Tests are easy!",3.5,3.0,Paula Hegner
,"Quite brilliant, but doesn't seem to prepare lecture beforehand (leads to some moments where he's staring at the board coming up with an example problem). Homework is sometimes off-topic.

He knows math but not one to teach it!",1.0,5.0,Shannon Vaughn
,"Mrs. Wang explains her lecture material very clear. There is homework for every chapter as in every math class. However, her grading is tough. Your grade are your test scores, nothing else.

,"I took culture, nature, and society with Prof Li and it was pretty easy. Took notes every day and when tests came around he'd hand out a study guide.

He's very respectful and enjoys when you participate.",4.0,2.0,Lee Jian
,"Tells interesting stories to make the class more engaging. She has a lot of experience in special education and loves what she does. Extremely knowledgeable about content. You do need a textbook.

It can be extremely hard if you don't get it, though.",5.0,2.0,Douglas Ehring

,"Professor Chooljian's course is not easy. You will have to study 2-3 hours a day in order to fully understand the main concepts and processes.

,She's a great teacher! She uses power points for her lectures to supplement the chapters you read in the book (there is some overlap but mostly varies).

By far the most challenging and rewarding class.",5.0,5.0,Charles Rezk

If you don't already know chemistry and are taking this class to actually learn it, good luck.",2.5,3.0,April Marchetti
,This class shouldn't be rated as a 1000 level course. I've taken upper level classes that were way easier. That being said he is a great teacher.

,"Worst professor ever. Very boring and unorganized lectures. Adam has zero passion and doesn't seem like he wants to be there.

Avoid this professor",1.0,5.0,Adam Meyer

,I would avoid taking Eric for MTH162. He gets off topic and then speeds through the lecture because he doesn't manage time very well. He assigns an excess amount of homework that you'll have a quiz on and expects it all to be done by the next class. It'll be pretty much a self-taught class. Good luck.,1.0,5.0,Eric Wiesenauer

Many of the questions are trick questions.",4.0,4.0,Jacquelyn Meshelemiah

He really cares for students and their learning. Definitely takes a little getting used to (aka you might not like him at the start, but that will pass)",5.0,4.0,Cheng-Kok Koh
,He was a pretty interesting. Very intelligent but looks disheveled all the time. Easy class as long as you take notes on what he says. Exams were easy and based off what he says in class pay attention and you wont have any problems. He is also repetitive so you If you missed something he is likely to tell you again next class.,4.0,3.0,Lee Maril
,Nothing about her classes are designed to help students succeed. Her online courses are rough if you're also working full time. I would rather do just about anything than take another of her classes.,1.0,5.0,Melissa Kenzig
,"Teaches by saying ""Look at your notes."" No help when questions are asked. If you have a good grasp on the subject before the class, he is fine. Not too much homework. If you do not know calculus 2, do not take him.",1.5,4.0,Scott Larson

,"Unexpectedly, I had a great time in Phil1. I am neither interested in Philosophy, nor a good writer. Still, I enjoyed professor's McConnel's class. He is an easy grader and always willing to help. The class discussions were always interesting. However, you might find yourself spacing out. He is disorganized, so don't take his class if you hate that",3.5,2.0,Jeffrey McConnell
,"Fun class, she is an excellent teacher and really encourages students to particpate and learn about french culture. It is not overly difficult, but you must study outside of class to retain the material. She truly cares about student progress. Wouldn't be difficult without previous French, but any experience prior to the class is helpful.",5.0,2.0,Lisa Loberg
,"She seemed cheerful and exciting the first day, then quickly became more arrogant. Especially if you didn't know exactly how she wanted problems worked, which she didn't explain at all. I'm a straight A student majoring in math, and i got a C in her course because she refused to help and only got smart when i asked her something. Avoid at all costs",1.0,4.0,Christianne Kurtz
,"Steve is my all-time favorite instructor. I went on to Uni after this and he's twice as good as any other teacher I've had. I wish so much that he would teach my Uni classes. He assigns a good amount of homework, but not too much. Just enough to make you learn. His lectures make sense. He truly cares about teaching.",5.0,3.0,Stephen Selph

Gives no reference material to help study for the final.,1.5,4.0,Feng Yang

,"She is great!! There is alot of reading in this class, but if you go to class you will get at least a B or an A on the test with out ever reading the book. She offers alot of extra credit pts. It was a great class, lots of fun, and very intresting. Pretty easy class!",5.0,2.0,Malin Pereira
,"He's ok. He cares about people participating to an annoying extent. If he learns your name, he's going to call on you a lot. There are a lot of iclicker quizzes. He teaches the class well, but the homework can be frustratingly and disproportionately more difficult than the examples provided in class. They're worth a large chunk of your grade.",3.0,3.0,Juan Wachs
,"Took him for intro to communications. Nice helpful guy. You write 4 out of the 6 papers he assigns and two of them we had were on Top Gun and Rocky. and you do have quizzes and a group project, but honestly not that hard.

Would not allow you to improve your paper's grade to show progress, instead on the next paper have you improve that criteria, but knock you down with another new one.  Endlessly talks in lecture and is ultra redundant, seems to love his own voice.  Class was *so* boring it made everyone seem dreary.",3.0,4.0,Kyle Hetrick
,"This teacher doesn't require textbooks for this class, with that said expect to have art supplies, and spend some money. The projects aren't hard but just time consuming, in one project you can easily spend up to 24 out of class hours on one project. Teaches useful principles to art design regardless of degree field. A great class to take.",4.5,5.0,Yvonne Klocek
,"Teacher was kinda annoying. Lectures felt really rehearsed (and not in a good way) and he seemed really into himself. Took this class in high school but didn't take the AP exam so I already knew most of this so if you're not an absolute beginner, don't take this class. There are extra credit opportunities (3) and tests were easy (3). No final.",3.5,2.0,Kerwin Swint
,"Entire class is based on a group project - unfortunately, I had the worst group. Projects are okay, there was one term paper and a few other assignments (not anything crazy) but like I said entire class is based on your one group project. If you get a good group, you'll be good to go. Marking criteria is not clear / no real schedule to the class",2.0,5.0,Will Valley

,Who has two thumbs and makes chemistry more difficult than it needs to be?? Dr. Evans. He is soo tough he barely ever talks and uses hand gestures to get his point across. Usually he just grunts and picks up things because he is unusually strong. He kept getting stronger during classes and began to smash things. I think he was also turning green.,1.0,1.0,Kenyon Evans-Nguyen
,"One of my top 3 teachers. I had her for Fairy Tales and Fables and I wish I was allowed to take that class again. The class was a very open discussion about concepts and it was a class that we could think in. Only had 3 essays throughout the class, and we had plenty of time to think them out. She's so sweet, and very easy going. Loved this class",5.0,1.0,Michele Randall
,"She has odd rules, like you can't ask questions after class about the lecture, instead come in for office hours. Her voice always sounded condescending to me, like she was teaching elementary school instead of college. At the same time, her explanations are partially mumbled and said as if she assumes we already learned the material. Would avoid.",2.0,3.0,Kathleen Rankin
,"Candida is an absolutely amazing teacher.  You get one point a day for saying something.  It doesn't have to be much.  She respects you and understands you are busy.

,"Hysterical professor. Tests are super difficult, and there is no study guide. But he gives EC clicker questions. And he divides 3 exams by 300 points (100 each).

Awesome professor who is genuinely interested!!",5.0,1.0,Richard Strange

I recommend going to her youtube channel BEFORE choosing her class to see if you can handle taking her class. Maybe this was just a bad semester?,2.0,3.0,Christine Errico
,"Oftentimes she will have a group assignment she will post on Canvas in the middle of a lecture. If you're at home sleeping or don't have a group, you will lose a lot of points in the class. She also requires you to attend three events outside of class - do not fake these, she will catch you.",4.0,2.0,Kelli Britten
,Prof Mantell is super sweet. Lecture is VERY boring. She does read from the PowerPoints posted in canvas so if you miss class a lot & review them and take notes you should have a good understanding. 4 exams & online quizzes she drops the lowest test grade.,5.0,3.0,Ann Mantell

Avoid this professor at all costs.",1.0,3.0,Susan Mulligan-Heckler
,"His lectures are funny, but no need to attend. Graded on 4 main projects. Group projects graded more leniently, but the two projects done alone are really harsh. Tries to be Cool Guy, occasionally succeeds.

,"I had to take two classes with this teacher. The first semester all he gave us were two reading assignments with papers, providing little to help your grade if done poorly on them.

,"Really good professor. It's kind of an interesting class and she posts handouts on the website before lectures, which makes note-taking a lot easier.

Shoutout Dr. Cash.",5.0,3.0,Mason Cash
,"Ok wow I can't stand how she talks, so boring, and her online quizzes are pointless. Also, her whole participation grade is CRAP because its only if you show up or not.

,"Great professor. During lectures, he taught with such clarity that I scarcely needed to look at the book. However, he's a bit difficult to engage with outside of the lectures.

She's just horrible, I recommend that you take someone else.",1.0,1.0,Saralina Kamholtz-Roberts

He emphasizes what's important (what you should know for tests) and when he gives extra information that isn't necessary for you to know, he makes sure you know you don't need to be memorizing it, but it's always interesting, relevant stuff. Very helpful, sympathetic if you get sick.",5.0,4.0,Paul Hanson
,"Terrible. Exams were extremely difficult because the lectures involve no actual learning. His lecture style is very dry, unfunny, and not helpful at all. His accent is sometimes incomprehensible.

,"I took ""Exploring Photography"" with her as an introductory class. It's a pretty laid-back class, no homework other than the four major assignments.

,"Dr. Mata is  a great person who really knows his stuff. The problem is, he is not at all tech-savvy.

,"This was a well organized online class, and I learned a lot. My main issue was that I could not reach him by email or blackboard. He rarely responded to messages. Nevertheless, if you follow the homeowner, the quizzes are easy. I did not use any of his lessons during the course so I don't have a comment on that.",2.0,3.0,Edward Wygonik

,He was always glad to answer questions after class and course requirements and expectations were clearly defined.,5.0,1.0,John Kurokawa
,"He has a very superficial understanding of sociological theories and does more preaching than teaching. He teaches with a heavy bias, outdated facts, and outdated materials. However, he is very nice, forgiving, and encourages in class/ outside of class discussions. The midterm/final are given and the class comes with five short papers. Easy A.",2.0,1.0,Les Abrams
,"Very clear instructions, wants everyone to participate. If you read the stories and attend class you will receive a good grade. Makes class interesting and choosing books with great topics. Overall a great professor.",5.0,3.0,Robert Waxler

,"His lectures didn't help with the tests. He lectures from a completely different book. So,  in turn,  his tests are very difficult because he will ask questions about stuff he never lectured on! He gives a lot of homework and there was so much to do that the homework didn't help me understand anything.  I would not recommend this teacher. ",3.5,3.0,Jeff Clasen
,I've had this instructor for 1301 and 1302. He's always willing to answer my questions seriously even answered one in the middle of the night. The test are pretty easy. The essays can be a challenge. But he's always around to help.,5.0,4.0,Kevin Stagg
,"The homework, you will need to fix his spelling errors. Whilst the homework assigned is long, the homework is easy. However you may completely understand the topics being tested yet be cruelly graded.(the general layout of class is efficient and he gives great lectures) No response ->emails, takes too long to open Dropbox too",2.0,3.0,Corey Ptak
,"She allows students to learn bits at a time than at the end bring it all together. After every class, I feel truly inspired by the story she shares that are always applicable to what we're learning. She taught me more than how to be good writer, she taught me how to see the bigger picture in life to take it one day at a time and to fail forward.",5.0,4.0,Paulette Kirkham
,"Professor demanded perfection from students while constantly being late on his promises to the class. He pushed deadline for the final assignment 3 times, totaling two weeks and and kept failing to provide the assignment specs. In the end, he didn't even provide what he had promised and basically said ""too bad."" There were also lectures missing.",2.0,4.0,Keith Jefferies
,"She's great.  At first, she comes off as intimidating, but she is actually very easy-going and approachable.  She tells you exactly what you need to do to receive a good grade in the lab.  Some of the experiments are tedious - obviously not her fault",5.0,3.0,Celina Gwizdala
,"This guy is THE BOMB!  You may often find yourself bored off your ass in his class, but when you tune into his slow, but intent manner of speaking, you realize he is giving you the best advice that you could use as an actor. Work your ass off outside of class, and you won't have a problem coasting by IN class",3.5,3.0,Jonathan Rosenberg
,Everyone seems to give her a bad rap for her teaching. She is a great teacher and you will certainly learn your stuff. She gets a bad rap because people are lazy and dont want to work hard. Lab is tough but extra credit and curves make up for it. Best advice I can give you is make friends fast and study with them. Class is very doable,4.0,3.0,Karen Chooljian
,Worst teacher ever. Literally piles on and I mean PILES on the work. Test are timed in a short period so you get less then a minute on each question and she expects that to be normal. And these are problems you have to write out. Horrible. Do not take,1.0,5.0,Kathleen Conrad

,"ALOT of reading exams could be confusing by the way they were worded Show up to class and take notes and you'll pass, amazing lectures.",5.0,1.0,Lee Maril
,"He was a great professor! His main priority was making sure that you got a good grade. He checks to see if you do your hw or if you just copy the answer key... His tests were pretty easy and if there was something that you didn't know, he will probably tell you what the word meant (even if you were supposed to know it.).  THE FINAL WAS REALLY EASY!",3.0,2.0,Carlos Drumond
,"He's a great professor.  He makes the material easy to understand.  He wrote the book so you do have to spend $ on that in the bookstore, but its easy to follow and homework questions are easy.  Quizzes are based off those. Discussion boards are typical and he stays on top of them.  Gives you months to do the paper.  He really is a good professor!",5.0,2.0,Arnold Smith
,"Chooljian is one of the most difficult professors I've ever had. If you're looking for an easy A, this is not the course for you. Chooljian is very respected because you really have to work to earn your grade. She does not give handouts and will not sugar coat anything, but I will be a better nurse because of how much I had to study for this class.",3.0,5.0,Karen Chooljian
,Great feedback on writing. Very flexible and understanding if you need extra time on assignment. Other students say she is critical but I found her very fair. She pushes you.,5.0,3.0,Jennifer Adams
,He does everything using activities rather than lectures.   I thought that was helpful in demonstrating the concepts in ways that I could see.  It also helped with practice with calculations so by the time the exams came I had done the calculations plenty of times.,5.0,3.0,Corey Ptak
,Took summer course for PHIL 1304. Very clear outline in the syllabus. As long as you participated in discussion boards and did the web assignments on time you should do fine. All quizes and the final were open note. I honestly phoned it in a lot because I was starting a new job during this semester and still made an A+.,5.0,2.0,Ryan McLawhon
,One of the nicest professors I've had. The class is not that hard. If you just show up and listen to the lectures it will make the test really easy. Had a group project but was not that bad. I ended up with a 3.7 and used sparknote for the last half of the semester,5.0,1.0,Amy Spearman

,Listen to me! If you are planning on taking her class RUN! as far away as possible you wont pass. She is the worst professor at Valencia. You will not learn you will write 8 papers every Wednesday. And her test is hard even the multiple choice but majority of her test is open answer and all she talks about is giraffes! Online work kills you! RUN,1.0,5.0,Wanda Jones
,"She is a horrible instructor. She ""acts"" like she doesn't understand you when you sign, and make you do it over and over again. She is the worst ASL teacher at Mesa. She says the students are below what ASL 4 students should be at and says the other ASL teacher are not doing their job. Take some one else!!",2.0,4.0,Melanie Nakaji
,Dr. Harris was an amazing professor! He makes the lectures more interesting and the iClicker questions were a lot of helpful in the class. All of the work in the class was online that way it will make things much easier and more time to work on your other classes and still pass the class.,5.0,1.0,Lee Harris
,Do not take this class! Our Final exam was too long and he sent out an email before the exam saying he knows it is too long and doesn't expect us to finish it in time. Also the exams are very proof heavy. He flips a coin just 10 mins before each exam to decide if he should proctor it. Skip this class if you can.,1.0,4.0,Blake Temple
,"Do not take this class whatever you do. If you want to learn calculus you are better looking at youtube tutorials than learning it here.

,"All I can say is DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF. I took him last semester, his test is crazy hard. NO REVIEWS TEST. A LOT OF HOME WORKS. He said that he have extra credits in EXAM.

,"This is a HORRIBLE professor! Her tests are way too hard for a principles class, she doesn't allow a formula sheet, will not help you if you go to her office for help.

This is the second time Ive taken this class...and there will be a 3rd",2.0,5.0,Raja Bouzouita
,"“Best prof” at Hamilton?  Werner is smug, self-absorbed, and aloof, except to a few of his favorites.  He shows little interest in student opinions.  He plays mind games.  He penalizes students for not meeting his hidden expectations.  That all adds up to one lousy professor.  I got a decent grade from him, but I found him distasteful.  Avoid him.",1.5,3.0,Rick Werner

,"2 papers, one final, journals on books due every class or an outline. LOTS of reading but it is fairly simple.

Participation MATTERS.",3.0,3.0,Kara Keeling

,"Sarcastic and rude.  Does not care about her students and loves to kick people out of lab for any reason she can find.  Wrote up 25 students for academic dishonesty in one semester. Many of which claim was a false accusation and had to get appealed.  Doesn't grade anything on time, doesn't give good directions, and takes off points any chance given",1.0,5.0,Daria Rice
,"Dr. Shively is legitimately my favorite professor or teacher I have EVER had.

,"I don't know what I was thinking taking his class. The class seem okay at first, but after a week it took a big turn. Essays back to back. Even going to his office hours plenty of times, there was NO improvement. He is a harsh grader and he makes it hard to pass. Don't take his class.",2.0,5.0,Dylan Parkhurst
,"Dude, you are teaching an INTRODUCTORY class to ACCOUNTING, one of the toughest subject ever. Students just don't come in and pick up debits/credits or balance sheets right off the bat. He really screwed my accounting GPA over.",1.0,5.0,Jeremiah J. O'Sullivan

,"Unless you enjoy terrible teachers, do not take Dr. O'Gorman's class.  He is as liberal as they come, and he thinks that everyone is a political science major (and he grades accordingly).  I can honestly say that he is the worst professor I have ever had.",1.0,5.0,Mark O'Gorman
,"DEF TAKE. he is kind of slow with replying to e-mails but there is so little to do in this class. 4 quizzes, all non cum, about 5 discussion boards that take not even 10 mins to do. 2 exams, non cumulative. one 8-10 page paper but EASY. exams are easy since half of questions come from the quizzes. I got an A. he has an EC in person meeting, GO.",5.0,2.0,John Doyle
,"This lab professor is not helpful at all.  He always changes his mind so don't believe what he say. Every class meeting, you will need to do your teaching presentation. He would pick on people during their presentation. He expect you to know everyting!!! if he ask a quetion and you don't know the anwer to it, he will lower your grade.",1.0,5.0,Martin Epstein
,"Not the most cogent lecturer and a very harsh grader on homework assignments and exams. That said, perseverance can enable you to do well in his course. Just be sure to rely on Paul's Online Notes as a quintessential supplement to his lectures (which are incidentally copied and pasted from your textbook). Eastern style of teaching/grading.",2.5,4.0,Murli Gupta
,"She is very nice and a good professor. Be sure to take notes of what she says, not just expecting to read from the PowerPoint.

,There were several beginners but most of class had a ton of experience and many were already working in this field yet no one in class came close to knowing what the instructor knew.

,"Jeanette is a great teacher. She made lectures fun and meaningful in real life. The Target project was also a great experience. She was always there for her students to help on the report. Though she can be vague sometimes, I see it as she wanted to guide students toward a right direction, instead of flat-out giving the answers.",4.0,2.0,Jeanette Heidewald

,Expect to receive most of your learning experience by reading the book. I'm upset this teacher talked about everything but accounting for most of class. Homework given but randomly requested back for grading. No study guides for tests. Interested in busting people on cells or talking than more than teaching. Couldn't learn.,2.0,3.0,Connie Wedemeyer
,"easy peasy lemon squeezy. his quizzes are the notes as well as the exam. One page quiz (about 5)and exam (7-8). You don't have to use your brain much, just memorize.

,"Wow, I loved having her this semester. She's sweet and soft spoken, and really knows what she's talking about.

,"If you took Intro to Chem in HS prior to this class, you might want to reconsider! There is loads of homework (online, texbook, lab, etc.) & so much money to be spent all on supplies for the class.

,"I read the reviews for other classes and did not think it described the professor I took, however, I will be honest, She is a very late grader, her communication is not great, and it feels like you are working on the same project the whole semester but, when she does answer she is helpful, her grading isn't terrible as long as you put in the work.",3.0,3.0,Melissa Murata
,"I sm majoring in business so I had to take Macroeconomics. Be warned you have to teach yourself in this class.

,"Best professor I've had here at St. Thomas! Really cares about all her students, super nice, easy, and makes class a lot of fun. I was hesitant to take it as an 8am but she made it go by fast and let us out 10 mins early each time (sometimes more if the weather is nice). Understands this is likely the last Spanish class needed for credit. Take her!",5.0,2.0,Nelly Rios-Freund

,"He is by far the worst professor I've ever seen. He has a very thick accent and I barely understood what he was talking about. Not only he has a thick accent, but he also did not go through the materials very thoroughly. He will explain something without reason, and he expects you to understand the concept. He repeats stuff over and over again.",1.0,3.0,Jiming Wu
,"This is one of the easiest and funniest classes I have taken at college.  He is pretty lenient. Show up for class and participate and  you are guaranteed an A.  I highly recommend this class not only because its fun, but you really do learn a variety of self defense like getting out of grabs and other cool stuff. ",5.0,1.0,Joshua Hughes
,Emily is very kind and sweet. She is a fair grader and helpful if you seek her help. If you are looking for an easy A this ain't the class. You need to do the readings and participate in class. If you do that and you get good grades on all your essays then you'll get a decent grade.,3.0,3.0,Emily Bauman
,100% take this class. So extremely easy and the online textbook is a really amazing learning tool. Super easy and quick grader. I took an online class but I still could feel like he truly cares about his students. The only downside to class was the textbook was very expensive.,5.0,1.0,Dan Baker
,"Mr. Carson is a great teacher that I am taking him again for English 1102. You have to go to class because there will be pop up quizzes over what he used in the powerpoint.

I highly recommend taking this class",5.0,3.0,Alfonso Ippolito
,"Straightforward. Stay on track, and complete the work on time. If you mess up on a project, she allows you to go back and fix the issue. The one gripe I have: the videos you need to watch are excessively long. Teaching material could use an update that's more to-the-point. The online class definitely took 3-4x longer than a reg class would. :(",4.0,3.0,Karen Nearing

,I'm getting A's in all my other courses but did terrible is his. Class is 2 midterms and a final and he's a terrible and unfair marker.

,If you want a class that is easy this isn't it. She is a good teacher and is very helpful during her office hours.

The two downsides to taking her class is she takes a long period of time to grade your assignments and is slow on emailing back.,4.0,4.0,Melissa Murata
,"Profesor Bamford loves Philosophy, and wants her students to learn something. Two papers (opinion-based), a midterm and final. For both tests, you can bring a 'cheat sheet'.

I've emailed him a few times and he usually gets back the next day with an answer.",3.0,4.0,Jonathan Dewald

,"One of the worst professors that have ever had. I was behind, due to a sudden shift in work scheduling  and contacted her through email.

Take this class you won't regret it",5.0,2.0,Trudy Couch
,"Her micro class was the most frustrating college experience I've had so far. Her teaching style was just reading off of a power point, I didn't learn a thing during lectures, or in lab. The only way to survive this class is to memorize the textbook word for word. The tests were ridiculous as well. ",2.0,4.0,Alexandria Gilmore
,"I can say that I barely learned a thing in this man's class. He talked about racism and systemic injustice for 6 classes straight and I learned more about the national news than state government.

,"Plenty of people are saying this guy is great, do not be deceived.

The tests are incredibly difficult and tailored to ensure that you do poorly.",1.0,4.0,Marc Zamkotowicz
,"This teacher has got to be the worst math teacher I've ever had. All of the lectures are on powerpoints- learning math through powerpoints is not ideal and makes things unnecessarily complicated.

Grade comes from online homework and chapter tests, no cumulative final.",5.0,1.0,Wesley Kelm
,One of the best teacher's I've had! I loved all of his classes.. He has a story to go along with every lesson which is extremely helpful. He gives you lifestyle/work tips to carry on for life.

,"The materials that she chose for the class were interesting, but she rarely  gave me any meaningful feedback.  Her grading criteria on major assignments was confusing. Plus, she was not super nice when responding to my questions.  I would recommend buying the textbooks via kindle.  Also, ask a classmate first if you have a question.",2.0,4.0,Stephanie Abraham
,"Raul was awesome! Participate in class and you'll do fine. He assigns a few papers which are reflections so they aren't too difficult. There is quite a bit of reading but to be honest I didn't really read and I did just fine. The two exams are a little bit tougher and you do have to study for them in order to pass. Overall great, nice, fun teacher.",5.0,2.0,Raul Ontiveros
,Bridges is a decent professor who cares about her students and does her best to be available to them throughout the week for any confusions or homework questions.

Another note I can make is that she tends to go off on tangents a lot and sometimes gets confused so be patient.,4.0,4.0,Faith Bridges
,She is very experienced & knowledgeable in her field & tries to make class fun & interesting for her students. Midterms & finals are taken online and she breaks down big projects for you.

,"Dr. Osborne is an amaizng teacher. I had him for ENG 105 and then decided to take his 311 class also.

Lectures are long and not hands on at all.",2.5,3.0,Yvonne Klocek

I can truly say I enjoyed taking this class.,5.0,3.0,Dana Jafroodi

,Such a sweet professor. She takes time out of her evenings the day before a test to give her students a practice test and go over it with them. I really recommend taking her. She calls on you but its okay as long as you pay attention. There are 4 tests and a final. If you put in effort you will do great. One of the best instructors.,5.0,4.0,Margaret Caprara
,"It is my honest opinion that if he was left to run a power plant all by himself, he would find some way to do it.

If you barely pass with a C in one of his classes, you now have a good grasp on that subject.",5.0,4.0,Neil Wahl
,"Really boring. The class is not that difficult, but she has like a million slides and makes you stay almost the entire time. Her accent is a little thick, and she's not that friendly.

,"I had Ptak for intro bio and really liked his teaching style. Very hands-on.

Listen  take notes",5.0,3.0,Craig Dovidio
,"This professor is very knowlegdable but it would be nice if he could communicate well enough to impart some of that knowledge, Communication/language barier is a serious handicap to his ability to instruct. The only people who suffer are the ones who wait in hope that they will soon understand him and then lose their money by the time they realize.",2.0,4.0,T. Popovich
,Honestly this professor seems very good at first. I grew to find that your success is not her top priority.  She is very very strict with criteria and is unclear with instructions. She will kick you out of lab for very minimal things like forgetting to retype a revised procedure. Personally I would avoid this professor unless you are perfect.,2.0,5.0,Daria Rice

IF YOU LISTEN IN CLASS AND LEGIT STUDY, THEN AN EASY A+ :)",5.0,1.0,Devin Gandy
,"Don't take this guy if you are someone that needs organization. Lectures are PPT presentations that are like 120-157 slides long and boring as hell.

,"Wasn't sure at first but honestly this professor really cares and loves his field of study. He has his own sense of humor, loves poetry, vocabulary, writing.

He's cool one on one though.",4.0,3.0,Hank Bordowitz

,"Do not take this teacher. Extremely unorganized and never responds to emails, also barely puts work up on time for online class until half the class emails her so she has to extend the deadlines and make assignments due in 2 days rather than the week. Many long, pointless assignments 10+ pages that she won't grade until 2 months later. Just don't..",1.0,3.0,Maria Hegbloom
,"Barely showed up for this class & passed with an A grade. You can skip his lectures, but DO NOT SKIP review day!

He's also incredibly monotone and difficult to listen to.",1.0,5.0,Todd Moore

,Gupta's idea of teaching is to read the textbook's provided slides while waving his hands around in front of the class as if the students have come in to class knowing the material. Anything that becomes difficult for him to describe is ultimately left out of the lecture. There is also no curve in the class.,2.0,4.0,Murli Gupta
,"I loved his classes! I have taken a few classes with him. The class online is easier due to it being only 3 exams online take him open book. EASY-A both times I took his classes, but his online POS2041 class is easier. Highly recommend, don't believe the haters, ask around.",5.0,1.0,Richard Tapia
,"Professor O'Sullivan isn't really a bad guy, he's not a great professor. If you ask for clarification he'll give it, but whether or not it's actually clearer depends on the concept.

He knows what he's talking about, though.",2.5,4.0,Joseph Donia

If you attend class and put effort into your assignments, you will have no problem obtaining an A in this class. ",5.0,2.0,Stephanie Crockett
,"She is very enthusiastic about what she is teaching. She also always tries to communicate with students in her class and have fun. But the opportunity of getting extra credit is not fair. It is only for those who have the better understanding. Also, you have to prepare to write more words than numbers during the test which was pretty annoying.",3.0,4.0,Jennie Osa
,"Funny guy. He is passionate about the subject matter and as someone who dreaded taking Theology he was still able to make a difference in my life. Read his syllabus carefully because he does not like to go over it a lot or remind of due dates. Go to class, pay attention, and read when it is assigned and you should do well on his midterm and final.",4.0,3.0,Hoon Choi
,"Seymour puts a lot of work down but he's a really cool guy and he gets it and had a smooth transition to online.

,"Took MTH200 over the summer. She talks really fast when she's giving the lessons, but if you're confused, she slows down and explains for you.

He may be uncoventional, but he is a wonderful teacher.",4.5,3.0,Jeffrey McConnell
,"He is a really kind professor. I generally dislike having to read articles and write journal entries, but he made it more interesting and the journal entries were straightforward.

I struggled but was able to pull out a high B. 5 tests and random quizzes sometimes weekly. One chance for extra credit and its an essay.,4.0,4.0,Samuel Perkins
,Professor Jon Dunham cares for his students. If he sees that the class is struggling he will address the issue and help the class out the best he can.

Class is semi-easy, it requires it's own share of studying.",4.5,2.0,Ellen R.M. Druffel
,"If you want to pass the class expect to work for it. He explains everything thoroughly and clearly, but you have to pay attention! (just like any class you want to do well in).

She well help if you ask :)",4.0,2.0,Magdalena Jacobo
,In terms of workload its not hard at all. The 3 agency reports do not have a due date so just get them done when your free.

,Dr. Maril is my favorite prof I've ever had. He gives you the facts to base your own opinions on social problems without giving his own beliefs. The readings are on the test so if you slack off on reading your grade will drop. He does not use powerpoints or BB so you have to go to class to take notes on lectures to study for the exams.,5.0,3.0,Lee Maril
,Hes a great person hes just tough when it comes to grading. Theres never a right answer.,4.0,5.0,Sean Evans
,"One of the best professors at MDC, he truly goes out of his way to help his students. He will give extra credit to boost your grade since not everyone is good test taker.

,"Erika was one of the worst professors I ever had. She's very rude and only lectures. She showed us really boring movies also and I wanted to fall asleep every day in there.

,Mike does not like his students. He acts as though students are idiotic unless they know what he is thinking and he is incredibly disorganized. He has no idea what he wants from his papers and gives grades seemingly randomly. He has ruined my love for literature this class. Discussions are bland and boring and he gets annoyed easily.,2.0,3.0,Mike McLane
,She is difficult. Only give 10 minutes only per quizzes and it's given every week for sure. She takes off points for the tiny things like if you don't put a degree symbol its like 2 points off.

She's a decent teacher to take.",3.5,2.0,Diane Lamkin
,"Dr. King is a great professor! Though at first his module seemed a bit disorganized, he eventually pulled everything together.

,"Whoever said Maria isn't respectful must be talking about someone else. I've taken her 3 times and she Is SO intelligent.

Definitely assigns a lot of work but it's relevant... she is willing to compromise with class sometimes if we aren't happy with assignments.",5.0,4.0,Maria Hegbloom
,Professor Hunt makes interesting topics out of material that many would find boring. I would say that BL432 is one of the most useful classes I have taken. Due to Covid-19 our class was half in person and half online. It was the one class where I feel that I had the same quality of learning online as in-person. Don't hesitate to take it online!,5.0,3.0,Ryan Hunt

,"Dr. Lamkin is super hard. She jumps from first slide to random slides while explaining. Don't take anatomy with 3-4 classes.

Her labs are extremely hard like her lectures! No extra points",2.0,5.0,Diane Lamkin

,"She's a super nice professor and the content is somewhat interesting.

If you like philosophy and want a lot of readings and assignments, then this is the class for you.",2.0,4.0,Jordan Ochs

I would not recommend him.",1.5,1.0,Philip Glauber
,Sister Kirkham is easily the best professor I have had so far. She is so kind and caring and allows you to feel safe in her classroom.

,Dr. King is not a good professor. He is EXTREMELY disorganized and gets lost in the middle of lecture. The PPTs don't help for studying. He sometimes says random things that only confuse us.

,Danny is great! He is clear on his objective's for the class and gives great feedback without making you feel bad. He always has something good to say and he always has critique. He's hilarious and kind. The class is huge and can get boring when people aren't prepared. But you can learn a lot and the scenes are fun. Focuses on drama and simplicity.,4.5,3.0,Danny Campbell
,"Dr. Jacobson is easily one of the best professors at the college. The workload is light. Her lectures are engaging, lively, and fun. At the end of the semester, you'll walk away from the class intellectually stimulated with a wealth of knowledge that's been distilled from her ability as an instructor, rather than from mountains of arduous homework.",5.0,1.0,Jennifer Jacobson
,"By far the worst and most boring professor I have had here. The lectures drag on for hours and it's essentially a compilation of random facts barely stitched together. The two exams are made up from the books, and the notes in class are worthless and confusing. The lecture is mostly just rambling and videos. Do not take for an easy A.",1.0,4.0,Harry Butowsky
,"I loved him! I was in the honors section, so he was my discussion leader and i got to know him pretty well. He's such a sweet guy, bought us all coffee the first week of class.

,"You will lose points if you skip his class. But you dont have any choice but to take his class because he is the only graphic design professor, which is infuriating because his sense of design is so off, he thinks textbooks from the 80s are ideal and has no idea about current trends. he still hasnt let me turn in my 1st project!",2.0,3.0,John Fu
,She gets off topic a lot which causes class to be behind frequently and you must catch yourself up. Easy to follow but tests do get harder as class goes on.

,"Her lectures are pretty interesting, and she always engages the class in discussions about the topics. The only thing I didn't like about this class was the exams, which were on MindTap. The questions were based off of very specific details from the textbook that we never covered in class.",3.0,3.0,Farzin Irani
,"Dr. Choi is such a nice, funny guy! He really makes lectures enjoyable. He explains the dense readings very well. I have honestly enjoyed his class, despite the large amount of course material you will need to know for his tests.

She is picky in her grading but to give her credit, she does state her instructions for the assignments pretty clear.",4.0,3.0,Liz Ann Aguilar
,"Staples is an awesome person, very funny and caring but the amount of work he requires for his micro class is intense.

,"I took her course online for Spring 2016. I'm not sure if it's because I took several years of Spanish in high school, but I found the course extremely easy.

Very friendly!",5.0,1.0,Naicy Pretill
,"Mr. K was fantastic! You can tell he is passionate about art, drawing, and composition. His lectures are filled with rich descriptions of textures or moods to inspire us as we draw.

,The BEST professor ever! I am not a chemistry type of person but he made me love it because his lectures were very understandable. He's a funny guy and is always there for you to reach out to.

,I took the online version over 4 weeks during the summer. He divides the class up into learning modules so it is pretty easy.

He's a good teacher take him.,4.0,2.0,Ryan Brown

If you take this class, study! study!! study!!! Always helps!",5.0,2.0,E. Williams
,"The textbook for this class weighs 500lbs and is thicker than the bible.

Lots of reading quizzes and lecture heavy, but overall a great class if its what you're passionate about!",4.0,5.0,Gordon Burghardt
,I have had Mrs. Wedemeyer for two classes and have done well in both. She does talk a lot off topic but is very caring and helpful. Her class is easy but be prepared to read a little.

,TAKE HIM! He has been at Bentley for so long and he cares about every single student. He really is passionate about teaching but allowing the students to have a space to express themselves.

,The course was awesome. Loved the material and the course set up. What was missing was the teacher. No feedback and when we tried to ask questions he would never get back to us. I honestly could not tell you a single thing about the teacher. the course was great but I would choose a more involved teacher to get more out the class. ,2.5,1.0,David Fawcett
,This class was tough because it was half online and half in class so you had to teach yourself a lot. The material is tough but he tries his best to explain it.

,"If you want rote memorization and an Easy A, don't take his class. But if you want to be challenged like a college professor actually should challenge you, there's no better prof. Discussion based classes where you delve into the deeper meaning of the words on the page. Be prepared to read and have original thoughts.",4.5,4.0,Jeffrey Osborne
,Soh is a really great teacher and takes some time to get used to. She is accessible and will help you in any possible way she can. I learned so much from her class and feel really prepared with my lessons and knowledge of literacy. While at times the class dragged on the information was important and I wouldn't want to take it with another teacher,5.0,4.0,Sohyun Meacham
,Such an amazing professor! Super nice and caring towards her students. Very good at explaining concepts. Make sure to take good notes from the lectures and readings for the quizzes. Only 2 main presentations that you have to give and one is a partner presentation and the other is part of the final project grade.,5.0,4.0,Sarah Holtan
,"Kildea is one of the coolest dudes you will ever come across! He is absolutely hilarious, intelligent and driven. I really enjoyed his class and his feedback really makes you stronger.

,"Dr. Simerka is a brilliant professor. She really knows about what she teachs. If you are one of those lazy students that believe that it is not important to show up to class and do not study, DON'T TAKE HER. If you are one of those students willing to learn, don't put atention to those bad comments about her.",5.0,3.0,Barbara Simerka
,He's a great teacher. His tests are more than manageable if you pay attention during his review sessions. Homework on each chapter and attendance boost your grade.,5.0,3.0,Derek D'Sa
,"Not clear, unapproachable, isn't coherent. His tests aren't feasible. Tests are based off of his lecture notes if you can even call them lecture notes. Instead of being objective in the material he is teaching he likes to throw in how he sees the topic. This class isn't convenient for visual learners.",1.0,5.0,Donald Nelson

,Every review on this is basically a lie. It is 2 months into the semester and not even the final withdraw date yet and 1/4 of my class is gone. If you cannot teach yourself stay away. If you go to him for help he will get annoyed if you don't understand the material. Always cancels office hours. More than half my class is failing with like a 50 avg,1.0,5.0,Kenyon Evans-Nguyen

,"He is a really good professor for REL 102. His lectures are pretty interesting, but attendance is not mandatory. There are a lot of online quizzes before class.

,"The content is interesting but gets spoiled by the teaching. All the material assigned as reading is recovered in class in long-drawn-out ways.

If you do a lot of work you'll do well, but it's a pain",2.0,3.0,Carrie Russell
,"Soh is a great teacher. She really knows what she is doing. I learned so much from her this semester.

All assessments are kinda overwhelming at the beginning, she teaches well and makes you feel confident about them.",5.0,3.0,Sohyun Meacham
,This class isn't exactly difficult although at the end of the semester you are given a news article essay. After waiting three weeks for a grade I was given a 50% after emailing professor Baltodano he was extremely rude and it almost seemed as if I bruised his ego. I ended up falling by .7%. That's right point 7 percent.,1.0,4.0,Bruno Baltodano

,PSY1102 is a self teaching class basically. Prof doesnt do much tbh but shes very kind and accomodating. I once had internet trouble and missed my quiz and she opened it again just for me which is very nice. Bad thing about the course is purchasing the textbook (which is a must) from tophat and its expensive. Lectures are short-uselessjustreadbook,4.0,2.0,Heather Poole

,"Wow for a 4 unit class she sure was a tough grader! ALOT of writing in the class, there is no getting away with writing something quickly-- grammar and thought is necessary to get high marks on analysis. There is a lot of work to do in this class, so if your not prepared to budget time there is no chance in doing well. ",3.0,4.0,Carolyn Holcroft
,Was very helpful and understanding. The class is kind of unorganized because he puts up a syllabus and then an updated syllabus. This is a required course for the cob but I am not sure what the point of it is? And we had to do an MS Office Access project... I took MS Office 1 & 2 in high school and never had to use it so it was really pointless.,5.0,3.0,Huei Lee
,"Mook is a funny guy, he gives lots of homework, sometimes every class, but does this to establish a stepwise pattern of understanding. He is very forgiving, as the large workload results in a lot of dropped homeworks/quizzes. To do well in his course you must spend some extra time to understand all of the material, but its 100% worth the effort.",5.0,4.0,D. Joseph Mook
,I was able to understand his lectures but his labs were pretty difficult for students that just learned about operating systems. His tests are extremely hard and based off only on lectures so take very good notes. Grades hard on labs. Overall just study your butt off and you'll pass the class.,3.5,4.0,Ratana Ngo
,He basically just takes the textbook and turns it into a slide show.  You do not have to go to class.  His lectures put me to sleep.  He is strict no electronics in class.,3.0,5.0,Robert Vaillancourt
,"So overall I don't think she is a bad person. But it has been halfway through the semester and I have only had three grades entered and we submit multiple assignments a week. She also isn't exactly specific on what we are supposed to know, to the point of where I have gone up after class and asked about an upcoming exam and she said ""don't worry.""",2.0,4.0,Kelli Britten
,"Taking him right now, always makes time to help me on my essays.",5.0,4.0,Kevin Stagg
,"Kelli was great, lecture is inclusive and encourages students to participate. Slightly easy grader, as long as you do the work according to the standards.

He's excellent.",5.0,2.0,Mark Lyall
,"I agree with the previous review -- Miller is NOT hard, you just have to do the work.  He's willing to help you whenever you need it and he cares about his students.  He does NOT, however, spoon feed it to you.  You have to be willing to do some critical thinking.  He really cares that his students learn to THINK.",4.5,2.0,Larry Miller
,This software class is very paper heavy. We take tests and quizzes using scan trons and do homework via paper labs. Also be prepared to keep track of your own grades because he never posts the grades online. He would give us our quizzes and tests back for a few minutes and then make us give them back to him. Good luck learning.,1.0,4.0,Alireza Fazelpour

No complaints here.",3.0,4.0,Mary Callaway
,"Great lectures, loved to learn philosophy through Jorgen. Make sure you attend the lectures; they're the most important part of the course. If an option for a smaller class is available, take it.

,"I took Yonn's class in the online format, therfore, my analysis of him as a complete teacher isn't the whole experience, however, in the online format, the workload wasn't bad.

I would say take the class if you have hard time with economics, great teacher but no group work at all, and you dont really know people in the class. sad...",4.5,3.0,Erin Moore
,"This class isn't an easy A but it's not hard. There are usually 3 assignments/week but none of them take very long. There is a 15 hour service project that you have to do to pass.

There is a reason Jorgen is rated good; he is passionate, honest, and inspiring.",5.0,2.0,Jorgen Hansen
,"Dr. Ramey was a very effective lecturer. I expected to learn the basics about each ""world religion"" but he set the class up in a much different way.

Dr. Ramey was awesome!",5.0,2.0,Steven Ramey

Two easy essays a specific topic, prepare to speak (timed) in front of class",5.0,3.0,Susan Mulligan-Heckler
,"I don't understand the complaints regarding the regular quizzes. Very light reading and paying attention in class is all that is needed to do well. I didn't like the use of jblearning labs.

,She is by far one of the worst teachers I have ever had. Not helpful and doesnt seem to care that students have other classes than hers.

,I took him for all my accounting classes at NOVA. Loved his lectures and explanations. Since the classes are usually small he is very open to questions and will take time to help you understand.

,"I took her online nutrition class. Really easy! Every exam and quiz has no time limit and you can take each exam twice. If you have a question though, don't expect too much help.

I recommend him!",4.0,3.0,Patrick McKean
,"Took an online composition class with him, quick 6 week course. Seemed nice enough when I had to email him but didn't follow syllabus well.

Also be prepared to take a lot of notes.",3.0,3.0,Robert Amey

,Her lectures are a regurgitation of the textbook. Instead of explaining proofs she writes duh on the board and moves very fast through material. Tests are extremely hard and she encourages people to withdraw. The only way to do well in this class is if you have seen this material before. This is my 4th math class at Duke & by far the worst.,1.0,5.0,Heekyoung Hahn
,"She is an amazing teacher! She was so easy and I really learned a lot. The test are identical to the review, so as long as you show up to class on the day of the review and memorize it, you'll make a 100. I never made below a 98 on anything in the class. And we got out early everyday.",5.0,1.0,Whitney Hays
,"Her lectures are long, dry, and boring. She is knowledgeable, however; she lacks structure and clarity in both the lectures and exams.

Waste of time and tuition. ",1.5,5.0,Kazumi Hasegawa
,Great!!!,4.0,2.0,Brian McNamara

SHE FORCES YOU EARN IT.",5.0,4.0,Barb Sumi
,"There seems to be a lot of negative thoughts on Meryl and her class, but those of you considering taking her class SHOULD.

Shes understanding, just communicate with her. Shes the best.",5.0,2.0,Meryl Peters
,"I absolutely love Professor Reisinger. She keeps her class engaging; that being said, participation matters.

Overall, a genuine teacher who cares about her students.",5.0,4.0,Deb Reisinger
,"Read word-for-word from Powerpoint so didn't really teach the material. Tests were extremely difficult in comparison to her level of teaching and included trickily worded questions.

If you really want to learn about Database, take this class with him.",5.0,3.0,Amitava Dutta
,Ok she is a tough teacher but unless you are one of her favorites and she does have favorites you will not get any positive feedback from her.

And I'm pretty sure History is more than Social Mobility.",2.0,5.0,John Rossi

Easy A.",5.0,3.0,Ryan McLawhon

Really a rude teacher that sleeps in class and can't teach.,1.0,5.0,Kari Rothi
,This professor is a terrible example of what college will be like.  She doesn't tell her students when assignments are due(and they aren't on the syllabus)and then blames them when work isn't done. She also favors certain students and gives them extra cred for running coffee to her. Complaints have been made on her evaluations but PHSC does nothing,1.0,3.0,Sherri Padgett

,"Took this as a mini-term Spring 2010 (online.) Easy class-only problem I had was the teacher took forever for her to post my grade.

Tests were not challenging.",5.0,3.0,Anna Amundson
,Sanda knows how to design and she's wonderful at that. However she doesn't teach well.

Not for the unconfident people.,1.0,4.0,Sanda Katila

,"While a nice enough guy, Professor Bullock makes it extremely difficult to get any grade above a B.

,Prof.Parker is very sweet. I was sick the first 3 weeks of this on line class and was unable to do a lot of work. She was very understanding and willing to help in any way possible.

,"Very nice professor! I was kind of hesitant about taking her for ENGL 1301 but so happy I did. Before school even started, she sent us the course syllabus and a list of all the assignments and when they were due. She does lecture a lot but it's mainly out of the book. Please buy the book for this class. You will need it! Also, study for the quiz!",5.0,3.0,Liz Ann Aguilar

,"Jiming is one of the best ITM professors at CSUEB. His exams are tough, takes almost the whole class period to finish the midterm and final, but he allows you notes full page front and back which helps a lot. Show up to classes because he gives 3 quizzes unannounced and drops one of them which is 20percent of your grade.",5.0,3.0,Jiming Wu

,"Honestly, easy A if you remember to do all the assignments on BB... which is (not an exaggeration) over 500. At least 5 homework assignments A DAY. Miss something, flat out zero.

,"I only have 350 characters so here's the take-home point: She is EXCELLENT- the class is difficult even if you think you know computers well. It's a lot of work but her grading criteria and assignments are very clearly listed and done in great detail. She puts a lot of thought into her course. Read her posts, do the work, get the A. End of story.",5.0,3.0,Diane Coyle
,"I would not recommend Prof. Ehring to anyone. The material he uses in class is not his own - you can find the PPTs on Google. He reads directly off the slide and gets bored teaching (he announces it in class). Syllabus is not downloadable, was not helpful when I asked for it, grades are not clearly communicated with you. Stay away!",1.0,4.0,Douglas Ehring
,I took this class online. Soooooo much work! I mean I get it it's college but we had 2 or more quizzes every week plus an assignment on top of that. Quizzes only worth 10 points of total grade. A lot of group work too. Would not take another class of hers,2.5,4.0,Laura Hutton

,This professor is spastic and overworked. She does not reply to e mails and has no office hours. Her lectures offer no help on how to teach science and she is often side tracked with off topic stories. She grades hard on senseless things like reflections. Her assignments are not clearly defined. The class was not relevant. I was disappointed.,1.5,4.0,Allison Arnold
,Professor Bonner has to by far be the best teacher or professor Ive had in my entire life. I took him for Calculus 1 and he really cares a lot about the student.

If I were to stay at Cerro Coso I wouldve taken him without a doubt for following classes.,5.0,4.0,Michael Bonner
,"My writing actually improved while taking this class, and I have gotten compliments all semester from other professors on my writing skills.

Loved her!",4.5,1.0,Melinda Sherman
,"Lectures are boring and monotone, do not give specific grading boundaries and guidelines.

,Yikes. He's super passionate about what he teaches and will give you help if you're very specific about what you want but nobody did any of the reading.

It's hard to not get an A and you'll come out with interesting info but he talks through videos which is annoying,3.0,1.0,Hoover Jeffrey
,"DR. G IS AMAZIG. HE MAKES SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS BEFORE HE MOVES ON. HE GIVES WORKSHEETS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE EXAMS. HE MAKES FRESH COFFEE EVERY MORNING AND BRINGS TREATS ON EXAM DAYS.

,"I love Professor Lusk! While her classes tend to be pretty lecture heavy, I generally don't get bored listening to her. Her lectures are honestly quite thought provoking and interesting. She tells stories that make her lessons pretty applicable. Don't skip her class, I relied a lot on what I learned in class for tests. Also she grades pretty easy.",5.0,3.0,Barbara Lusk
,Loved this professor. She had clear criteria of what she wanted. She deeply cares about and loves history and teaches like it. She tries to find cheaper textbooks to save money.

,"I really enjoyed DJB as a person, she is funny and kind. I recommend going to her office hours before tests because they are actually helpful reviews and she will give you practice problems. I thought the class was difficult but thats not really due to her teaching but rather challenging material. Warning, she will cold call on you in class.",4.0,4.0,Donna Johnston-Blair
,"Only thing I really hated about having her as a prof was that she didnt let us have laptops out during lectures. Overall as long as you pay attention in class and MEMORIZE the study guides (they're basically the same as the tests), you'll do fine. She's not a super hard grader on papers but she has a lot of little things she's picky about.",3.0,3.0,Rachael Smith

He lectures and has lab so pay equal attention to both and participate during lab by asking questions and involving yourself in the material; you'll learn and understand a lot by doing so. Would take him again.",4.0,3.0,Matthew Doherty
,"Disregard your textbook.  Bailey tests purely from his notes and what was said (or what he thinks he said) in class.  If you study from his notes, your test scores should be adequate.  He prides himself on his small pass rate.  My class started with approx. 24 students.  We ended with 9 students.",2.0,5.0,Bruce Bailey
,"This was the worst professor I've ever had! not only is he completely unclear about his assignments but he has absolutely no regard for anyone's privacy and he will tell your business to the whole class.

,"She's very nice, and the homework is incredibly easy. But she's incredibly unclear about what she wantsexpects, which can lead to missing a deadline because she wasn't clear about the deadline, and she refuses to take late work (except of course when she doesn't). Nice, but not a college-level teacher. Lots of youtube music videos and an easy book",2.0,3.0,Naicy Pretill

,A lot of reading!!! This class has 2 sections and Prof. Yankwitts taught the content section. She is very caring and understanding especially because of COVID 19.

Her extra credit assignments definitely help!",4.0,4.0,Inna Viriasova

I would 100% recommend him!,5.0,3.0,Theodore Kendris
,"Professor Whitney is a very good professor and I highly recommend her. Sure, she goes off task a bit but in the end if you read and follow your notes you will make a good grade.

,"Helpful, easy, but takes his time grading assignments. A bit disorganized and unpredictable when it comes to posting assignments.

,"Taking her Java class online is one of the worst college experiences I have ever persevered. Her tests and their answers are self-typed, so often answers that she allows are not correct per the book, or one of multiple answers that she presents. When asking for help, she had to use Google to answer a simple question. DO NOT take her Java class!",1.5,5.0,Janet Rowell
,"Professor O'Quinn is an extremely knowledgeable professor who knows what he is talking about.

,"Dr. Teekell is nice and she's pretty relatable, and she didn't go too heavy on the reading or assignments. That being said, she does not give the clearest directions on the few assignments she gives and the rubrics are hard to figure out, so if you misunderstand you lose a lot of points. On the bright side, discussing in class are always a blast.",3.0,2.0,Anna Teekell
,"At first she seems like a hard teacher, but she is so knowledgeable about the topics.  I absolutely loved her class and she made me fall in love with a political science major!

,His passion for the subject in contagious. Explains everything thoroughly and will re-explain anything you didn't understand. Tests are off the power point notes. They're MC and short essays.

,"Take David!  I have had terrible science teacher but David makes things easy to understand and easy to follow.  He reviews everything you need to know.  All you have to do is pay attention.

Overall, nice prof!",5.0,3.0,Andrew Todd
,Kim was a good professor. 3/4 exams (including the final exam) will be graded towards your final grade. She gives out practice exam which is useful. The laboratory for ece is horrible. Too much time consuming. My suggestion is to finish the lab and turned it in to the TA. Most likely you will get full credit by completing the labs.,4.0,3.0,Kim Fitzgerald
,"Hardest class I have ever taken, period. I am a Engineering Major, and this is the worst class i have taken.

,"He has no clear grading criteria, his methods of grading and teaching are all over the place. His PPT slides are 100 each and he jumps around and skips slides, which makes it really frustrating. He only scribbles stuff on the chalkboard when he tries to further explain a concept but still doesn't make any sense. Exams are unfairly difficult.",1.0,5.0,Kai Du
,"I found his class to be challenging because he seemed to be very unclear on what he wants and tends to teach what should have been in the last paper, He didn't really seem fully there and would tell you what to write about for free writes- other classes its free to choose. If you ask him about office hours he says yes but he doesn't seem thrilled.",3.0,3.0,Patrick Walter
,I heard that he was a hit or miss. In reality you better be prepared to work your butt off and see him in his office hours. He is better one to one. His tests are not that hard if you study and show up. He does explain a lot but I personally would not take his class again.,3.5,5.0,Ivie Stein
,Prof Cameron's class has been one of my favorite so far. He is engaging and explains the topics thoroughly. He encourages respectful discussions during class..

,The way she teaches is confusing. She expects you to know how to do problems before she explains them and then when you don't know the answer she acts like your stupid. The class average for the second test we took was 60%. Then she gave us a 25 minute lecture about how we should have done better.,2.0,5.0,Raja Bouzouita
,She is not well suited for her job whatsoever. She assigns very long papers and I highly doubt she even reads all of them all the way. I had my paper given back to me with a grade of 95 (she also circles where the student makes mistakes) and when I was revising the paper I found a couple of errors that she didn't even circle. Did she even read it?,2.5,5.0,Dayna Epley

This class contains weekly readings and several papers. All in all, I truly did learn SO much.",5.0,3.0,Jason Landrum
,"Great teacher. Very clear on the subject, and goes slow to allow all to follow. Answers questions and explains in great detail. The only way to fail this class is to put forth zero effort.

,I took her class on spring semester. Be ready to Give 100 percent of your attention if you miss even a minute you will be lost. Tests are relatively easy if you pay attention in class I recomend you dont miss a day or you will be lost. pop quizzes are given but she gives a heads up. Listen closely because she has kind of a heavy accent,4.0,2.0,Kim Do
,"Feedback on papers was on punctuation mainly, not content. We were writing proof arguments and I never really got feedback on my arguments, if they were weak, strong, well worded, etc. Also, the video put out for each lesson just went over the links in the lesson and showing us those, no insights in how to approach the lesson.",2.0,3.0,Claire Brisson-Banks
,"I like Dr. Schaller a lot and she has inspired me to pursue more studies in Urban Planning.  While her assignments are writing intensive and not always easy, she will take as much time with you as needed to explain. She uses case studies and often challenges her students in a new way.  Some may not appreciate that but I liked the challenge.",4.0,3.0,Susanna Schaller
,"Overall, a really great guy, though not always perfectly clear (especially in-class discussions). Then again, Old English and Chaucer isn't the easiest. Understands a student's workload, and gives extensions with no problem. I would recommend him to anybody.",3.5,4.0,Andrew Taylor
,Just finished taking the class. He is very fair. Was about to quit class but he kept encouraging. Is there early and stayed late if you needed help. He won't give you the answers but helps you work through it. I would def. Take his class again.,4.0,3.0,Kyle Burton
,Paleontology.  Dr. B. is dedicated to science and to her students. Caveats:  Does not like dinosaurs. Tries to pack too much into a 200 level course. Mandatory field trips take up a lot of time but are cool.,5.0,4.0,Katherine Bulinski
,"A friend recommended that I take this class, and so I did and I do not regret it. He is an amazing and brilliant professor.

,Fantastic Professor. He will make you a better writer.,5.0,4.0,Erik Juergensmeyer
,"This is a lecture based class, but you can print the notes he posts online with blanks. Very long winded. Was a interesting class.

He actually enjoys teaching and LOVES when you ask questions!!!",3.5,3.0,Wade Watkins
,"This was the professor that helped me decide that I wanted to go into the sciences. I love his class so much I am taking him again next semester.

Funny too!",4.5,2.0,Stephen D. Smith
,"Useless, grades you based off how other people do. You can do really good on a presentation and he won't have any complaints but you will still get a B. Horribly boring. He basically talks to himself the entire class and makes corny jokes that he thinks are hilarious.",2.0,3.0,Charles Warner
,"She was alright, a bit hard to track down but otherwise she okay. Tests were not truly difficult but you do have to pay attention to the notes and study. If you dont feel ready to take a test she lets you retake it on a different date.",3.0,3.0,Anita Meehan
,"While he is very knowledgeable in the arts, his teaching style is very mundane, so much so that it makes you disengaged in the learning process.

I also found him to be a tough grader, more than he needs to be.",2.0,4.0,Charles Cramer

,"She's very sweet. If you can't be punctual and always attend,don't take her. This class was challenging at the beginning as I was petrified to deliver a public speech. However, it got easier and easier. Practice a lot, study the reviews for the tests, be on time, she likes slides, don't miss a class, pass.",4.0,4.0,Susan Mulligan-Heckler
,"Well upon a good 1/3 of the way through the semester I find these other reviews disturbingly accurate when it comes to treatment for personal views.

Myself and other students have been talking about how we do everything she asks and still get basically a zero...",1.0,5.0,Jordan Ochs
,"Jasmin gets a lot of hate, but he is a solid choice for Orgo. The class is not easy and his lectures are all over the place, but he is hilarious in office hours and is always available to help.

I get to Shamane's class and I'm told that my use of grammar is ""offensive"" and that I'm too ""flowery"" and wordy in my writing. Passed with a 4.0 overall and on the portfolio bc I am a strong writer despite her comments. AVOID HER!!!",1.0,3.0,Shamane Bell
,"Amazing Professor. She is so easy, makes herself be understood. There's a decent amount of homework but its simple but If you do the homework then you have the answers for the quizzes and tests.

She was unwilling to answer questions and her questions are extremely open ended.",2.0,5.0,Daria Rice
,"She is very good, she is easy and she actually cares about giving you feedback on your papers.

Highly recommend her anywhere or to anyone.",4.0,1.0,Michele Randall

,"This was not a core class, but I really enjoyed it. Her class is very easy, but at the same time, I felt like I learned a lot in the process. That's the mark of a good teacher.

,"Professor Liszka makes the her lectures really interesting. She is really professional and passionate about ancient history.

,"Obviously, this class is not even remotely easy (you should know this coming). Material is difficult to analyze and comprehend, and exams are PURELY essay-based regarding book content (he wrote the book). I would say lecture is mandatory, considering.

,"Professor Christensen is a PHENOMENAL professor! He is extremely funny when he teaches, and he is very easygoing. His essays are a piece of cake, and his lectures are interesting.

,"Some of the exam questions on her test were confusing and debatable.

,"His questions in class lingered on and on. Unimportant topics that he had some hidden interest in were just driven. His tests were okay. In the essay portion he wants every single last detail.

,"A friend recommended him, I wasn't expecting to enjoy history this much. He makes everything so interesting and easy to understand.

,"I took Professor McLawhons 5 week online summer course and it was a great choice. His instructions are very clear and he is a fairly easy grader.

I highly recommend.",5.0,2.0,Ryan McLawhon
,Dr. vohs is more focused on getting through the class rather then making sure we no the material. If you try to get help from him in his office he  seems rushed and annoyed.

,"The test are worth 70% of our grade and dont follow his lectures. He promised a large curve and didnt follow through, which was annoying since this class is lecture heavy and moved to be remote. A 1% curve is probably the stupidest thing ive ever seen especially when the average for each of the exam was below a C.",2.0,3.0,James Cooney
,"works as a flipped classroom (lectures for hw, discussion & practice in class), caring and willing to help, funny, tries many different ways to explain things (which is great), sometimes makes lecture videos late but it's not a huge problem, EASY TO UNDERSTAND, tests & weekly quizzes are straightforward and you'll know what to study for.",5.0,3.0,Valerie Burke

,"TAKE HIM. He's super funny and really makes you think about how we handle corrections in america. All quiz points are extra credit so read the chapter before class to get max points! Tests are open note, 1 group presentation, 2 papers about any topic in CJ you want. grades HARD on APA format so beware of that. He makes it hard to NOT pass his class",5.0,2.0,Jose Juarez
,"Best class I've taken at UM. He is a great lecturer, very funny, and very kind. When he asks if you have any questions, he means it; he will stop class to clarify.

,"Professor Robinson was great for me, he responded to my emails, he notified me if my work was not uploading and sent request to resend.

He was very approachable and he gave test guides, so for me I enjoyed him",5.0,3.0,Christopher Robinson

,"Very passionate man about American History. His lectures do get outta hand since he doesn't use a power point or blackboard page. He scribbles everything on a board. Tests are easy though. He gives you 30 concepts and you choose 5 to write about. If you want an easy 'A' I would suggest taking it. Any history book will work for this class, trust me",2.5,1.0,Donald Nelson
,"Bret was a really good professor. You do quite a bit of essays and projects in this class, along with the mandatory student-learning portion. However, the student-learning wasn't as bad as I originally thought and he puts a lot of time and effort into making sure you understand his feedback on your essays.",4.0,2.0,Bret Keeling
,"Not the most difficult class in the world, but tough grader on papers. Show up on time and stay for the whole class to get the most out of everything.

,"My favorite course at Walsh. I kept all books after class ended and still refer to them almost monthly. Do all extra credit including the grammar book.

No joke, I hope you the best of luck",1.0,5.0,Dustin Birch
,"Duba is an awesome guy.  If you ask a question, he will answer it...  for the most part.  He tries to teach you how to find answers for yourself rather than just giving it to you straight.  He wants you to learn, not just to regurgitate information for the final.",4.5,4.0,Charles Duba

,"Not too bad of a class. I already knew most of the information, so that made it easy.

Final was only over three chapters.",2.0,3.0,Breanna Michelfelder
,"By far one of the best professors I have taken. Very relaxed and personable, wants to ensure her students understand the material.

He grades extremely harshly. Not an enjoyable class.",1.0,5.0,Jason Landrum
,Stephen is a horrible prof His grading SUCKS. More than 17 people dropped out of the class and maybe 5 made it to the end with probably 2 actually passing the class If you get a tiny part of like a 10 mark question wrong then the entire question is wrong Its basically impossible to pass unless you have a photographic memory doesnt care for student,1.0,5.0,Stephen Connor

,I'm an A student and got a B+ in the class. Tough grader but not to the point where it's notably unfair. She's an awesome person and super Australian.

,"He is extremely lecture heavy. However, hes just reading from slides that arent even his! When he goes off script, he just confuses the class.

Hes not mean just a bad professor",1.0,4.0,Murli Gupta
,"Craft is no joke. It's hard, no matter who the professor is. Sheffler is very nice, and he is really funny. He will help you if you ask for it.

,"Professor Shields is great fun to talk to and listen to.  He is perhaps just a too laid back. I feel that making the textbook reading option was a real missed opportunity as the book is full of amazing info.  I would like to see his genre class go into a bit more detail from the book. Because of the laidback style, it was tough to prepare for tests",5.0,1.0,Dylan Shields
,"Well, I'll start with the good: Firstly, she's peppy and sometimes makes funny jokes. Yeah, that's about it. She has a pretty thick accent, which isn't her fault, but she speaks so quickly and blasts through so many topics that I always found myself with a dull headache at the end of class. There are NO practice materials and feedback is minimal.",1.0,5.0,Heekyoung Hahn

Small group discussion before class compilation is helpful and fun. She is very clear about grading and her expectations and will love to help you!",4.5,2.0,Kara Keeling
,"Awesome professor, very funny and understanding. Attendance is *not* a grade but she will give you extra credit if your attendance is high - and you're not likely to pass if you skip. Everything she talks about is on the quiz with the addition of one or two things you'll have to read on for the exams. Homework is relatively easy. Easy class.",5.0,3.0,Barbara Lusk

Very unprofessional and her tests have nothing to do with the reading or lecture, which is baffling.",1.0,3.0,Lois Bronfman
,"Mrs. Johnson is very religious and conservative. Shes not afraid to make that known.

I was in high school at the time and looking back, I realized how inappropriate she truly acted.",1.0,3.0,Sandra Johnson
,"Professor Black was decent, but he was very subjective in his grading. I got an A in the class, but  I had to go talk to him before every paper I submitted to fix nit-picky little errors. I also got like 50 percent on the participation points even though I was never late, never missed a class, took good notes, and asked lots of questions.",3.0,4.0,Jason Black

Great experience.",5.0,5.0,Abdelhak Maojoudi

She cares about her students and is a organized teacher. Last thing is the class moves very fast",3.0,4.0,Margarita Casas
,"Lectures are a bit messy, as she jumps from one thing to another and it's somewhat difficult to stay on track. Projects and labs are fine, although take some time if you are not that deep into IT. You still can get an A without even taking the final, providing that you do everything on time.",3.0,3.0,Cynthia Zickos
,"Passionate about the material but she expects a lot and I think she doesn't get French is hard for some,especially talking.  Class was way too big.

Study guides were helpful sometimes but stressful too.",4.5,4.0,Guyomar Pillai
,"Let me just say one thing... I have NEVER met a professor who is so into her classes as Professor Rasowsky is. She is absolutely an inspiration and she enjoys being there and teaching.

,"Unclear criteria in exams. Teaches his own developed tool that doesn't work half of the time and expects you to peform like you are a 10 years experienced developer. Just like any other professor, he is just sweet on the top but will not give you any marks. SKIP SKIP SKIP.",1.0,5.0,Nikolaos Tsantalis
,"Professor Crane is a good professor. She is very sweet and makes the class super easy. She lets the students kind of ""pick"" when they want to turn things in which makes the class easy to pass. She brings in many inspirational guest speakers, which was my favorite part of the class.",3.0,1.0,Claire Crane
,"This professor is excellent and very easy to talk to!  She goes over the material thoroughly and doesn't hold your hand.  She expects students do their work.

Enjoyed it!!",5.0,2.0,Tammy McCullough
,"WORST CLASS EVER TAKEN! This teacher gives NO feedback and does NOT respond to emails; he says to allow up to 5 DAYS to respond to an email?!

I would never take him again, waste of money and time.",1.0,4.0,Christopher Robinson

,AVOID THIS CLASS. He honestly gives so much homework and expects you to follow his answers word for word.

,"The best way to describe him is ""FAIR"". He has clear grading criteria and it is not difficult to do decently well in his class.

Then he gave me a B+ even though I was never late nor absent, and participate every class. I am just confused.",1.0,1.0,Michael Meyer
,He is extremely knowledgeable on this topic and has a ton of real world experience. Do not pay attention to the EGR 106 ratings because they don't know what it means to be in an engineering class.

,Confusing/inconsistent grading. Easy class but not for passionate criminal justice majors. The bare minimum is accepted and received well by the professor. Easy class requires little to no effort.

,"Absolutely loved her!! I highly recommend her classes! I took the six week summer course which is a lot of work at once, but once it's over, it's over.  Quizzes every day, but they are very helpful for the tests, and not all are counted.",3.5,3.0,Dara Whalen
,"This class, like many of the other reviews show, is a complete mess. There is no communication between temple and his TA's which led to one of the 3 graded assignments to be graded wrong. The only assignments worth grades are the 2 midterms and the final. He rambles a lot and goes off topic in lectures. I only learned from the book. STAY AWAY!",1.0,4.0,Blake Temple
,"Lois is a trainwreck. For an instructor of a class with the stated aim of ""open-mindedness"" and ""objective analysis"" of political systems, she does nothing but  opine. This leads to a poor educational environment. I don't know how anyone could or would recommend Lois' classes to anyone",2.0,4.0,Lois Bronfman

,He is a funny and helpful professor. He has a great teaching style. He loves participation and is available to help you if you don't understand. Most of the hw is online but he takes you to the lab one day a week to complete them. His class was very interactive and fun even at 8 a.m. He gives great study guides and you won't regret taking his class,4.5,3.0,Hector Velarde
,Dr. Solano is a good guy. He's not like some of the other professors who just show up and treat each class like a routine. He really wants his students to succeed and will work with you to make sure that happens. Operations Management isn't the easiest subject but Dr. Solano teaches it very well. You'll get an A if you take it seriously!,4.0,4.0,Roger Solano
,she does about a month's worth of lectures and then puts the rest on students. I pay her salary and she sits back and watches. 15 minute presentations from students for 3 hours numbs your mind; we are not professors so it can get quite boring. AVOID HER CLASS AT ALL COST,2.0,4.0,Francine Dagenais
,I figured I'd give Connor a shot since it was at a good time. I went to class the first day and I automatically knew it was awful. She was VERY unclear with her actions and it just overall confusing. I switched out after that. It just was not worth it. I'd pick another class if I were you,2.5,4.0,Evguenia Connor
,"More than half of the class dropped her class and out of 12 of us that were left, about 4 of us had to email the dean about her behavior. On the final she said we have to show work even on multiple choice question b/c if we dont we wont receive credit. Takes points off labs for things such as commas and dots. Also has an envy towards girls",1.0,5.0,Susie Boydston-White
,"Dr. Burridge was fine but this class was definitely dreading. A lot of reading every week, an analysis assignment per week, and the final paper was killing me. This semester was additionally hard because he didn't allow us to choose topics for our final paper.",3.0,4.0,Daniel Burridge
,"avoid her if possible. she seems cool at first but as the semester drags on you'll regret taking her class. her lectures are very unorganized as she goes back and forth through time periods you lose track of which your supposed to be learning and what is just ""setting the scene"".",1.0,4.0,Rebecca Boehling

,If you are not good at math do NOT take him. He skips a lot of steps he feels are common sense but for those of us not good at math are important to understand the material. Quizzes every week. Doesn't answer questions thoroughly. I never felt comfortable enough to ask questions because of the way he responded to others when they asked.,1.0,4.0,Misael Camarena
,"She's so nice! She put up with a lot of goofing off, and kept her composure the whole time, eventually just going with the flow of the class. I didn't learn all that much, but I think that the course is pretty pointless in and of itself...she's really cool though, and in a regular semester would be great to work with.",4.0,1.0,Melissa Steelman
,"Not allowed to stand up at all. NO bathroom, NO eating, NO electronics, including if you wish to take notes digitally.

,"Professor Searfoss comes into class expecting the students to lead the entire thing for an hour and 15 minutes.

Prepare to read a lot and talk about what you read every class period.",1.0,3.0,Lynn Searfoss

Make sure to study precisely and good luck everyone!!",4.0,4.0,Stephen Connor

,"Great course, I highly recommend taking it online! She was very caring and quickly replied to emails. Tons of extra credit opportunities. Weekly quizzes that were easy. Exams were long but she posts recaps on chapters every week that have almost all of the answer in them! Textbook helped a little on tests but rarely used. Only 3 discussion boards.",5.0,3.0,Terry Miller-Herringer

,"PROS: EVERYTHING is on canvas, so you never have to guess what will be on the tests. He is really lenient when he grades the test and lab practicals. He gives you extra credit opportunities. Questions are welcomed. CONS: This summer course is a 4 hour class MTWR, his accent was a little hard to understand. The class requires a lot out of you.",4.0,5.0,Victor Montes-Jordan

,"I had him for 1201 and 1202. He was a funny guy and knew his stuff, but was one of the toughest graders I have seen. If you don't do word for word on his exams, you'll get points off automatically. He'll also roast you if you word a question wrong.",3.0,4.0,Stephen Antonetti
,"IS the most impressive professor at UTTyler, very smart and cares about students ability to communicate and overcome or be ""aware"" of their ability  as a public speaker.

GREAT ROLE MODEL and PROFESSIONAL.",5.0,1.0,Alfonso Ippolito
,Professor Druffel is really caring and wants everyone to pass. The lectures were asynchronous (and split up into sections with mini quizzes at the end) and homework was a weekly quiz with around 20 questions. She was eager for students to show up to office hours and the tests were open notes. I definitely recommend this class.,5.0,2.0,Ellen R.M. Druffel
,Excellent professor. :-) Most CSUSM profs you could leave behind in a dingy Pizza Hut bathroom and not notice the difference. But Dr. Al-Marashi is a true gem.

,"Some of the material is dense but relevant to the discussion. This course builds up on early readings, so make sure to read.

,Smart guy but a bad prof. Doesn't tell you what you need to study. Concepts on exams different from what's on notes and taught in lecture. Just reads off of class notes provided to us. If I had a gun to my head telling me to take him again or jump off a cliff. I'm jumping lol.,1.0,5.0,Stephen Connor

,-Soft spoken & difficult to hear his lectures. He reads off his notes & rarely will offer additional examples or explanations when asked to clarify an idea. Backtracks during lecture which can be confusing. Writes small & slow which eats up a huge chunk of class time leaving little time to explain new material or review hw. +No hw due dates.,2.0,3.0,Jim Logan

,"Prof. Sanders is willing to help. she sent out an email after the final asking if anyone wanted to come to look at their finals and because of this, my grade moved up a letter. her powerpoints are a bit disorganized but I never had trouble knowing what was on the test because it was going to be everything she would emphasize, no surprises here.",4.0,3.0,Barbara Sander

,"GREAT PROFESSOR! He has a sense of humor which makes Philosophy more interesting,not ""serious"". He has a way of explaining concepts that makes them easier to understand than just reading alone.

,"3 exams, basically gives the answers to 75% of the exam, the other 25% you can google on quizlet. Textbook mandatory for HW. Honestly, his accent is really bad.

Tried to do his best with what he was provided.",4.0,2.0,Shanbao Cheng

,Homework is more of a suggestion since it isn't collected and is therefore worth 0% of your grade. Grade is determined by 2 midterms and a final exam. The exams pretty much cover what is in his lectures and lectures are very proof heavy. He often gets off topic talking about physics problems that are loosely related to lecture material.,1.0,5.0,Blake Temple

,"Was not a bad professor, but he is a little hard to understand sometimes because of his accent. He'll call on you randomly, so pay attention. If you pay attention in class, study your quizzes, and do the hw, you'll be fine. There are far worse professors in this course",4.0,2.0,Kai Du

The homework is easy, you just gotta do it!",4.0,3.0,Radhika Reddy

The only reason she gets away with it is because she's the internship coordinator.",2.0,3.0,Sheryl Swingley
,Amazing professor. Yue Lao shi cares about all of her students. You can tell just by being around her that she wants every student to succeed. The workload is what you make of it.

,"Chris is a born teacher.  He's very helpful and down to earth, and he's also very funny.  He goes slowly and breaks down the way to write a paper into clear steps.

,"I've had this professor for two weeks and already, I'm hearing political propaganda that has nothing to do with sociology.

,"Prof. Stevens makes you feel stupid when you ask questions for clarification. For EGR106, he assumed that everyone in the class had previous coding experience so he skipped over the basics which screwed me over because I had to figure it out on my own while doing projects similar to my friends in 300 level classes. He assigns a project once a week.",2.0,4.0,Terry Stevens
,"This is not an ""easy A"" core. Dr. Moore gives pop quizzes (5 points) and they're straightforward IF you read!

Also, make a friend in the class for assignments and help in general - it helps a lot!",3.0,4.0,Todd Moore

,"Llaneza is a nice person.  There is no doubt that he is a kind individual.  But his instructions are hard to follow sometimes.  He expects you to read a lot, too.

Only take if req. by major, I say.",3.0,4.0,Nathan Llaneza
,"When he gives criteria for essays, double every quantity and you'll get a B, guaranteed, if you ever get a grade back for it. If you can avoid him, do so. Sometimes he won't put due dates on things in canvas just so he can copy paste his format and do the least amount of work then canvas doesn't show you have anything to do. He should be fired.",1.0,4.0,Mohamed Islam-Zwart
,Almost all of the grading is based on the exams which can contain very obscurely-formatted questions a lot of the time. All of the lectures are pre-recorded so you can watch them when you like but you must watch them if you want to pass the exams. You're gonna be talked at for 2.5 hours every week and you need to scribble down notes. Very boring.,3.0,3.0,Chris Niemiec

All she does it babble.",1.0,3.0,Cindy White
,"She teaches at a very quick pace and crams a lot of material in. She wants you to go to math lab for more instruction, but that's tough for people w/ jobs and other classes.

,"He is great! His class was focused around ""Fear and Desire in Popular Culture"", so the 3 essays he assigns are on topics that are actually interesting to you.

He's really cool and approachable, and I definitely recommend him.",5.0,2.0,Patrick Walter
,"Professor Gier has been a wonderful instructor. He is eager to help his students succeed but whatever means necessary.

Quizzes are usually 5 short answer questions.",5.0,3.0,Anthony Gier
,"I like Psychology a lot, but it seems like we missed multiple points of the class. Since it was online, all her homework were nice and easy.

You don't know what you have until it's gone. He will almost never fail someone as long as they try. That's something to respect about him, and something to adore",4.0,3.0,Eric Crumpler
,in all honestly she is a good professor but omg she gives out way too many assignments. they are never ending and totally unfair!!! if it wasnt for her excessive assignments she would be a GREAT professor. its like she thinks we have nothing better to do. humanities is BORING!,4.0,4.0,Irma Justicia
,"Many of the questions on the quizzes and tests come from the homework and slides but the final exam had really complicated problems which I struggled to solve. Dont take this class during the summer, it is really fast paced. This is the first C I gotten. Spend a lot of time doing homework and youll be fine",3.0,4.0,Natalia Shkiler
,Quite easy in my opinion. Took this class before and didn't pass took it with Yemut and did amazing not particularly great at math but was really excited when I got an A on a test. Simple do your homework and tests are ALWAYS 25 questions. ,4.0,3.0,Emad Yemut
,My favorite professor of all time! He is so intelligent and really cares for the success of his students. All his exams and quizzes are open note. There is absolutely no way to fail this class. You will learn a lot from him and enjoy doing so! No idea how he doesnt have perfect rating!!!,5.0,1.0,Ryan McLawhon
,"NEVER forget doing her homework or go late to the class, she gets mad when this happens. The tests are okay, but if you have an ascent wrong, you lost all the points for the question. If you wanna learn Spanish, this is not a good class. You will learn only grammar, and this is not important as conversation for a language. Overall, she is 6.5/10",3.0,3.0,Margarita Graetzer
,Easiest stats class in the world. Only thing I disliked about the class was that it took him almost 2 hours to explain something that I understood after 15 minutes. He is extremely detailed and thorough with his lectures. I loved everything about how to class was set up. You're guaranteed a good grade if you pay attention in class and do the hw.,5.0,1.0,Jim Logan

,"I would definitely take professor Lhoest again!  She is a wonderful teacher who is sincerely interested in developing her students in the french language and culture. She gives out extra credit.

,Dr. G's class was great. He lays out a clear path to follow and you just do the work. Writing English at a basic adult level is needed to pass. If you write like a ten year old child then you get a D. Like you literally have to be totally ignorant about writing to fail his class.,5.0,4.0,Ricardo Gonzalez

,"Took this class online. I didn't feel like I had a teacher since I havent talked to her once this semester. It's a good class. Put in the work and you'll be fine. Not going to lie the ""only two exams(midterm and final) is a bit of a gamble. You don't have a lot of recoveries if you fail either exam.",4.0,4.0,Wendy E. Bush
,"Easy class but prepare to write a lot. Three 5-page papers, weekly discussions, quizzes & a group project. The professor is completely MIA. Does not respond to emails or questions & won't grade anything until the end of class. He took points off my first paper & I made the same mistake on all my papers because he didn't grade until class was over",2.0,1.0,Rick Dunham
,"I took this class since the Holocaust is one of my main interests. The class should have been easy for me. However, she goes way too fast for anyone taking notes by hand to write anything down and doesn't like to see anything through anyone else's eyes. She has no formal grading system and is of little to no help on the one paper assignment we get.",2.5,4.0,Rebecca Boehling
,His tests are often confusing and he ends up dropping four or five questions every exam because they are worded awkwardly. There is an immense amount of reading that goes on in this class. If you are not constantly on top of the reading you will fail the exams at the end of every four units. ,2.5,3.0,Bern Lee
,"She has an accent, it is fairly easy to understand, but if you do not have an ear for accents you may struggle. Lectures are pretty straightforward, and I was able to understand the content. If you are bad at math, I do not recommend taking her because she at times is not clear and can move a bit quickly. Pay attention, and ask questions!",3.0,3.0,Evguenia Connor

GREAT class.",5.0,2.0,Jonathan Metzl
,DONT TAKE IT WITH FOWLE..SHE DISCOURAGE YOU FROM BEING AN ENGLISH MAJOR!,1.5,5.0,Elizabeth Fowler
,"She talks for ever in class about the most abstract stuff. Approximately 5 minutes of what she goes over in lecture is on the exams. Inconsistent af, late all the time, exam is 100% based off the book, and you only get a study guide if you're lucky. Never grades things on time. Comes off as super nice, funny, etc. but a bad professor.",1.0,4.0,Keikilani Williams

,"Professor Bonner is by far one of, if not the best math teacher I have ever had. His class is the first math class I have taken where I felt I was not just regurgitating information.

,"Sister Kirkham has been a huge blessing to my first semester here. She genuinely cares about each student & she has a string tugging background.

Learn powerful things w/her",5.0,5.0,Paulette Kirkham
,"This was a diagnosis and assessment course on DSM V. Unfortunately Dr. Meshelemiah is NOT a clinician. A non-clinician instructing this course was absurd. She is a confusing writer and will debate it is your fault for not reading her true intent into ambiguous language. Students have no idea what a writer intended to say, only what was written.",1.0,5.0,Jacquelyn Meshelemiah
,"Dr. Ferrero lectures from her own powerpoints and the class has 4 exams, 1 presentation, and lab/class work. There is a lot of information covered in the powerpoints, so she provides a review for each chapter so you know what to study for. She is very smart and kind. The class has zero surprises. Bio 2 is hard, so you must study!",5.0,3.0,Sunny Ferrero

Trust me, taking him is your best choice.",5.0,2.0,Lee Ritchey

You can bring ur laptop to search the exam questions online. No note taking required for class. Just sit back, relax, & enjoy the class. Easy A & great prof.",4.5,2.0,Brian McNamara
,"Teaches for biology students, not chemistry students. If you are a chemistry major, I strongly recommend some basic biology class first, even though it is not a prerequisite. I struggled with the biology portion. He is a talking teacher and does not write things down for you. Very hard to keep track of all  the new biology vocabulary.",3.5,4.0,Linlin Zhao

,"She's great, honestly. Decent amount of homework, but she really, genuinely cares about you and your work. We had notebook checks which demanded she read 20+ pages of homework for just me, and I found notes and words of encouragement written on every page. She really cares.",4.0,2.0,Anna Teekell
,"Stats is a nightmare but Maojoudi made it easier! A lot of homework, but it is worth it. Attendance is a must. Group quizzes once a week. Three tests. A final project.

Has experience in field. Very passionate about astronomy, clear about what will be on tests, good review sessions. I learned a lot.",5.0,3.0,Charles Nelson
,"McConkey is a great teacher. Interesting lectures and personal stories however he does put that information on his tests, it's helpful to at least get recordings of lectures if you're not in class. Would recommend taking him, would also recommend trying from the start. Each test counts a lot.",4.0,2.0,Dale Edwin McConkey
,Dan was so cool. He's hilarious and keeps the class entertaining. He knows his stuff. I didn't take the class serious at all and still got a C. Be sure to study for the tests.

,"Very long lectures, he talks about the same thing forever. Way too slow paced of a class.

Knows topic, brings in his personal experiences.",3.5,2.0,Lee Jian
,"Overall good teacher. She's excited about her job and that makes her very likable. If you don't do the homework or test reviews, don't expect to pass unless you're a math genius or something. Do the work assigned, ask questions and you'll do fine.",3.5,3.0,Christianne Kurtz

,"Tough, learned a lot.",5.0,3.0,Holly Deeley
,"The average of his exam in our class was a 47% and the average of the final exam was a 51%. Instead of curving the class or giving opportunities for extra points, he wrote a letter to our class saying that he gave plenty of ""free points"" and that we all need to ""be adults"" and take responsibility for our grades. No attempt to rectify the situation.",1.0,5.0,David Stone

,"Mary is a very nice lady and is very brilliant and accomplished. However, she was maybe not the best teacher ever for Intro Enviro Geo.

There is a lot of work that is due each Sunday however, if you are mindful with your time then it shouldn't be a problem.",5.0,3.0,June Lane
,"She might have been having an off semester, but could have given some more feedback. Feedback was pretty sporadic. Assignment due dates were mostly unclear or changed at the last minute.

He is a mess.",1.0,4.0,Yonn Dierwechter

,BOOOOOOOOOOO. Bad professor. Makes a 100 level class way harder than it has to be and offers zero extra credit.

Only need a 50% to pass though if you're okay with a D.,1.0,4.0,Robert Vaillancourt
,"Gerard's class ended up being one of my favourite classes. It takes a lot of work and a lot of creative thinking, but it felt like it was worth it.

Actually there was 5 points* thanks Wendy! but srly, do not take her!!!",1.0,4.0,Wendy E. Bush

He will repeat that throughout semester so students don't stress out.",4.5,5.0,David Smith
,I looked the most forward to attending because I learned a lot and it was 100% worth my time.

,She likes to talk about her family and baseball more than accounting. I only took her again because I know what to expect from her. I've been in 2401 for a week and we haven't had any actual teaching yet. Can't wait for December.,2.5,4.0,Connie Wedemeyer
,She manages to turn an interesting subject into an arduous journey through monotony. Her accent cuts right through you and trying to take notes is beyond frustrating. Ridiculous amounts of reading that really doesn't provide a relevant look at current culture.,2.0,5.0,Katarzyna Beilin
,"Professor McNeil runs a bit late but she always comes in ready to go with a smile on her face. She is an awesome teacher, I would totally recommend her.

,"This was an easy class on the Vietnam War. As a teacher, he will often give out assignments before class but otherwise if you participate, come to class, and do the reading's you will pass. He is also absent a lot, which is nice. It's a super easy Gen Ed class and if you have other hard classes and a busy schedule I would recommend Rossi.",3.5,1.0,John Rossi
,"Out of all the math teachers I ever had Mr. Abdel is certainly the best. Like many people I'm not a genius in math but he really worked with me and I actually understand the problems.

,"He is a tough grader. Expect papers, and group projects. He grades your participation, so if you don't speak up, you'll see it reflected on your grade. The text book is a must. He uses every second of class, so arrive on time. He is a nice guy, just a tough teacher to have.",3.5,4.0,Leonardo Correa
,She acts like everyone in the class is a CPA. Unfortunately she does not take into consideration that everyone is not an accounting wiz. She is very tuff and very unreasonable. She teaches only through PowerPoint and make other people feel like they are stupid. Her final is so difficult that you cant even finish! NEVER TAKE!!,1.0,3.0,Erin Moore
,"I was discouraged after reading all the negative reviews. First of all, this is a self-taught online class. The lectures are there to just further solidify the info. If you put in the work (at least an hour a day) you will succeed. Do not let all these negative reviews keep you from taking this class. Start early, and practice! It is not that bad!",4.0,4.0,Mohamed Islam-Zwart

,I thought this class was effing hard. Hes one of those old school professors who wants you to really learn. 4 months later I've recovered enough to write this review.  I think he is one of the most knowledgeable dudes on campus and he wants his students to be prepared. He has become like a mentor to me and a good friend.,4.0,5.0,Vance Grange
,"Apparently he lost all his money investing in an app that's supposed to teach your goldfish to twerk, so he recently returned to the teaching game after a decade in retirement. Super awesome professor who simplifies advanced content. The only downside is he randomly loses touch with reality and thinks he's in rural Oklahoma birthing a calf.",5.0,3.0,Brendan Williams
,"Her class is fairly easy, but you will have to do a steady amount of writing each week. Usually about 1000 words over three combined discussion posts (minimum 400 for original posts and 250 for 2 replies to other classmates). Her lectures are entertaining and she is quite likable.",4.0,4.0,Rachael Smith
,"I absolutely loved Mrs. Kurtz and the way she taught. I passed this class with flying colors. If you do the homework and practice tests and there's no way you can't pass. She was always so happy! The only bad thing is I wish I would've been told to only buy the online code, instead of wasting 200 dollars on a book that I never even opened.",5.0,3.0,Christianne Kurtz
,"As a professor, not my favorite. As a person she is very nice and easy to get along with. This class was okay. we had 2 essays which you share with the class. No quizzes, but the midterm was hard.

,"Poole is one of the best uOttawa professors! She is very understanding and makes so much time for her students outside of class.

She gets a bad rap because she challenges her students, but I have taken 4 courses with her and I have learned so much from her.",5.0,4.0,Heather Poole
,Dr. Vutha has been one of the best professors I have ever had. The class is tough but Dr. Vutha does everything in his power to help you through it. He is very funny and personable. He holds review sessions before every quiz and exam and he is willing to meet with you anytime about any questions you have and explain them to you. Awesome dude!,5.0,4.0,Amit Vutha
,"Professor Yemut is awful. He doesn't care about you learning, he is hard to understand and leaves class early. He teaches exactly out of the textbook and expects you to do the rest. Test are heavy, but he does give partial credit if you do part of the problem wrong. If you work on your own, you will pass the class, just don't expect him to help.",2.0,4.0,Emad Yemut

,Professor Kim had really long and boring lectures.  He flew through powerpoint slides and didn't really explain concepts well at all.  Never actually had an in-class test until the final so I had no clue what his tests were like until then.  Just was not a good teacher when it came to teaching or testing.  Somehow got a B-.  Would not recommend. ,2.5,4.0,Taek-yul Kim

,"If you have at least a passing interest in world religions and you come to class, this is for you. He does assign frequent reading quizzes from the (cheap) class book but they're easy to skim and ace. Tests are on readings and class discussion, essays and group project (2) not graded harsh. Drops a few missed quizzes and in class assignments.",5.0,2.0,Steven Ramey
,Professor Fritz is the main reason I want to go into education. I had no idea of what I wanted to do at first but I KNEW after taking this class. She can be very laid back but also expects you to put in effort to learn and participate in class. If you want an inspirational professor that genuinely cares about your education then definitely take her,5.0,2.0,Alice Fritz
,"By far the worst professor Ive taken at uno. Gives only grades for 2 test and a final, no homework grades and no quizzes. The test are 2 questions. Doesnt explain his notes and expects you to know the material already.

,"I thought Aren was great at lecturing and keeping it interesting. That being said, gender studies don't always present ""interesting"" content (especially at 9 AM), so you have to actively focus to see the value in this course. If you're willing to pay attention, Aren and this course are both full of valuable insight to almost any given scenario.",5.0,3.0,Aren Aizura
,"Class was canceled often which was good for relaxing, but not for learning.   His lectures drag on and are hard to follow.  His notes are repetitive and all over the place.  I barely used the textbook, which was a waste of money, and it took forever for him to hand back our essays.  If you have another choice, I would take it.",2.0,4.0,John Rossi

He truly loves his job.",5.0,4.0,John Creed
,"There wasn't a single student in class who wasn't in awe with his lecture. He's extremely passionate about his subject, very personable, has a great sense of humor, and very easy to work with.

,"First of all, she knows her stuff and she is quite enthusiastic about it. She encourages participation and cares about the students. On the down side, however, she grades way too hard and she takes too long to get back to you with comments and help. When she does get back to you though, her feedback is excellent.",3.0,4.0,Joanne Freed
,Professor Hetrick lectures the entire class and not on what the topic of the assigned paper is. Very few people get an A and I consider myself a strong writer. Takes forever to grade papers and even longer to pass back for feedback. Only test is the final. Definitely would not recommend. ,2.0,4.0,Kyle Hetrick
,"Dr. Schwartz is a great professor. He is tough, but he truly cares about the material. He has review sessions, responds to emails quickly and will help you if you need it.

,"Young-Chul is the only option for 341 at the moment, but he really is great. He is caring and tries his best to make the dry material interesting. As boring as the class is, it's actually useful.

,"I took her for Social work with Individuals. She is a nice professor but doesnt not explain ANYTHING. She has a hard time getting her words accross because of the language barrier.

,"Don't get me wrong I LOVE Dr. Ingram, but you have to pay attention in his class.

,"Great teacher but, his lectures/test reviews don't line up with the test. You will always have 2 tests every night you have a test excluding the first one. He's willing to work with you and offer extra credit if you're struggling but if you're like me and got over a 100% in your previous class, you should not take this professor.",5.0,5.0,Victor Montes-Jordan
,"Stewart is so hilarious, he has a really dry sense of humor that made an otherwise dull subject matter pretty engaging. I wouldn't advise skipping class, as you'd get behind quickly. I would say that he doesn't give that much feedback on essays, which can be frustrating if you want to improve between draft & final. Very sharp guy.",5.0,4.0,Mark Stewart
,"She was thrown into our class unexpected mid semester and managed to do great. She teaches very well and gives great examples. Her tests are easy if you take really good notes.

Lectures are circular, slow, and if they do end up coming to a point the point is generally something that any breathing human could have gotten to on their own at age 15.

The only saving grace was there was plenty of extra credit available and the discussion questions were easy to do and worth a lot, too.",3.0,3.0,Rebecca McClay
,Worst professor i have EVERRRR had . She does not help you whatsoever. Expects you to know every single thing. On blackboard her power points have atleast 105 slides. EXTREMELY tough grader.

,"Great professor!!!! I had a lot of fun in his class. Be prepared to think, not absorb info. He expects a lot in your witting and expects you to be vocal and participate in class, however, he's a great lecturer. He is always around to help you out and genuinely cares about his students.",4.5,4.0,Karl Qualls
,"He started off the year seeming like a nice guy.. He changed as the year went on, Hes pretty harsh I learned this the hard way. He tries to push his views on you (politics, vegetarianism, etc).

,"Arguably the best professor at Western State.  He is very clear, and it is almost impossible to go through his class without ending up understanding the law.",5.0,3.0,Philip Merkel
,Lectures seem are long but once the class gets involved time seems to fly by. Prof. Aragona is a great professor. I walk away from the class everyday learning something new every day.,4.5,2.0,Tonina Aragona
,"She is horrible. 90% of the classes are spent in unrelated discussions. She waits until the last minute of class to tell us important info, so we end up staying late. She tells you to learn about how to write your paper by reading about it. She is extremely difficult about grammar. She marks off for every tiny thing she can find wrong.",1.0,4.0,Karen Depinto

,"This was by far one of my favorite classes at UofM. The topics discussed will quite literally change your perspective and how you see the world.

Overall, awesome class!!",3.0,3.0,Elizabeth Roberts
,she is a very good professor.,5.0,1.0,Irma Justicia
,"Participation is important to her and will ask you to participate directly. She is enthusiastic about the subject and is very critical of you if you do not do your work. In this manner I think she is caring, she gives at least 2 short essays per week, final is on book of choice. Musts, use the writing center, check your grammar, submit on time.",5.0,4.0,Amalia Rechtman
,"At first I didnt really like Mr. Miller, but over the course of the semester his class grew on me. He gives study guides and practice tests for the midterm and final which is pretty rare as Spanish teachers go. Very open to questions in and outside of class. I highly recommend his class!",5.0,4.0,Adrian Miller
,Boring boring boring Idk if it's because this was online but I was suffering I have ADD so having to sit for 4 hours in her class where she doesn't show power points or anything really visual It's hard to stay focused. She's great for some people but she wasn't it for me It was hard to retain info.,3.0,4.0,. Sarnoski
,"He is the worst professor I've had in my whole college experience. He expects you to go out of your way to see art pieces, know the proper way to critique it, and makes you write so many papers that are pointless and a waste of time. His grading is so hard, it's almost impossible to get an A anything. If you get him as a professor, GOOD LUCK!",1.0,4.0,Daniel McGrath
,"Great teacher -  there was a ton of work to be done in a short time, but Greta made the tough workload manageable.

,"By far the best prof I have run into in my opinion! Easy grader and is very open to giving feedback and help!

,"I loved the readings for this class and the paper assignments had a nice amount of freedom, often allowing students to choose between multiple readings.

,Best prof! Very caring and interactive. Really wants you to do well. You must go to class but it is worth it.,5.0,2.0,Julien Picault
,"He makes sure you know your material, but sometimes he is discouraging. I think his goal is to be the next Dr. Miller. He has an ego problem, and wants things his way or no way, Especially when it comes to senior seminar. His way or your grade will suffer",4.5,5.0,Michael Kovach
,Class has no structure. He comes in with a vague idea of what he wants to teach and he goes all over the place when he starts teaching. Writing on board is all over the place and it's difficult to understand and follow. Has a lot of proofs that he explains once and himself didn't know what was going to be on the exam. Expects us to upper div math.,1.0,4.0,Blake Temple
,"I loved his class! He is a great professor and really knows his stuff! I learned so much in his class, especially grammar, which he is huge on!

,Dr. Walling is a great professor and a good man as a person. I got very sick last spring and he worked with me and gave me enough time to catch up. He was very encouraging and caring for my situation and made sure I do not drop the class. There is room for extra credit. You still need to work hard. I am having him again this fall for ANTH 112.,5.0,4.0,Stanley Walling
,"Pretty easy, despite the other comments. Yea, he reads from the notes, but that means you'll know what's going to be taught and what's on the test. Don't feel like going to class today? Luckily, you'll still have the notes. He's also really good if you go to his office hours or ask questions in class.",4.5,1.0,Phooi Lim

,"He records his lecture so attendance is not mandatory. Overall, I thought the class was very easy. Exams are multiple choice. Make sure you study all your notes and memorize them. Even though I thought the class was easy, I did not do extremely well on all the exams so make sure to do the extra credit which will bump up your grade say from B+ to A-",4.0,2.0,Chris Niemiec
,"I loved taking Dr. Fischer's class. His lectures are very dense and it can get a little boring, but as long as you do the readings and go to discussion it'll be fine. His midterms and final were a bit tricky because they're all free response. You really need to understand the material and expand upon it with your own objections and/or agreements.",4.0,3.0,John Fischer

,"It really seemed like This professor just picked up this class in her spare time, but didn't really care about it. She showed up to our lab section once the whole semester, and for about half of the lectures she brought in guest speakers. The homework was inconsistent and seemed arbitrarily selected.",2.5,4.0,Julie Albertson
,Would not recommend at ALL! HE DOES NOT DO POWERPOINTS HARD TO TAKE NOTES HOMEWORKS ARE VERY HARD AND HE  MAKES YOU WORK FOR EXTRA CREDIT AN WILL NOT  GIVE YOU LOTS OF POINTS!  I ALSO STUDIED  VERY HARD AND ENDED UP  FAILING CLASS,1.0,5.0,Daniel Lee
,"I have taken multiple courses with Dr. Hanson during my years at CLU. I am very sad that he is retiring because I will miss his style of teaching. He is very old fashioned and relies on the basic system of lectures and essays/tests. However, his lectures are always very interesting and most of the pictures he uses from around the world are his own.",5.0,4.0,Paul Hanson
,"My second class with Dr. Crockett in four semesters.  Might be the best instructor in the program, a consensus favorite among students.   Academically rigorous and inviting at the same time.

,"I got an A minus in her class which is surprising to me. She is the most difficult teacher i ever had it was stressful throuhout the whole semester, she takes points off every thing.

It's essential.",5.0,2.0,David Riley
,"classes are all lecture style but he's funny and kind of out of it. 2 midterms and one final, all multiple choice which sucks because each question on the final is basically 1 percent of your grade. homework is online and super easy. he does cold call every class though so be prepared to get called on",4.0,3.0,Derek D'Sa

,"Brent is awesome! I was excited for the class, but it was even better than I thought. We talk about some controversial topics, and get to vote for what you want to talk about during the semester. We went on field trips to the theater too, which was a blast. The class isn't hard if you pay attention and attend.",4.5,2.0,Brent Cowley

,She WILL help you become a better speaker and her assignments will challenge you to think outside the box. She doesn't critique too hard but you will have to work for that A.

Handwriting very sloppy & fast, makes it hard to get problems right",2.5,4.0,Karen Goodwin
,I really enjoyed his class.  Considering it was a Summer math class (17 weeks crammed into 6) I think he did a great job teaching us at such a fast pace.  He is very fair and is always able to help if you need it.  Just do what he says in the syllabus and you will do fine.  He is also very patient compared to some math instructors. He is very nice,5.0,2.0,Jim Logan

,"He's really charismatic and he's not afraid to joke around. There are very few assignments (three short papers, a midterm, and a final) so you NEED to put time into studying for them. We analyzed all sides of Thomas Jefferson and I'm glad that Nelson didn't make TJ out to be a saint. Moral of the class was that TJ was a complex hypocrite.",5.0,3.0,Louis Nelson

,"She's a genuinely a good person. If you go in after class to ask for help you can tell she really wants to help you . However, this means nothing since she is not a native speaker; you literally cannot understand her. She is also unforgivably strict on assignments, and will not accept anything from you if you are even five minutes late to class",1.0,4.0,Misako Van Der Poel

,"Tove was a wonderful professor.

Definitely looked for people to participate, but an extremely fair grader.",5.0,4.0,Tove Rasmussen
,HIghly recommended. I get bored listening to him talk but he has dry humor which keeps me interested. Only write 2 papers and revise them. No tests or quizzes.

,He makes you feel very dumb no matter your question or concern. His test are about 15% of what he goes over in class. Talks about everything that isn't on the tests.

With him its more of a self taught class and A&P is defiantly not the class for that.,2.0,5.0,Jay Schwartz
,There's a lot of group discussion for an online class. First time in an online class I felt like I got to know the other students. That's good if you had a great group like my class was. I can see where it could be bad with a worse group though. Textbook is not necessary.,5.0,2.0,Jason Green
,First day I was scared because I didnt know much about networking. Now I can say I know a lot more than the first day. Make sure you come to class everyday!

TAKE THIS CLASS!",5.0,1.0,Laurie Boetcher
,"She is a good and thorough teacher but this class is so much WORK!! All the reading and homework and participation we need to do is too much for summer.

She helps outside class but intimidating.",5.0,4.0,Guyomar Pillai

,He seems to have stuck with the same processes for years and has never innovated his teaching style or class format. The homework is incredibly straight forward and actually allows you to learn.

Memorize the key terms in the textbook and you should be fine for the final.",4.0,4.0,John Baughman
,"His class is not that easy. Basically he doesn't teaches the course he just tells you go and read it if you don't understand then i will explain. All around the place goes from chapter 5 to chapter 2. Exams are T/F, multiple choices, and 3-4 problems to solve.",2.0,4.0,Jeremiah J. O'Sullivan

,"I know nothing about the prof himself. But his class is good. The videos provided are my saviors. textbook provided. There is a project-type thing due every Monday. Strict-ish on guidelines. Updates grades regular. The tests are the worst part, just because they are timed, and you have to show 100% of your work, so thats hard. id take again tho.",3.0,3.0,Stephen Selph
,"Dr. Miller is awesome! He is good at approaching hard-to-learn biological concepts so that they are easier to pick up. He gives a lot of extra credit, so there's no excuse for a low grade.

,"Professor Keller-Perkins tells you what you need to pass her quizzes, exams, midterm, and final. Do the homeworks, always refer to your notes, and study the examle pictures in the OCR; they will save your life. If you don't understand the material right away, then speak up. The professor will explain it again. Visit the tutors and form study groups",5.0,4.0,Miriam Keller-Perkins
,"Had professor Rice for lab, many people claim to really dislike her, I found that although she is rough on the outside she isn't that cold and heartless on the inside.

,"Tries very hard for his students, genuinely cares about student success. Not a great lecturer.

,"I remember I went to several office hours and she does not know how to answer my questions. She tells me to refer to textbook (which I did prior to attending office hours).

This is why tests are so easy, because she basically uses the textbook to come up with questions",1.5,2.0,Margarida Duarte
,"Robyn is one of my favorite professors I've had! She's helpful, funny, and approachable. She goes above and beyond for her students and that's one of the reasons she's such a good teacher.

,"The class is graded by 10 online assignments, 4 online short quizzes, and 3 in class exams. I recommend purchasing Chegg and the financial calculator he suggests so you can get a 100 on each assignment and quiz and follow along easier in class.

,Mrs. Sieber lecture are long but she make them fun. When she says in the beginning of class that she does not round up grades she means it. I made a C because of this and missed a B by 1 point. She does this because she offers extra credit on the exams. Do all the extra credit and you will be fine. Every point matters! ,3.0,4.0,Leska Sieber

Good guy, awful grader.",2.0,5.0,William Konya

,"Dr. Kuss would be a great teacher if he could actually teach. He is a very intelligent man but he paces back and forth while lecturing, he mumbles everything, and he never looks his students in the eye. Worst lectures I have ever been through.

Be on top of ur grades.,2.0,3.0,Hector Velarde

He is a good teacher, just needs to grade better.",2.0,3.0,Robert Ruder

,"Professor Ratner's class is beyond dull. He stands in front of the class and reads off the slides the entire lecture. 3 exams and 1 project. No room for error.

Dont recommend.",2.0,4.0,Mitchell Ratner

He works out problems by hand, so if you're a visual learner he is your best choice!",5.0,1.0,Samuel Perkins

Three exams, four assignments and a 5 page paper - overall, would recommend taking this class with him.",3.5,4.0,Todd Moore
,I can not say enough good things about Dorthea Michael (aka Mama Michael). She makes lectures interesting and includes class discussions. I took Prof. Dorthea's ENGL 051 class first.

,Do not get me wrong English 1020 is the definition of boring and basic however this professor exceeds even that.

,"Prof. Brown really cares about his class/students. Go to class BEWARE everything was graded based on participation and then the Midterm came out of left field, he was SUPER critical.

,Prof. Rich was the most down to earth professor at York I've met so far. Very approachable. Very funny. Lectures are fun to attend and material is presented and taught in an engaging way.

",3.5,3.0,Katarzyna Beilin

,"What's not to like?  We learn about things we requested from a survey of topics, we watch and talk about films that are fun and interesting, we discuss topics as a class (Not just lecture) and watch clips from good movies and if you do your work you get an A. Class was really great!",5.0,2.0,Brent Cowley
,"He only assigns two tests and 4 essays, so you only have a few assignments all semester to make your grade. As long as you attend almost every class and put effort into your papers, you should pass. He also never cancels class and assigns a bunch of reading, but it isn't that bad. He is really helpful and a good professor though. I'd recommend him.",4.0,4.0,Rob Clausen

His lectured kept me very captivated and he was extremely crystal in explaining details and would be very fluent in the topics discussed.Very easy to approach in office hours but best to ask him in lecture if you can visit him in his office.

,"The change from high school english to the university level is much harder than expected and in my opinion, she did not do a good job with the preparations.

,"Prof. Dierwechter is an academic. He is not there to be your buddy or pal. He is there to broaden your understanding of urban development.

If you appreciate the European model of university level studies, you will love his courses.",4.5,2.0,Yonn Dierwechter
,"Professor Shine is one of the best professor's on campus. The class has only two exams and no other graded material.

He deducted marks for issues his tool itself didn't detect.",2.0,3.0,Nikolaos Tsantalis

,"Dan is amazing, he got me my first internship based off of one assignment. He is inspirational and insightful, his courses are tough, but you just have to talk to him about what your doing.

,"She sets her deadlines for 10:00pm instead of 11:59pm. She won't accept ANY late work even if you have a legit reason and proof. Hands down the worst instructor I've ever had.

,"She's a tough grader, which is bad enough considering she doesn't teach class online. It's basically do it yourself. The deadline is at 10 instead of 11:59pm like the other classes.

He gives about 8-10 short quizzes over a chapter. He will tell you which chapter and the questions are fill in - with a word bank. Study the keywords of each chapter and I'll do well. A MidTerm and Final are only two tests but it's over things covered in the lecture, so take notes. 1 RP and 4 short essays (easy).",5.0,2.0,Jack Goodyear

,"She is AMAZING! You'll miss out on your undergrad experience if you miss out on Yates. You DO have to put work into it...attend lecture, etc. She doesn't test you on anything she hasn't taught you, so as long as you follow her study guides (And study them) you'll be good to go. Again, she gives you these study guides before each lecture.",5.0,4.0,Tuppett Yates

,"Worst I've ever had. She doesn't give any bullet points for the tests, the material is extremely long with tons of new scientific terms. She reviews the chapters AFTER the test is taken, which proves her lack of professionalism. Gives you Ds and Fs no matter how well you do the homework and refuses to give clear explanaitons. She will ruin your GPA",1.5,4.0,Suzanne Young

Isnt afraid to slow the course down if you dont.",5.0,3.0,Adam Meyer
,"Im really bad at math so I was honestly confused the majority of time in this class, his way of teaching was different than what I am used to, and his creation of GERMDAS was even more confusing.

,"Kim is a nice and down to earth guy BUT he never answers emails, he confuses himself when he talks, and he goes through the lecture so fast. The class is a teach yourself course and half online.

,"Okay, relatively easy class.  Proffessor Brandt however does not attend office hours, his quizzes the 'TA's make' are made by the book and are ONLINE (with the answers), and he overall doesn't seem to care about his students.

It's hard to fail!",3.0,1.0,Jolene Lynn
,"He's a bit snooty and pretentious. He has sometimes discredited film as ""art"". The philosophy book you have to read is super confusing.

,"I took Scott for Calculus III during Spring 2018, and he was great. I felt like the tests accurately covered the material that was covered in class, and they were fair.

,Dr. Goodyear is an engaging communicator and fun guy to be in class with.

I highly recommend him for any poltiical science course. I will take him any time I can.,3.5,2.0,Jack Goodyear

I wouldn't want to take her again.",1.0,5.0,Marie Cote
,"BE PREPARED TO READ A LOT! I understand this is college and there will be a lot of reading, but the amount of reading he assigns is crazy!

He respects.,3.5,4.0,Jay Schwartz
,"I tried to give him a chance throughout the year and not be mean on this website but he is  the worst professors i have taken my entire 3 years in college......

,"Unfortunately, I agree with a lot of the other comments -- if I was going to skip a day of econ, it was always Marty's lecture.

,First let me start by saying this professor wants you to think in his frame of mind. Many classmates would not participate because he would shut their answers down. Repeated himself quite often.

,the subject in general is super boring but so is the professor so it doesnt make it easier. Also class is not mandatory which is great but if you have zero self discipline you will never show up again and fail. the tests are all that matter especially the final you could fail everything then get an A on the final and that will be your final grade,3.0,4.0,Steven Fritsche

,"Dr. O is a pretty good instructor. As an admin she's firm but fair unless you are like some of the dummies here who cheat and get caught. Work hard and you pass.

Very poor experience.",1.0,4.0,Kenyon Evans-Nguyen
,"Dr. Schellhorn is a very nice woman and clearly knows what she is talking about, however she think everyone should just automatically getitand if you don't she essentially tells you that you shouldn't be in her class.

He wrote the text and it is a great read!",5.0,3.0,Arnold Smith

,"Dr. Ramey is a solid professor. He knows what he's teaching, and he does it well. It's an easy class, and it's pretty interesting. There are some easy and short essays on the tests. Attendance is ""mandatory"" because we have in-class assignments almost every class that are weighted pretty heavily. Nothing flashy, but not bad at all.",4.0,2.0,Steven Ramey
,He doesn't do much lectures and he gives short examples but most of the time he missed an example that we see in homework that we were not taught yet.

I would totally recommend !!!",5.0,1.0,Stefanie Sertich
,"Professor Tran is SO sweet and passionate about the topic. She has a lot of useful material in her lectures, plus attendance is mandatory, so showing up to class is a must.

,Awful grader. Even if you got every answer right she can still take points off  for millions of reasons.

,Dr Borglin has extreme difficulty breaking down and building up on important concepts. She jumps from one thing to another without explaining the first one.

,"Prof McKean is the only teacher for this course.  He IS hard and says it on day 1.  Marks your papers up and does not take time to help you when you come to him.

""Pay attention in class!""",3.5,5.0,Patrick McKean
,"Padgett is really knowledgeable, but she's hard to parse. I took ENC1101 and 1102 with her, and while it was one of the hardest things I've ever done, I came out better for it. Papers are now easy.

,GREAT professor! Really cares about his student! His class and tests are hard! If you are not willing to put in multiple hours worth of studying or want an easy A do NOT take this class - 3 essay questioned test make up ur grade and 1 extra credit paper worth 10 points which is added lowest test grade- I learned so much! would take again!,5.0,5.0,Robert Turkovic

You would do well to take her class.,4.0,2.0,Dayna Epley

,He is a professor that doesn't care for his student's grades. He gives the same assignment multiple times and is not specific with what he wants so he will take off unnecessary points just because he feels like it. Wouldn't recommend taking him. Also makes you buy textbook and we NEVER used it.,2.0,4.0,Brian Cogan

Often says he'll ""lecture for 30 minutes and then you'll have time to work"" but frequently the lectures lasted much longer, resulting in little in-class time to work & ask questions. Though, he is helpful when you ask questions.",2.5,4.0,Ryan Brown
,"She is a caring professor who is passionate about teaching. The homework assignments were quite easy. There were hardly any tests or quizzes, mainly essays and papers.

,"Honestly, this class was pretty easy. There is only one assignment a week, if that, and we only had 2 big essays. Lectures weren't mandatory and were recorded, all lectures are easy to understand with some tangents. Prof Peters was a tough grader for the essays, but if you do the weekly assignments you should get an A easily! Lots of extra credit.",4.0,3.0,Meryl Peters

,"Reddy is an awesome teacher and is very kind and seems to enjoy biology. The class is fairly easy. Don't skip class because there's clicker questions each class (download the app). Also DO cogbooks because it's a lot of points! The tests can have tricky questions but just really study the lectures and cogbooks and you'll be fine! Easy A, good class",5.0,3.0,Radhika Reddy
,"This class met once a week for about 3 hours or so. He spent each time playing music while talking over it trying to describe which genre the music belongs to but Its incredibly hard to memorize which genre a song aligns to when he talks over it the whole time. Some of his teachings are outdated and when you try to correct him, he gets mad",1.0,3.0,Hank Bordowitz
,"Dr. Callaway is an energetic, engaging professor, and her class was an amazing experience! She was helpful, if a little vague, outside of class, and her paper-comments were honest and helpful. Tough grader on papers, but her focus on participation should boost any ""off"" grades.",4.0,2.0,Mary Callaway
,"3 chapters in the 1st week with 10 assignments that took multiple hours to do each. He lets the book teach, I outlined the chapters & did all the extra problems from the book. He is very strict about the academic code. You have to make sure you re-word everything into your own words. Syllabus & FAQs are frightening. Math was easy.",1.0,4.0,Mohamed Islam-Zwart
,"Prof. Smith is incredibly knowledgeable. While his lectures were informative, at times he went a little too quickly to keep up which made note-taking difficult. Tests and quizzes hold the most weight, but he lets you have a note-card for tests which are a MUST. Make a good note card and you should do well on each test. Overall, a great professor.",5.0,4.0,James Smith
,"This class is easy as long as you stay caught up on all readings. He gives quizzes on random days and he assigns a reading every single time you meet in class. EXPECT TO READ (it's a literature class, duh). You must participate or else he will call you out and he will possibly mark you absent if you do not pay attention when he is talking.",4.0,3.0,Dylan Parkhurst
,"Keeling is a great professor. There is a lot of reading, but it is a literature course, so that is to be expected. You can't really get away with not doing the readings because there is a class discussion of each text as a whole. All in all, the content was interesting and I learned a lot from this course.",4.0,3.0,Kara Keeling
,"Dr. Stone tells you what you will be tested on but in order to succeed in his class you have to do a lot of practice problems. His exams are not straight forward because he likes to challenge his students to make sure they know the material. If you do take him, then do as many practice problems as you can. Quizlet will not help you in genetics.",4.0,4.0,David Stone
,"Professor Stewart in one word: awesome. His dry humor kept me awake throughout this intro level course that I'm sure would otherwise be rather dull. He makes the content engaging and interesting, and is always up for a quick chat during office hours in case you missed anything during lecture. If you get the chance, definitely take Stewart.",5.0,3.0,Mark Stewart
,"Dr. Thompson is good, shes frustrating sometimes but overall her lectures and homework are clear and passing her tests isnt too bad.

,"Dawn was a very hard teacher, she expects you to know all the material already. In class there is 5 mins of instruction and its basically her telling stories about her job that don't connect to what you are learning. Class time is 2 hours of study so be prepared for that. She doesn't teach the material, you will have to learn it on your own.",1.0,5.0,Dawn Zuidgeest-Craft
,"I took Tanoukhi's Epiphany class. Tanoukhi's classes are always a lot of fun because they are discussion driven.

If you're lucky enough, take one of her classes.",5.0,3.0,Nirvana Tanoukhi

,"I loved this class. Liz was a great instructor and as long as you read and ask questions you'll be fine. With papers, the key is having the right GSI or you end up with a problem.

,"The lectures are dry, but, do your best to push through them and take excellent notes... You need to go to lecture to do well on the exams.

Don't waste your money, find them for free.",4.5,1.0,Jonathan Dewald

Got an A in the course,5.0,3.0,Dan Dyer
,"Mr. Prey is one of the best teachers I have ever had. His lectures are interactive, thoughtful, and detailed.

,"His exams are based off his lectures and book, so make sure you attend class and read what you're supposed to and you'll do fine.

,Ala was the best professor I've ever had. She was extremely kind and helpful and really just wants everyone to learn and not be stressed . Her lectures are really good.

I'm planning on taking her for Physics next!,5.0,2.0,Alina Gabryszewska
,"Knows the subject and explains it very well. Grading ambiguous in the beginning of the semester I took this class. It felt as though you had to write EXACTLY what he was looking for--not an easy task due to the expansiveness of the tax code, but he lightened up as the semester went on. Very sarcastic, but you quickly learn it isn't personal.",4.0,4.0,James Richards
,"Dr. Keeling is an expert in her field, but treats students as though they are also experts. Class itself has a lot of work - reading children's books, discussion boards and outlines due every week. Essays are tough just because she is a pretty tough grader and final was tough. Definitely can succeed in this class, but you have to work.",3.0,4.0,Kara Keeling
,Staring at the wall is more eventful than his lectures. He is not very good at presenting information. All his exams are fill in the blank with word banks and attendance sheet is there to be signed every day.,1.5,2.0,E. Williams
,This professor likes to repeat the same thing over and over. She is great but there are many things she could improve on. If you do all the work and put some effort into your presentations you should be able to get an easy A. She treats most of us as high school students so dont miss class and dont be late.,3.0,4.0,Susan Mulligan-Heckler
,"Stagg was a really straightforward guy. I think he was intimidating, but he gave really good lectures. I chose tough grader because he is very specific about how you complete your essays.

,"Simply the best prof you can ask for when taking a difficult course like AP. Excellent at explaining concepts, organized & funny! Has open lab 1X a week to help w/anything.

,"She is very manipulative and plays the good intention card very well, but when it comes down to it, she is mainly concerned with getting people in honors college to meet her quota.

,"He is kind of hard to follow sometimes, unless you really know a lot about the subject before you take it.  His quizes are difficult.  His study guides for his exams are just things you need to know, but he doesn't flat out tell you what is on the test.  Frustrating.",5.0,4.0,David Zlesak
,"Dr. Keeling is such a sweetheart. She's genuinely passionate about her subject, and isn't afraid to let her geek flag fly. You absolutely have to do the reading, and she is a fair but firm grader.

,"He's a tough grader, his tests consist of 3 essays and 5 glossary terms but essays have to be in depth about the content.

,"Please do not be fooled. He is average at best. I took him and his lectures are the blandest thing you will ever attend. Puts you to sleep every time. The only reason I kept going into class was for attendance points. # exams all consisted of learning 45-55 definitions, so if you can memorize it should be an easy A. He is not a good professor.",2.0,3.0,Casey Kleindienst
,"Very fun teacher, hard to understand sometimes. Show up to class, do the projects and you will automatically get 100%. Book is used for very simple online quizzes.

,"BEST TEACHER EVER!!!!!  If ur interactive in class the class will be very interesting. It's what you make out of it because there are a lot of small group discussions.

",5.0,4.0,Melinda Dewsbury
,"He's excellent at teaching. He's also passionate, funny, and caring. I learned a lot from him which I'm very thankful for. Class is usually discussion based, so you MUST show up AND participate.

He's not very available outside of class, although he does ask for questions before every class.",4.0,2.0,Garrett Tyson
,"Every poor review you read about Dr. Kovach is true and I cannot stress enough that no one is exaggerating. His labs were unclear as he didn't give thorough explanations. Remote learning in his class consisted of weekly ""quizzes"", which always had 38+ questions and we really only had the book to study from because his Powerpoints were so vague.",1.0,5.0,Michael Kovach
,"I LOVED Susan! She made everything right to the point and clear for every student.

Her grading process was VERY fair if you actually studied. ",5.0,4.0,Susan Herring
,"Nedd is hilarious. He's so easy, he doesn't know dates so he does not ask for them. If you are not an art history person take him.

,Professor Konya is a good teacher. To do well in his class you better memorize the definitions and proofs in the textbook and lecture. It's important that you adopt to his level of detail when it comes to solving problems. Even if you got the right answer on the hw and you have looked at the answer book it's better to meet up during office hours.,5.0,4.0,William Konya
,I took his online music class and it was an easy A. The content is super easy but the listening quizzes are pretty hard. The strike at the university messed up a lot of things and the grade book was funky for a while. When you email him he usually responds pretty quick but he isn't clear by what he means.,3.0,2.0,John Kurokawa
,"If you want an easy A in this course then Dr. Cote is not for you. She is more difficult than other professors but I believe its because she really wants to prepare us.

,He is good prof.I had the impression he was giving easy assignments so that we get killed in the midterms but was surprised to see he took the assignment and changed the input numbers only.I thought the class was too easy and we would get killed at the final and was wrong.

,"He come across a little too laid back at first and as a result is hard to take seriously until you start getting bad grades.

Make friends and you'll feel comfortable. Highly recommend her as a teach!",5.0,1.0,Meagan Marshall

Attendance is options, but recommended.",5.0,3.0,Royce Decker

If you are a good student this class is annoting.",4.0,1.0,Joe Gonzales

,4 Exams and 1 Research Project. Project is easy and can probably be completely fabricated. He grades the project fair.

,"Easy class. She is super sweet and caring. Took her online & she was always accessible. Only 3 assignments & 2 tests all semester. DO THE ASSIGNMENTS.

Such a laid back class, i would definitely take him again",5.0,1.0,Jerry Law
,"Honestly and sincerely one of the most rude professors I've ever had. His teaching assistant, Kelly Budesa is just as bad. He had 'okay' insight but it felt as if they were only teaching because they needed to. In no way did it seem like they wanted to teach the course and if you asked them, they'd probably admit it. One of the worse profs I've had",1.0,3.0,Ken Hohing

,"The class is very easy in hindsight. The homework is relatively simple and the tests are mainly just rewritten examples in class or homework.

He will re-explain to get the idea across.,5.0,3.0,Ramiro Rodriguez
,"Finishing up my degree at NOVA so I had to take him. He's by far the hardest Spanish professor I've ever had. Very strict/tough grader and assings a lot of homework!

,"Overall great class. The only thing that isn't that great is that there is so much to cover and Dr. Woodfin can't get through it all. Her lectures are informative, but she sometimes goes off on tangents. Always interesting things, but not necessarily relevant. I enjoyed the class and think she is quite kind!",4.0,3.0,CA Woodfin

,"Dr. Schore is the most memorable professor I've had at Davis so far, he made organic chemistry interesting and even enjoyable. He's very clear in lecture and makes difficult concepts easy to grasp.

Class participation is a must but he makes it a lot of fun.",5.0,3.0,Raymond Lavoie
,I am taking her this semester and by far she has taught me the most in any English course I've ever taken. The people who are commenting harsh things are kids who 1) never show up 2) expect a grade to be handed to them 3) didn't try to understand the material. She's very understanding and will help you if you help yourself.,5.0,4.0,Meryl Peters
,"She is a sweet lady. I feel like we only did like 5 essays all semester. We only did like 1 or 3 assignments on the book,so your efforts on your essay will reflect on your  final grade.

,"Generally a very sweet woman. When it comes down to ANT, she's passionate and because she's the chair of ANT, she's pretty serious about her work. Weekly assignments and LOTS of reading from textbook and multiple articles every week. Not a lot of slideshows, mostly lectures. I like her, but I don't like the extensive curriculum. Tough class to pass",3.5,5.0,Deb Altamirano

,"If I could give her 0 stars, I would. I'm confident she grades with her eyes closed as she is consistently late to all meetings and only ever complains about her second job.

I can't describe how horrible she is in 350 characters",1.0,5.0,Edythe Sonntag
,Professor Lorentz is the best! He will proofread essays before due dates and will specify exactly what needs to be changed for an A and he is very understanding.

,"I took him last semester fall of 2015. He's a funny guy, and he knows what he is talking about. Very organized with his lectures. Interesting class. Homework isn't hard and not a lot is given.

I got an A+.",5.0,3.0,David Andrews

,"She will take any chance in class to promote being organic. She talks about her personal life a lot to try to relate to the lesson. There were 3 test and a final.

Art book not really necessary if you take lots of notes.",5.0,4.0,Ted Phelps
,"His lectures don't really explain the material well, and you're better off looking at videos on Khan Academy.

,She deffenetely knows her stuff. I really don't like the way she speaks. She has a big accent and it annoyed me so much. He is one hardworking professor but she demands a lot.

,Staples is a nice guy be expects way too much. Multiple assignments will often be due the same day making it a heavy workload.

He is so willing and nice about any questions you have!,4.0,3.0,Neil Schore
,"Intresting class. Made you think about sports in a different way. Tests were kinda tricky. Put in study time and you'll do well. Average final grade for the class was 81%.

,"I definitely recommend this class and professor. Everything we learned was super interesting, and Prof. Haldane did not overwhelm you with information.

,"I took this class online and it was the easiest math class I have taken to date. The way she set up the course was very efficient and helpful. All the quizzes and tests were at home and gave me a chance to practice for the midterm and final, both of which she gave a study guide for that was very thorough. I would definitely take her again.",5.0,3.0,Wendy E. Bush
,"May seem like a tough class at the start and his teaching style might catch you off guard, but you just gotta actually do the work and read the book! Up until this class, I was skating by giving about 60 percent, but here you gotta give 100, and the Dr. will be more than fair with you if you're honestly trying and STUDYING. Great night course prof.",4.0,3.0,Victor Montes-Jordan

,Very boring lectures even though the prof is nice. It is fairly easy to pass her classes because the exams are all projects. Attendance is mandatory (she makes us sign a paper at the end of the class) but I've worked on other projects in her class while she was talking. Easy A but boring.,1.0,1.0,Francine Dagenais
,"She openly admits to not being good at lecturing and it shows quickly. She clearly has experience but she can't form the sentences to properly share her knowledge. Nice woman, kind of funny, but it does not make up for her flaws. We had one big group project that was near impossible. Tests suck too. Quit now.",1.0,5.0,Judy Wynekoop
,Upper lvl philosophy. Hard. Seemed like the people who really got into it were those more naturally inclined to the subject. First time I wanted to stab my skull with an icepick during class.

Wish I could take more classes with him",5.0,4.0,Jadrian Wooten

,Heavy accent. Prepares nothing. Does everything off the top of his head. Loosely follows the course syllabus. Comes into class exactly on time or a couple minutes late.

His Korean accent, although adorable, sometimes gets in the way of understanding how somethings are pronounced. He also has occasional moments of funniness. He is not the best teacher, but he gets the job done.",3.5,3.0,Young Ko
,"Madame Aunave is one of the kindest professors and long as you participate in class and ask for help when you need it, all she cares about is that you're trying to improve your French. Homework is usually just an activity or two every night that doesn't take longer than 30 min. Only complaint is when she does assign final projects its all at once.",5.0,3.0,Marielle Aunave

As student with ADD this teacher works with me wonderfully.",4.5,4.0,Yvonne Klocek
,I don't get it this teacher is a master at making people think she's something she's not.  What she has been is incredibly rude and just spiteful to me.  Doesn't anyone else see what's really going on?  Shes the reason my husband dropped out.,1.0,3.0,Sharon Banks
,"she is nice, she would like to explain everything you dont understand, but she DO NOT explain a lot on grammar and new stuff, because she think the student can read book and do the questions by themselves. moreover, if you would like to practice more oral , you can go to her class, because there is a presentation in each class, sometimes each week.",2.0,4.0,Christine Petcoff
,"He is a very smart person and knows his stuff but can be a little hard to follow at times. He needs to ""dumb it down"". He has lecture slides that are exactly what he goes over in class so only have to go when there's a clicker quiz. It's difficult material but the old exams are given to you so study those for exams. They are extremely similar.",3.0,4.0,Deni Galileo
,"Dr. Legg was my favorite professor at of all the professors I've had. He relates lectures to real life instances, which have really helped me in my career.

,"This guy is funny as hell and if you talk to him outside of class he will always help you out.  He also reminds me of Joe Pesci and curses almost constanly.

,"I hope that I could give 0 for him. For those who have to take this class, do it wisely. Write your letters clearly, cuz he took points off because you did not write '2' or '5' properly.

,"I took TV production this year and I am learning nothing! Molloy is such a joke for TV and Film. They should call the class, TV production for Dummies. This is a TV, it is square, anything techncal I have no idea how to teach. Talk about a teacher who is crying out for students to like him. Maybe he should change his teaching style and be a so call",1.0,5.0,Brian Cogan
,"Okay first off. Shes pretty cute. But other than that she grades really tough. Only makes one or two comments on papers and deducts 20 to 30 points. Dont even think about talking when shes lecturing, she actually puts your name down then decucts points from participation. She is also a very boring and slow speaker, but shes still hot!",2.5,4.0,Lillian Doerfler
,"Steve is amazing. He takes a legitimate interest in his students and he's super passionate about Classics.

He's awesome; I recommend him for every class you can take.",5.0,3.0,Stephen Maiullo
,"He is amazing and accommodating and he understands that students are overwhelmed so he works around that. His goal is to teach you and help you understand rather than just throwing work at you. He is a great professor and if you do the hw and the practice q's he send, you'll pass with flying colors.",5.0,4.0,John Shon
,"He is a really nice guy, but wouldn't recommend him as a professor. Very tough class, could teach better online, 85% of grade is in exams with little time. I scraped through at the end with a B. Wish he gave more practice exams/material. Lots of people did very, very poorly. His microphone is bad so listening to lectures hurts your ears.",2.0,4.0,Mark McLeod

I reccomend taking her, stay caught up!",5.0,4.0,Erika Nelson
,"Jorgen is one of my favorite professors! You do have to go to class he doesn't upload the slides and so you won't get your notes, and you're going to need notes for the exam.

,"This teacher is a ray of hope for education in this country. He's not like the majority of the educators who only come in for a paycheck.

,"I loved Dr. Grave's energy and enthusiasm, but was not a fan of her teaching style. The class has no real lectures/powerpoints so you basically go to class to do practice questions out of the book with a partner, and have to teach yourself from the book on your own time. If you're taking the class pass/fail its manageable but if not then good luck",2.0,5.0,Toby Graves
,"He gives extra credit worth a whole exam to replace your lowest score. Like the reviews state 3 tests online multiple choice, easy questions, even if you get average scores, the extra credit brings you up to an A. The discussion board was about the budget due until finals week. Easy A class.",5.0,1.0,Richard Tapia
,History is history. You read about it in the book (so boring) and you write a discussion post about it each week. It wasn't hard it's just time consuming because you have to read a lot.

There are 4 online quizzes and 1 open-book final exam.,4.0,4.0,Tang Jingpeng
,Mrs. Prater means well but treats her students like they are children and talks down to them. Expects you to read every night before class and is homework heavy.

One novel every week is tough to get through esp. if you have a heavy workload for other classes but it's worth it",3.0,3.0,Kara Keeling
,Honestly the most unorganized class I've ever had. I feel I could confidently say that about 75% of the class didn't know what was expected of them.

Plus there are the readings which are pointless.,1.0,4.0,Katarzyna Beilin

Thank you.",5.0,5.0,John Alderete

,The one thing I liked about her is that her tests are usually like the review. One thing I didnt like was how strict she was on grading essays.

Her lectures were pretty boring but overall Was nice,2.0,2.0,Sara Cabello Thompson

,"this class is so simple. there is no homework, everything is done in-class or during computer lab. I like her class because she goes through the assignments with you in class and it's easy!",4.0,1.0,Sandy Bolt
,"Interesting class and knowledgable professor. Dr. Browning was good with communication and showed flexibility for my special situation when requested in advance of deadlines. Classwork includes weekly forums, weekly quizzes, and 2 case studies. Quizzes are straight-forward but I felt the case studies could have used some more clarification.",4.5,2.0,Lisa Browning
,"His exams are multiple choice, but very detailed.  His lectues are infomative and entetaining.",5.0,3.0,Michael Baumann
,"Professor Ruder can be boring if you don't pay attention, but is actually a great teacher if you listen even 10%. Class is very easy (He literally codes your homework on the projector in class) as long as you follow along. Knows alot about coding and if you ask more questions he is always happy to help.",5.0,3.0,Robert Ruder
,"The lectures are a lot of fun, the exams, not as much. The exams are tough, you either get it right or completely wrong. Most of it is memorization with some math mixed in. Homework is optional, but you'll end up doing it anyway as they are on the exams. Algorithm Analysis is an interesting topic and I think Dr. Lewis does a good job covering it.",5.0,4.0,Jerome Lewis
,I almost fail this class even I read whole textbook. very difficult. Not recommend,1.0,5.0,John Doyle
,"If you take her online, all she does is link you to Pearson's my math lab. I find it astonishing that she is getting paid to just have a link in blackboard without even making her own slides. If you can teach yourself statistics, its an easy A. I would recommend Doctor Kasha instead -- he is one of the best!",2.0,3.0,Wendy E. Bush
,makes a lot of mistakes. Funny teacher. Likes teaching. Never take it in the morning class.,2.0,4.0,Faith Bridges
,"Great professor and easy class. The lab is mostly a lecture however, pictures and diagrams helped to stay engage and understand the topic. We were always let out early and most quizzes were simple and with cheat sheets.",5.0,1.0,Richard Liebling
,"Easy A in my opinion. If you are a student like me(someone who pays attention in class and reviews their notes for the exam rather than study from the book) you will be fine. If you are a ""dumb"" student, don't take the class. She is the only teacher to give soooo much extra credit at the end of the test, it's crazy. Im in Chem 2 rn and I miss it.",5.0,2.0,Kathleen Conrad
,"Professor Nedd is a great professor. He cares so much for his students. is so attentive and a little awkward. He is one of the nicest professors, he knows so much and is so willing to help!",5.0,3.0,Andrew Nedd
,"Absolutely loved this class. She has a different, hands-on teaching style and is just a really nice person. I would take her again for sure!",5.0,1.0,Lisa Michals
,He was a very nice professor always ready to help his students. He genuinely cared about the well being of the students during this hard time and he always tried his best to simplify things down for students. Office hours are very helpful attend them.,5.0,3.0,Amit Vutha
,Pennell is great once you get to know her! Class can be very boring and difficult at times but she is very understanding with attendance if you email her. There is a lot to do in this class and she will not wait for you to catch up.,4.0,5.0,Greta Pennell
,"This teacher is very easy but she treats us like middle school kids!I feel that she doesnt care if we learn the material as long as we follow directions, make sure u do EVERYTHING when u do homework because if u miss one question she dosnt give you credit at all !! oh and bring your books EVERYDAY even if you dont use them!!!other than that shes ok",4.0,2.0,Magdalena Jacobo
,YOU WILL NOT REGRET TAKING THIS PROFESSOR. I am taking her again for another class!,5.0,4.0,Wendy E. Bush
,"Took him for Chem 1. I thought he was great, his lectures were very organized and he made hard stuff like stoichiometry easy to understand. But I have heard that he is less lenient on Chem 2 students he even said he expects you to know nomenclatures in Chem 2. Just study his lecture powerpoints and practice his practice tests!!",5.0,3.0,Bruce Bailey
,"You eventually get used to his accent and he is a very brilliant man! Pay attention in class and his lectures, and do the hw bc thats where he gets his exam questions from. Get to know him and make sure he knows your name bc he will help you out bc he knows you want to do well. If you show him that you want to do well he will help you!",4.5,4.0,Sudarshan Kurwadkar
,"I found this course very hard and I regret take it because my GPA went down after taking it. The material is very heavy and hard to understand because its not clear about whats the course is! I am in a program of the education department and the course is EDUC, but it doesnt have anything with education. Do NOT take this course, VERY HARD!",1.0,5.0,Patrick Devey
,"She was a fantastic professor who always ensures a good laugh and lots of smiles during class. Very friendly and helpful, and teaches mostly off her powerpoints.  Overall pretty easy course if you show up and pay attention.",4.5,1.0,Callandra Peters
,The class was laid out well so you knew what she excpected and when assignements were do. The tests were very easy and are multiple choice plus if yo get the answer wrong you can try again and get some credit. She was very nice and willing to answer any questions you had. I would take this class again. ,5.0,2.0,Kimberlee Kelly
,"Worst class I have ever taken. Professor is unorganized and does not follow his slides. I can honestly say I've learned nothing in this class. Tests are multiple choice, but don't follow what he *attempts* to teach in lecture at all. Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to.",1.5,4.0,Peter Wejksnora
,"Mollie was super nice! Just take notes, show up to class and you're fine. She reviewed for tests and was very helpful!",4.0,1.0,Mollie Aschenbrener
,This class was 3 hours long and would be pretty hard to stay awake if it wasn't for his lecturing. He always makes a point to keep things interesting and he is pretty funny nonetheless. Minimal assignments and more geared towards lectures and readings. The readings are actually well written novels not dry history books which is a plus.,3.0,3.0,Harry Butowsky
,"I can't judge her as a writing professor, but as a literature professor, she excels. Normally, I look on academic literature classes with dread, but I have to admit her passion for the subject matter pulls you into the lecture. If the entire class participates well/often, you'll have a rich lecture and might even get out early.",5.0,3.0,Rajender Kaur
,"Awful, awful, awful, awful. She goes off on tangents more than teaches the class. I've never had such a terrible professor in my life. All she does is read her ridiculously wordy powerpoints instead of actually teaching, and lectures you on how you should know the material as much as her. Stay away if you can, she enjoys making you feel dumb.",1.0,4.0,Marie Cote
,No Comments,4.0,4.0,Holly Deeley
,"He is AMAZING!! We only had 7 media critiques (at least 350words except for the last one which was 2-3pages), 7 quizzes and online participation on Yellowdig (commenting, posting, liking, etc). I wish I could have taken him in person. If you have a chance to take him, I HIGHLY recommend that you do!",5.0,3.0,Manuel Aviles-Santiago
,"Very unique experience for a class, getting to meet the writers of the books you read. You do have to read the books within a week since you meet once a week but she makes sure the reading load isn't heavy. Also normal class sessions consist of group work every time so just a head's up if you don't really like those. But overall fun and easy.",5.0,2.0,Meagan Marshall
,"Kildea is an awesome professor and chairman. He's super nice and really funny! He can be a bit disorganized, but as long as you study for your tests (READ THE CHAPTERS!!!) you'll do great. He's a good guy to keep in contact with, so make sure you're courteous and nice.",5.0,2.0,Shawn Kildea
,Outstanding in class and out,5.0,4.0,Karl Qualls
,"I have never written a review in my life, but this time I would not let it go, Bruce Cohen has no idea what he is teaching, no material in the class, the class goes by bad jokes and arguments, and he is the most racist Professor in the USA.",1.0,5.0,Bruce Cohen
,Mr. Prunty is really good with helpful lectures to help you pass tests and the class. He cares if you pass his class or not.,5.0,3.0,Bruce Prunty
,"Not the best, but good enough.",2.5,3.0,Kim Fitzgerald
,"Probably the worst class I've ever taken. Lab was awesome because I felt I learned a lot even though he gives A LOT of assignments designed to take over your life and negatively impact your grades in other classes. Never knew what was going on in lecture though and his exams are ridiculous, don't test knowledge, just ability to answer questions BLA",2.5,5.0,Michael Kovach
,Our class got a 43% average on the midterm while Alex Crams midterm average was in the 70's .. she doesn't teach you ANYTHING. Midterm exam was horrible.,1.0,5.0,Deb Fels
,"This class is hard, but Professor Dutta does everything he can to try and give you the opportunity the succeed.  His YouTube videos are a step far beyond what most professors would do.  You should go to class and pay attention.  Doing the practice problem really helps.  Tests are open book, but if you aren't prepared, it won't matter.",4.5,5.0,Amitava Dutta
,he likes to talk and goes of topic very easy. class was boring. we only went over chapters 1-6 in the whole semester!!!! but it was super easy! he doesn't use Wiley plus. final and midterm easy. he gave two quizzes throughout  the semester both were easy and everyone got 100 regardless if you did it right or wrong,3.0,2.0,Brian Hurley
,"Amazing professor! Your grade is made up by 7 quizzes, 1 final, 1 group project, 1 lab project and extra credit. ,Microbiology is a tough subject but he gives you the tools you need and is fair in grading. Responds to emails and answers questions. I would absolutely recommend him!!",5.0,4.0,Roberto Anitori
,This was a pleasant experience. This class was an easy A because the professor made it interesting enough to want to do your best! I loved every week of the course and would highly recommend this class to anyone wanting to take Anthropology!,5.0,2.0,Stanley Walling
,"I do not why MAE dept kept Mook in this department. He basically refuse to provide bare minimum of the content of the course. On top that Mae 340 is a diffcult course. He literally recorded audio for this calculation heavy courses. It is a calculation heavy course, we need to see the math/calculation or order to understand the concepts.",1.0,5.0,D. Joseph Mook
,"This class was not at all what I expected. Reading and writing heavy and Professor Haldane was not an easy grader. If you participate and talk to her via email or for this semester, over zoom she was willing to help. The questions are not at all opinion based, there is always a right answer and if you do not get it you will get a bad grade.",3.0,5.0,Hillary Jeanne Haldane
,"Very serious and straightforward. Don't even try being funny around her. Still, I LOVE saying her name!!",3.0,3.0,Beba Shamash
,Brilliant and very supportive professor.,5.0,4.0,Daniel Olufemi
,He will teach you a lot about San Francisco history but it requires a lot of note taking. I have a learning disability but as long as you take great notes and study you'll do fine in his class.,3.5,3.0,Richard Sammons
,"Took her twice, the only English teacher I want now. Was incredibly flexible, kind, and accommodating. She helped me send a petition to the school to dismiss the failing grade I got on my first year because I explained how anxious I was. Second time I passed with flying colors, and discovered my talent for writing because of her. Favorite teacher!",5.0,3.0,Michelle Blair
,Jagolinzer is an amazing teacher and I cannot imagine taking Corp 1 with anyone else. He definitely picks favorites but it's not hard to become one of them!,3.5,5.0,Alan Jagolinzer
,"Kathy is a great teacher! She does give options for extra credit which is awesome. The class isn't super easy, you have to do the work, but if you do it, you can pass!! If you're confused or having a hard time, she is more than happy to help explain anything and work with you! The labs are usually fun and she comes up with neat ideas to help you!!",5.0,4.0,Kathryn Shade
,"He isn't an easy professor, but he is a VERY good professor. As much as you want an easy class, I've learned so much from him. I worked hard and found his choice of words on exams difficult, but he is so brillant. He really knows his stuff and is more than willing to help students who show an interest in learning. I plan to take him again",5.0,3.0,Mitchell Ratner
,"I have had Dr. Vanderzalm more than once as a professor and she is great.  It is extremely important to attend all of her classes, but they keep you on your toes and her notes system is clear and keeps you engaged.  Make sure you ask questions because it is part of your grade and actually hurts it quite a bit if you don't ask anything.  Take her",5.0,4.0,Pamela Vanderzalm
,"Her projects were really fun and interesting.  she is hard on crafstmanship.  she is really nice and friendly.  tough to understand at times.  contradictory in critiques sometimes.  she grades tough, almost impossible to get an A.  it's possible but very difficult.",2.0,4.0,Mi Sook Hur
,"I personally loved having him for Psych 304, everything was made very clear during lectures and he goes over the problems specifically. His tests are kinda weird bc he focuses a lot on math during lecture but his tests have conceptual idea that need to be explained thoroughly in order to get credit. I recommend honestly",4.0,3.0,Timothy Miura
,"She said at the start the focus was on learning and not on stressing. Barely any homework and the homework that we had was fairly easy. She hates tests so we only had the required midterm and final which were also easy to pass. Otherwise, she was the nicest and coolest professor I've ever had. Definitely would recommend.",5.0,2.0,Alina Gabryszewska
,I took this professor for race and culture 101. He is a very harsh grader and expects you to do above the required amount. He grades assignments very late and finds any reasons to dock you off points. Would highly recommend to avoid him as a professor.,1.0,4.0,Mohamed Islam-Zwart
,"I have had Ms. Walling for 3 classes, and she is AMAZING!!!! Her lectures are  Interesting, she is very helpful, and makes learning the material easier. I would sign up for any class she teachers. She is kind, helpful, and loves to make lots of jokes. This woman deserves an award and/or her own TV show. ",5.0,3.0,Kerry Walling
,"Where to begin *sigh*. I'm a solid student, I make A's. She makes it IMPOSSIBLE to make an A in this course. She does not hold lectures, only Zoom/Webex meetings once a week-which are impossible to get into if you have a life outside of school. She is snarky, she's very picky with how she grades, and you basically teach yourself everything.",1.0,4.0,Kathryn Gronlund
,"If you don't take notes fast, you probably won't get all of them. The lectures are long and if you miss one class, it's like you missed three.",1.0,5.0,Sherri Padgett
,"Very good professor, very inspirational for me. This was my first class I have taken at Oakton, because of Mr. Ragy I kept going.",5.0,2.0,Ragy Mikhaeel
,"take this class i failed english 1101 last semester, not because i was lazy or stupid but simply because the class was hard so i took it again at 9am with dr.venus and i love it. he makes his class interesting and hes so spontanious you never really know what he is going to say next. i like that. his class is not boring and easy. TAKE HIM FOR AN A",5.0,3.0,Wesley Venus
,"I absolutely LOVE Dr. Anderson. By far one of my favorite professors here at LSU. Truly has a passion for Latin which makes it more interesting during class time. He cares more about his students' success than any teacher I've ever had. Tons of in-class quizzes to help your grade. Must be willing to study regularly to get an A, though. ",5.0,3.0,Paul Anderson
,"He is all over the place when it comes to his lectures , he talks really fast and you can never read his handwriting. Its hard to keep up which him when he teaches. Never gets into any real good details in his lectures. At the end of the day, he is passionate in what he does and is a nice and caring person but it can be hard to keep up with him.",1.0,3.0,Bryan Engelhardt
,"This is the teacher to take for chemistry. He explains what are normally confusing topics extremely well. 5 tests, but he drops your lowest test grade. There are also 10 quizzes after every chapter and some extra credit. Take him.",4.0,2.0,Samuel Perkins
,He's really chill. All his classes are fun and everyone learns in his class.,5.0,1.0,William Grover
,"She is an excellent teacher and an overall very kind person. The students who have problems in this class are the ones who do not put forth effort. She doesn't do the work for you, but knows her stuff and will help you until you understand.",5.0,3.0,Janet Rowell
,just the best,5.0,1.0,Stephen Bryant
,"One if the best teachers I've ever had! I learned so much! She teaches it in a way that is understandable, she also uses power points and study guides so you know what to focus on.",5.0,4.0,Angela Currier
,"Good TA, very nice.",5.0,5.0,Charmaine Wetherell
,Mr Wilbrandt is the best teacher I have ever had.  Econ is not a subject that is particularly interesting to me and he engaged me in the topics. He made things related and interesting. I would recommend this class with him to any of my friends.,5.0,3.0,Eric Wilbrandt
,"I took this class online and was much easier! I took Econ 2301 and 2302. I took five classes aside of these and I was able to pass both classes with A's!!! She's a great professor and responds emails really quick!!! If you really have to take this class,I would recommend you to take her online!!! Expect homework cause you will have some. Not hard! ",4.5,1.0,Maria Papapavlou
,"I literally taught myself this class, no joke. I studied and read the textbook for HOURS daily and watched youtube videos. There might as well have not been a professor teaching the class, she reads the powerpoint slides in a monotoned voice, does not really teach. 3/4 of my class dropped and I was one of maybe a few to pass. Do not take her class.",1.0,5.0,Patricia Wilson
,"Very helpful,  understanding.   Firm rules, but that is very  useful, no surprises,  everything is upfront.",5.0,4.0,Adam Dobrin
,"great prof. really shows that he cares about each individual, highly recommend!!!!",5.0,1.0,Adam Gerritsen
,Great guy who definitely understands that this material is difficult.  He is very funny and very laid back.  Good grading system as well. Take him if you can!,4.5,3.0,Rusty Barrett
,"She is such a sweet lady and a great professor. She goes out of her way to help you if you ask for it and genuinely cares. There is a lot of reading required for the class but you'll spend the majority of the class discussing it. There are reading quizzes, a midterm, final and a few papers but if you do the reading you'll be fine.",4.5,3.0,Dorice Elliott
,"I think he is not that much into teaching, and kind of irresponsible. I gave the test for him to regrade, and I never got it back. The materials is hard, and he think we understand everything already, but in fact none of us understand the subject.",2.0,5.0,Ralph Napolitano
,"Yue Laoshi is one of the best professors that I have had at RPI. She genuinely cares about her students and you can tell that she absolutely loves teaching. The class is not hard, per se, but very homework intensive. You have to study a lot and put a bit of time in to the course. If you think this will be an easy A, don't take a class with her.",5.0,3.0,Jianling Yue
,"Presents relevant content with practical application.  Conscientious, generous, invested, knowledgeable.",5.0,2.0,Jennifer Jacobson
,"It is so disappointing that EWU lets this teacher teach at all. I have taken this class at another school and understood it very well, now I am in it here with this teacher and it is impossible to understand or learn anything. He does not grade anything or give any feedback. He also wont work with you on ANYTHING. Avoid this teacher at all costs.",1.0,5.0,Mohamed Islam-Zwart
,"He posts his previous tests online, and he takes his new tests right from there. All his notes are online as well. He goes really fast through the material in class, so it's almost pointless to go. However, the day before exams, he gives you really good hints as to what else is going to be on the exams.",2.0,3.0,Peter Wejksnora
,"Dr. Kim is a nice, funny person, but her teaching is difficult to follow. She rushes through slides, spends lots of time writing mechanisms but that's only 13 of the test. First day she told us that if you make a C or higher in her class, you're doing well. Tried multiple times to meet up with her, but she never made an effort. Avoid if possible.",2.0,5.0,Jisook Kim
,"It's hard to pay attention but try. Generate class discussion amongst your peers, otherwise it'll feel like you're being strung out and left to die of awkward boredom.",2.5,2.0,Angela Carr
,Ive taken Baker also for PSYCH. Ive taken both classes online so its always more work. He added Connect to his assignments but it pays off. I currently have an A in this class and got an A in PSYCH. Replies fast to emails and always gives you reminders and tips. He wants you to pass the class and cares for your well being.,4.0,2.0,Dan Baker
,"Dr. Fan is amazing at what she does. If you dont understand something that she is teaching, she will repeat herself and try to make things clear. If you have never taken an Econ course before, I highly recommend taking her.",5.0,3.0,Qin Fan
,"If you struggled with orgo, don't be discouraged! 425 is much better! Get the book to do his EC. It can bump your final grade by up to 5%. He's a good lecturer & lets you look at your old exams. People say he teaches similar to the ACS. That's a lie. Exam 1 is a lot of chem but bio comes in after that. Go to class for the notes!",5.0,4.0,Linlin Zhao
,"One of my favorite courses that I have ever taken, and I am normally not the kind of guy who likes literature based classes! Dr. Osborne is awesome in leading discussion, and makes sure everyone is engaged. I highly recommend!",5.0,3.0,Jeffrey Osborne
,"most AMAZING professor i have ever taken in my life. she is SO caring. she lets you come in early before the quiz since they are timed. she lets you come for extra help and will explain it until you understand it. she gives extra credit. she explains a&p perfect and gives visual real life examples. most caring, genuine professor that wants u 2 pass",5.0,3.0,Debra Keith-Serafy
,Best prof ive had so far at nyit. I took him last year spring && enjoyed him very much. I wish he taught every subject. Hes hilarious and a great teacher. He can make a caveman understand tmat lol,5.0,1.0,Chet Advani
,"Well if you have to choose between Macintosh and Majumdar...haha enjoy your semester! lol This guy goes through the book. He gives notes, but if you pay attention you can just follow exactly what he is doing in the book. And his examples come from the book...doesn't add much. He is boring and sort of weird.",1.5,2.0,Dipjyoti Majumdar
,"Sanda's class was my favorite one of this entire semester. That said, there are always two sides to things. She's tough and she will tell it like it is. But she's also very light-hearted and funny. Put the work in and do what is asked of you and there are no issues. Fight for your work though. You'll learn so much from Sanda about design.",4.0,4.0,Sanda Katila
,Don't take it out on me just because he didn't give you a good grade.,4.5,4.0,Andrew Taylor
,Hinshaw is extremely passionate about the subject he teaches and wants to transmit that passion to his students. His tests are easy and straightforward and his lecture style is unique but interesting. Great great professor!,5.0,1.0,Stephen Hinshaw
,"10 Tests,6 Quizzes,& Lab points=100. Anatomy is a lot of info, so you MUST be willing to put in time as she does put tricky questions on her tests/quizzes. Pros: You can drop 2 tests (100 points each) & 1 quiz (20 points). Few extra credit on tests. Cons: Very confusing on what she is asking on test/Exams are difficult (I studied a lot).",2.5,4.0,Diane Lamkin
,Maybe it was just my specific scenario but like the last weeks were brutal because all the assignments she had given out were all due the same day and MIND you were all given out the same day. Still a good teacher but not the best experience. She doesn't like hearing whispering so be silent once class starts. Participate or else she gets weird.,4.0,4.0,Alyssa Yankwitt
,"Spectacular prof. He will definitely wake you up at 8.30. I'm not into accounting at all (econ. major), but I loved his class. The homework assignments aren't that tough, he's often in his office, and has very interesting case studies in the wake of corp. scandals. Grading is fair (emphasis on tests). I want Thibodeau as a motivational coach.",5.0,3.0,Jay Thibodeau
,Awesome teacher.,5.0,3.0,Peggy Murnighan
,"I don't get why people have a problem with Dr. Egiseli.  Yes, he expects you to be on time, pay attention, and do thorough accurate work.  In other words he expects that, if you want to be a professional, you behave like one.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I found him responsive and very helpful.",5.0,3.0,Engin Egeseli
,"Speaks too softly, constantly loses control/attention of the class. Questions his own intelligence in front of class. ""Does that make sense?"" You're the one with the PhD. You tell me. Easy classes. Got a B without trying, caring, or hardly even showing up.",2.5,1.0,Wesley Venus
,"Great facilitator... makes you think.  Very fair.  Entertaining, funny, witty, and knowledgeable",5.0,3.0,Jose Soto
,"Prof. K is absolutely an entertaining and helpful teacher. He focuses on composition, and if you focus your art work on composition, you will get an A. As long as you try, he will see that. I thought he was hilarious, and his class was fun to attend. Overall, he's a great professor, I wish he taught more classes at UMBC. He is brilliant",5.0,1.0,Lyle Kissack
,He tries to make his class as interesting as possible. Just show up and study his notes,4.5,2.0,Malcolm Watford
,Hes was a great teacher!! He helps everyone with wutever they need! Hes also a cool person to talk to!!,5.0,1.0,Steve Wilson
,"I thought she was awesome. She's hilarious, has been teaching for multiple years, and she has actual experience in her field in the real world. Make sure to attend every class because if you miss one you may struggle to get back. You're supposed to read the textbook but as long as you are their for notes in class, you'll be fine. Exams aren't hard.",5.0,2.0,Paula Hegner
,Mike's feedback and grading criteria are unclear and subjective. Everything we read was gratuitously sexual and/or violent. The content of the class was honestly disturbing. Mike is not tolerant of the opinions of his students and is downright condescending and rude. My high school English classes were infinitely better.,1.0,3.0,Mike McLane
,"I would NOT recommend Eric for anyone who struggles with math. He is a nice guy, but he really isn't the best teacher. If you are the type of person who can figure out math on your own, he'd be good for you. For those who need extra help and an easier breakdown, he is definitely not for you.",2.0,5.0,Eric Wiesenauer
,"He hadn't taught Bio100 in a long time and it was very obvious that he wasn't as into it like he is with anatomy. Comes prepared, will answer questions. Okay teacher, but not a great teacher, or a bad one.",3.5,4.0,Matthew Doherty
,"Pretty easy course; five discussions, five quizzes, one mid-term, final exam, and one paper. His lectures are bit out-dated and hard to navigate so I ended up learning from the book most of the time. Make sure to stay on top of your paper though because it will creep up on you. Overall decent professor, and fairly solid course.",3.0,2.0,John Doyle
,"Tanoukhi is hands down the most amazing professor I've had. She is extremely philosophical, but that helped change the way I approach literature. She is the most intelligent professor I've ever seen, and her lectures are never boring. I may be biased, but don't listen to the negative reviews. Take a class with her. If you work, you won't regret it!",5.0,3.0,Nirvana Tanoukhi
,The quizzes are really time consuming and require you to really read through the chapters. He makes interesting comments during class. Tests are half based on lecture notes and half based on quizzes.,3.5,4.0,Patrick Brandt
,"You have you to take this guy for any class. He'll get you all ""fired up"" about accounting. Go to his office and talk to him just to say hi, he's so friendly! ""How bout that?!"" P.S. ask him where he goes shopping for his clothing.",4.5,1.0,Jay Thibodeau
,"Be prepared to do A LOT of homework (2-4 MyMathLab sections) and 1 quiz each week! Unlimited attempts with the homework, and 2 attempts for each quiz. Straight forward, the homework and quizzes are graded so heavily that you absolutely CAN pass with at least a C- even if you bomb the exams. DO YOUR HOMEWORK until you get 100%, quizzes based on HMWK",4.0,4.0,Wendy E. Bush
,"Dr. Larson is a fantastic professor. He has been a great advisor.  I am not his assigned advisee, it hasn't prevented him from going the extra mile to ensure I was on the right track. Highly recommend taking as many classes as possible from him.",5.0,4.0,Milan Larson
,No Comments,4.0,2.0,Ravi Adve
,"He is next to impossible to reach outside of class and does not offer office hours. There is no homework besides studying for weekly tests, and he does not accommodate you at all for missing a class. He does not give out any material outside of class so if you missed something he said or missed a paper handed out then too bad.",1.0,4.0,Daniel Wittman
,"I'm another student disappointed that he will not be teaching 494 in the spring. I was looking forward to this. I did 446 with him and LOVED it.

,"Run far away! Although Dr. Simerka is incredibly intelligent, she's very impersonal and her manner can seem very snobbish. This class was really not a great choice.

Then short answer questions which are as difficult to understand as this professor himself,1.0,5.0,George Baranyai
,"Connor's lectures are extremely boring. All he does is read off of slides that he has already put on Brightspace.

The book is needed but no the access code.",5.0,3.0,Leska Sieber
,"It's a hard class but not too hard, I actually got away with doing pretty little work for much of the course. I adore Katia's sense of humor and her sharp, quirky mind.

,Not very helpful. If you want clarification on anything good luck. If he believes he covered it in class he will not help you outside of class regardless of how unclear he was. He skims through the course with a clear low interest in it. Nice enough guy and has a great amount of knowledge just not great at the teaching component.,2.0,3.0,Donald Haidey
,"He's really funny. Tests a LOT on lectures. Takes attendance only like 3 times the semester and gives you points. He lets you know when he will be taking it ahead of time.

,"The way he teaches can be confusing at times, but otherwise the class is fairly easy. Go to office hours to ask questions, he cares a lot about his student's success. 5 Homework is worth 15% (drops lowest), 3 Exams 60%, and Final exam 25%. Use his workbook, it has questions that will help you study.",4.0,3.0,Mark McLeod

Talking helps when assignments are hard.",3.0,3.0,Jude Meche

He also holds study sessions before exams. Exceptional!",4.5,2.0,Eric Wilbrandt
,"Only went to lecture once and got an easy A. The T.A.s will literally review everything on the midterms and final in discussion, so you never have to study for more than two days before the exam. The tests are free response but they give you 5 prompts and you only have to answer 3 of them plus an EC question on the tests. Also discussion quizzes.",4.0,2.0,John Fischer
,Great professor. Interesting. Lots of work but it is an English class. Generous grader and gives you the option to rewrite papers to get better grades.

Gives you 3 absences before he docks points,5.0,2.0,Patrick Walter
,"I got an A in this course, but I don't feel like I learned anything.  The professor seemed nice on the surface.

Expect to feel anxious.",3.0,4.0,Bernadette Guimberteau
,"Polanco made this class more difficult than it should have been.  I had to spend way too much time for her class.  It was a disproportionate amount of time compared to my other classes.

,"Issues are understandable, but this professor does not take his class or himself seriously. The topics he discusses in class do not provide enough information to answer exam questions correctly.

,"Good teacher, funny, his course was easy. Very helpful in the essays. His test is rather hard, but his essays are easy. He takes off point for stupid stuff all the time.

,"You must come to class to get points. She gives you too long on projects, specially in the beginning. You sit there trying to drag your work out for three hours.

Very boring and dull.",3.5,2.0,Linda Richmond

Also 6 free absences!",3.5,2.0,Gloria Chien

Answers I couldn't find, she was helpful about letting me know the answer.",5.0,4.0,Terra Bartee

Most content was in online portal and discussion posts.,2.0,3.0,Sunita Kumari

,"Show up to class and turn something in, you get an A.  He tells you ""you will get an F if you forget to do this"" yet when you don't do it, he still gives you an A.

(He brought donuts on finals day!),5.0,1.0,William Grover
,Enjoyable online class. Very clear outline and grading criteria. Normal amount of reading + HW.

,"Speaks loudly and clearly, and is decent at conveying the material. However, he is unorganized, so the lab time tended to be done ad-hoc. But, this gives you tons of time to ask him questions if you're unsure of something. Also, despite assigning homework frequently, he only collected it as a large bundle twice, so you didn't get timely feedback.",3.0,2.0,Ratana Ngo

If you just need the grade go with Bassett",2.5,5.0,Erin Griffin

Do the work, put 100% in and you will receive an A, hands down.",4.5,2.0,Jayme Feagin
,"Lisa is a tough professor. She expects a lot out of her students. Her assignments are long and detail oriented.

As long as you show you care, so will she.",4.0,5.0,Lisa Beymer

All professors should be like Prof. Dattoolo.,5.0,4.0,Alphonse Dattolo

Take good notes and show up  A.",4.0,2.0,Aren Aizura

Please just DON'T take this class if you want a good grade.",1.0,5.0,Kari Rothi
,"Definitely not worth the hype. The professor was hella dry and I did not find this class interesting at all. His lectures and extremely boring.

I do like though that she always gives you feedback on your assingments,3.0,4.0,Melissa Murata
,"Dr. Stephens is a great professor. An A in her class is definitely rare.

,"At first I really enjoyed the class , but it went somewhat downhill. I learned a lot from the class, but felt that the teacher was judging what people said, even though it is supposed to be a share zone.

,"I did not enjoy his class at all. The lectures are extremely boring and vague. He doesn't give many assignments but when he does, he grades them toughly. So if you do take this class, I recommend putting lots of detail into your papers. Also the mid term and final are 50 min and difficult and out of 54 people, 2 got an A on the midterm. Good luck!",2.0,4.0,Steven Bullock
,"His topics are interesting. Sometimes, they're off topic but they're related to the subj. His explanations are well-thought of.

If her classes are not mandatory, I strongly recommend that you not take them.",1.5,4.0,Kazumi Hasegawa
,"She would try to engage the class, but I don't think teaching is her strong point. The online Cengage program is ridiculous, the textbook reads like it's catered towards high schoolers, but the material in the exams online is nothing like what we learned. I barely passed them, despite having a strong interest and background in abnormal psychology.",2.0,4.0,Farzin Irani

,"The WORST Math teacher I have ever had. Highly not recommended if you want to pass the class and not destroy your GPA. Do not answer questions clearly.

Also, imposes you how to write ( printed and not cursive).",1.0,4.0,William Konya
,DO NOT take Nicastro unless you absolutely have to. He knows his stuff but is horrible in actually iterating it to his students. And don't get me started on his tests.

Participate and it's fine!",2.5,3.0,Nicole Pekarske

,"Teach yourself the stuff. he teaches his class with videos and lectures (although, you'll probably get bored and stop listening).

He's not much fun, but it's an easy A...although he'll try to trick you into thinking his course is hard.",2.0,1.0,Harry Butowsky
,"Very much loves his personality, and loves attention. Talks about him more than the actual class. Does not have much experience, and does not have many examples for the class.

,He makes pre-calculus fun to learn. Hes easy to understand and goes at a slow pace which at times can be annoying if you understood the material the first time around. He also gave me 100% on a hmwk I missed just because I went to his office hours and went over some problems.,5.0,3.0,Brad Justice

No Final.",3.0,2.0,Peter Wejksnora
,"The professor is a nice, fair and great teacher. At times, he gets off subject here and there, but he is always on track.  He knows his subject.

He is very approachable and will help you however you need.,5.0,4.0,Geoff Potvin
,"Valuable course. Imparts much knowledge and wisdom about linux system administration.

WPUNJ should fire her, as she puts the school down in every lecture.",1.0,5.0,Marie Cote

,"I want to be fair as much as I can, but she's a real tough grader she deducts a lot of marks for very simple mistakes, marks were flying out just like money on a shopping spree and she won't help you with any extra credit either. So, don't let your GPA suffer. She is a good teacher though but still Gen chem I doesn't have to be that hard.",2.0,4.0,Marie Cote
,"He's been teaching forever, and is a world class authority on many topics. Just when you start to know enough to think he's ""old fashionned"" he would come up with very modern, ""outside the box"" concepts. He is a walking encyclopedia and an asset to concordia music dept.",4.5,4.0,Andrew Homzy
,"Very good instructor, very knowledgeable. He cracks jokes everyday. He can be a little testy sometimes.",3.5,2.0,Tony Bass
,"Clear explanations and lots of enthusiasm for the content. Notes are not posted online, and not everything in the textbook is used or relevant to the course content. You must attend lectures to do well, but if you do attend you will have no problems getting a good grade in the class.",4.0,2.0,Janet Elliott
,I'm glad I took all my accounting classes with him it was very easy for a pretty challenging material based class. He sometimes gives take home exams but the in class exams are open book/note anyway. I personally did not really pay attention and still got an A,5.0,1.0,Brian Hurley
,"In my case, there were only four grades in his class: 2 papers, midterm, and final. This is what made the class tough. However, Professor Schuster is a great guy and a solid teacher. He keeps the class interesting (as interesting as history can get) and is willing to help those who seem to be struggling. Give him rough drafts of your papers.",4.5,4.0,David Schuster
,"He obviously knows what hes talking about, the lectures were just really hard to pay attention to/boring.

Attendance is not mandatory, but be sure to frequently check what you need to do.",4.0,4.0,Kelly Young
,Mr Mckean provided me with the tools I needed to pursue investigative writing and reporting as well as news writing.  He is fair and balanced .

Additionally his grasp and command of journalism concepts and tools is exceptional.  ,4.0,3.0,Patrick McKean
,"He is very organized, kind, and really wants everyone to understand the material. Stats is a tough subject, but he tries to be clear about what will be on the tests. He also offers opportunities for extra credit. He grades quickly. The workload is reasonable, not much homework, but attendance is important for success because of in class work",4.0,3.0,Joshua Buchanan
,The most difficult part of his course was learning APA format. I enjoyed the group work and chapter assignment. He encourages students to think critically and to get involved with community work. I think he is a great teacher.   He has a particular way of engaging students.,4.5,4.0,Christopher Robinson
,"She pulled a whole weight off my shoulders my first year of college. She is clear from the beginning of what is expected from you. Her feedback is very helpful and teaches clearly.

,"By far one of my favorite professors. She's funny and genuinely cares about her students. There were four papers, including the final essay. She does peer review for every paper, and it is required. There is a group project at the end of the semester, and she bases many of her assignments off of TV/movies. She gives good feedback on all essays.",5.0,4.0,Ebony Gibson

,"Ignore the rating beforehand. Deadlines are all on math lab, why would you ""expect"" extended deadlines? She provides you with power points, my mathlab, and is literally always there to help.

,"Dr. C is not only a wonderful professor, but he's also the best adjuster around!! :-)",5.0,2.0,Stephen Cuono
,Makes math extremely hard. If you want to know how to do the problems you need to rely on the book. He doesnt give extra credit or let you make anything up. He will also grade things very tough and doesnt care how you do on anything. He is also hard to contact at times and will not reply on occasion. Seems like a nice person but not a nice prof.,1.0,5.0,Eric Wiesenauer

,"Honestly this class was unreasonably difficult for a 101 class. It's not that it was hard necessarily, just way too much work expected for such a low level course. Lectures were not good and she just read off the slides for the most part that had nothing to do with the tests. Too much outside work and event attendances required.",2.0,3.0,Kelli Britten
,"So here is the deal with David. He tells you exactly how to get an A during the first day of class. You show up, take notes on the things he repeats, do your blogs and wikis and understand the books enough to write a little on them. This class could not be easier but he leaves the grade up to you.",4.0,2.0,David Allen
,"Devey doesn't seem to be able to apply the educational principals he is teaching. Though i was well prepared, i barely survived the first exam- got an A, but scrambled to understand the questions. When I tried to contact the prof he ignored my emails and discussion board posts, and doesn't hold office hours. This class was a major bummer.",1.0,4.0,Patrick Devey
,Dr. A is literally the best professor I've ever had in my four years as a college student. I've had him for the past 3 semesters for Hebrew 1-3 to satisfy my foreign language credit but I've had him for a normal humanities course as well. He connects with students as if he is their friend and will give you a good grade if you just try your best :),5.0,3.0,Paul Anderson
,"Dr. Brown was an amazing professor. The guy is hilarious and will keep you entertained. The class was 3 hours long, but it went by quick. I took it for only half the semester as well. You have 2 test and they are very easy. Quizzes every class but it's extremely easy. He gives you handouts and there is 1 project. Take him at all cost.",4.0,2.0,Gary Brown
,"KB was awesome. He was very relaxed about attendance, but held you accountable by your work. He was helpful and open to ideas, never made anyone feel that they were wrong for their opinions. He grades according to the college standard guidelines (where a c is a good thing), so I was worried, but I did really well in the class.",5.0,3.0,Kirby Brown
,"Dr. Searfoss is a really great professor who knows her stuff! She does talk very slow so at times it can be difficult to stay engaged. If you have taken phonetics and diction, then this class should be an easy A. The HW she assigns can be a lot but it truly helps you understand the material better. Highly recommend!!",4.0,4.0,Lynn Searfoss

You write three major assignments; poetry, fiction and non-fiction. She wants you to succeed! Would love to take another class with her",5.0,3.0,Melanie Schnell
,"This professor is hard. You need to read tons of readings and articles prior class otherwise you have no idea what is she talking about.

,This class was super interesting and easy if you do the weekly assignments.

It was a lot of reading during the week but he found out we were struggling and broke up the readings so it was easier.,5.0,2.0,Steven Ramey
,"The best professor I've had in the ECE department thus far. Excellent lectures, and if you put effort into this class, it will be rewarded.

,"Amazing professor. Super caring and knows her stuff. I've taken two of her classes so far and both were eye-opening.

,"I liked Dr. K a lot. I am on the edge of an A and a B. He is a hard professor, but his tests are fair and a lot easier than his lectures. If you asks questions he tries to help you to understand. He also does a review at the beginning of every class. Take notes on these because it's a good review for the test! I would take him again.",5.0,4.0,Brian Kliszczewicz
,If the person before me was in the same class theyre wrong. Majority of the class never skipped and many people complained because this professor doesnt explain things well.

,"A remarkable lecturer and person, easy to approach, breaks out into song during lecture & class and makes things fun/interesting. Don't get me wrong you'll work hard, ie: loads of HW, labs & tests are hard. But worth it! especially if you are a bio major. After this class you'll have strong foundational knowledge in all things cell/molec Bio",5.0,4.0,Nathan Staples
,"To be honest I didnt really care for this class cause I dont like anything related to politics, but this professor was very upfront about it and never sugar coated anything like other professors do. Get ready to read those chapters he assigns after every class meeting and study those key terms cause thats really important.",4.0,3.0,Kevin Cameron
,"This class was really easy and I didn't mind having Professor Cornish. The main thing that I didn't like is that she wasn't active with her online students. I never really heard from her throughout the entire semester, just announcements when something would go wrong. It feels like she just forgets about her online students.",4.0,1.0,Disa Cornish
,"She treats the class like elementary schoolers. If anyone says two words, she stops and says ""is my teaching interrupting your conversation?""  Doesn't give a lot of guidelines for the paper.It's just ""Write a critique about whatever you want:a book,a movie,a magazine,a restaurant,a video game, etc."" She is aslo nit-picky about punctuation on papers",1.5,4.0,Karen Depinto

,"Good teacher, teaches the content in a very hands-on way, doing examples with you in class. The main thing I have to fault him on is he's an unnecessarily tough grader. You could demonstrate that you understand the concept by using the correct formulas in the correct ways, but god forbid you miss a negative sign or something because you'll get a 0.",4.0,2.0,Daniel Chase
,If you are not living at home with access to recyclable products this class could become slightly pricey even with trips to the dollar store.

,"Prof. Van Der Poel literally teaches what's in the book, even using the same examples. She's a stickler for notation and exact solving of each question. Every minor error means a point deduction. If you don't understand something she said, she gets annoyed and asks another student to explain. Be ready to pay $100 to turn in homework online.",2.0,4.0,Misako Van Der Poel
,"Excellent course taught by an excellent professor, Steve really knows his stuff and is passionate about teaching.  Follow his instructions and you will do well in class.

,"Aschenbrener was a really good teacher!  I did not always keep up with the assignments.  But I did learn A LOT in her class.  She made it fun and interesting, she really relates herself to the students.  No need to buy a text book which is a bonus!  Only thing I did not like, she picks names out of a cup on popsicle sticks to answer questions.",5.0,2.0,Mollie Aschenbrener
,"Not the easiest class, especially since it was all writing. She was often not very clear on what she wanted you to do, although if you took the time to ask she would try to clarify.

,"So far the kindest professor I've met, ever. Even was able to borrow writing materials off of her in the middle of a term test. Lectures are sort of boring but that's more of the course being inherently boring rather than her as she does try to make it enjoyable. Lots of inconsiderate/noisy kids disrespect her however and I wish they'd shut up tbh.",5.0,3.0,Amy Mullin
,"Nice professor but the class is boring, alot of the stuff is repetitive. Dont really need the book, maybe just for the essay. To get an A you must know her powerpoints very well, better off memorizing them.",4.5,2.0,Simona Montanari

,"Don't be afraid to talk to Dr. Dewald after lecture, and try to sit up front. He will eventually get to recognize you.   A good TA is critical.

Sparknotes is your friend.",4.0,1.0,Jonathan Dewald
,"She is so sweet, like a nice grandma. As long as you do the work you won't have any trouble.

,"Very passionate about what he teaches. However his lectures and his slides were SUPER complicated and lengthy. His slides had way too much information and most of it was not on the exam.

,"Worst teacher/professor I've ever had. She's a scatterbrain who loses work, gives inaccurate grades, plays favorites, and is always in a bad mood.

I literally learned not one thing from taking her English Comp class.",1.0,4.0,Sherri Padgett

,"One of the best professors hands down, makes the class super clear and her enthusiasm she brings to class makes class enjoyable. Take her if you get the chance!",5.0,2.0,Janet Elliott
,"One of the best professors I have had. You do have 1 presentation of 10 minutes but she is by no means a hard grader. The best part is that she tells you exactly what powerpoints to study for the 3 exams you have and better yet the final is a cumulative of the 3 exams, its a given to pass. Also allows for make up work and labs to be done in groups.",5.0,1.0,Sunny Ferrero
,Very nice. Very helpful. Very caring. Really makes class interesting for 7:30 in the morning! :),4.5,2.0,Paul Anderson
,Get ready to work really hard. Midterm test was very lengthy and tricky as it was open book exam. Project was weighted 50%. So you must have good team in order to score good grades. Lectures were interesting and with practical approach. Go for this if you want to learn something and ready to work hard.,4.0,4.0,Nikolaos Tsantalis
,"I took her English 1A class and it was really boring. She's a sweet teacher and really takes her time to explain what needs to be done and how to write. However, it's at a much lower level than what most of the class seems to be at. She isn't a bad teacher, but I wish I had a more challenging teacher.",3.0,1.0,Michelle Blair
,"I took physics 4B in summer, and everyone said it is really a tough class. But, I would say he is the best Physics professor in SJCC. Just study regularly and he asked most of the questions from his lecture slides and quizzes. Although you have to buy webassign for homework, I would say it is really worth it.",5.0,2.0,Dhan Khadka
,"Amy inspired me to pursue a major in Bioethics after taking her class. The material is very interesting and her lecture style is clear, easy to listen to. She is very approachable and understanding, so many students engage in the conversation in her class, she sets up the perfect environment for productive discussion.",5.0,3.0,Amy Mullin

,Yemut gets frustrated when students ask questions... rolls eyes and goes fast when going over the material. He will ask if anyone has questions but expresses irritation if a question is asked and has a strong accent. I used to love math but since i've taken his class i now hate math,2.0,4.0,Emad Yemut
,Professor Michelle Lorimer is a great professor but she has very long and boring lectures. She is genuinely kind and caring to one's needs. There is a lot of reading but it is pretty easy. There are little quizzes that you have to complete but they are very easy. Make sure to take notes during lecture. Study the material before the test.,4.0,4.0,Michelle Lorimer
,"Dr. Neupane was absolutely amazing! I took him for a five week physics course. It was extremely challenging; however, he was always available before and after class for additional help. In addition, he was very fair with grading, and he truly wanted his students to do well in the course! I would take him over and over again!",4.0,5.0,Suman Neupane
,Awesome teacher! I took a lot from this class! Highly reccomend :),5.0,3.0,Jose Soto
,"She an amazing teacher. Very caring and helful. If you need help, ask her;  office hours, email, in class, she really helpful. One time I emailed her at 9:30pm and she responed back with a half hour! I will be taking 102 with her.",5.0,3.0,Margarita Casas
,"This is not a very difficult class and if you show up he will gladly help you. I got A's on all of the tests and hw, if you do not understand the material at first he'll help you learn it. I found the class interesting & even funny sommetimes",4.5,1.0,Rusty Barrett
,"He's a great professor. Not afraid to contradict you in class, so you'd better have tough skin!",4.0,3.0,Lawrence Kraft
,"Professor Allen is knowledgeable and funny. Sometimes his lectures are really boring, but he shows a lot of great movies and books. I think his grading is fair as long as you pay attention in class and read his notes online.",3.0,3.0,David Allen
,"Ms. Carter was professional and consistent with her teaching and helpful qualities. She applied real life examples of her work to the lessons so that we could understand the material  rather than memorizing, which most are use to Students who had issues with her were those who thought they would get good grades and not work for it Class had several",5.0,3.0,Rose Carter
,"BEST GEO LAB TEACHER U CAN GET. very nice, generous guy!",5.0,1.0,Richard Liebling
,Potvin is a great teacher! His class is a modeling class so it is not a normal lecture nor a normal lab. If you're not comfortable with engaging with other students I do not recommend this class for you. He also doesn't give you a straight answer in the middle of discussions so that's a warning. You will constantly be changing who you work with!,4.0,3.0,Geoff Potvin
,"Dr. Stoner was one of the best professors I have ever had. I have had him for two undergraduate courses and two graduate courses and he served on both my undergrad thesis and masters defense committees. He genuinely cares about students learning and producing the best work they can. If you're looking for an A without trying, maybe look elsewhere.",5.0,4.0,James Stoner
,Marketing research is the most difficult class in the marketing track. You should take this class when your fresh out of stats because it will come in handy. The tests are a bear not. Whole lot of people get as on them. Dr Mack comes off very intense but she lightens up toward the end of the semester so don't let her scare you. The book is like reading a dictionary which makes studying for the tests difficult. Overall I learned a lot.,4.0,4.0,Rhonda Mack
,"Grading is based on only a few papers he gives, but he is a very fair grader. I genuinely enjoyed all of his lectures, you will learn from them because he's very interesting. Only down-side is that he is stricter than any professor I've ever had regarding laptop or smartphone use, he is pretty old-fashioned with his view of the classroom.",5.0,3.0,Anthony Solari
,Horrible Instructor. Does not communicate whatsoever. Pretty much getting paid for setting up blackboard & leaves you on you own afterwards.,1.0,5.0,Maria Papapavlou
,"Prepare to do a lot of research if you take this class. This professor did provide feedback on the graded work, but even with the feedback, I was still uncertain why some forums were marked down and others were not. The tests and assignments are very time-consuming and work-intensive.  Overall, it was a difficult and frustrating class.",2.0,4.0,Melissa Kenzig
,She is interesting and entertaining. However she grades very hard. I received a B- on an assignment that I spent so much time and was very concise and well done.,4.0,4.0,Cindy White
,He does not teach. His notes don't explain anything and are written in the format of a horrible textbook. His exams are very hard and require derivations that no one in the class can complete.... which would be fine if they were anything we actually learned. Unorganized and one of the worst professors I've had in CHE,1.0,5.0,Phooi Lim

,"She's very fun, very nice, and very funny. However, sometimes you feel you arn't learning as much as you could.",3.5,1.0,Agnes Conacher
,she hardly helped with any questions I asked over email. Her powerpoint lectures don't really help with the tests because she asks tough detailed questions from it. Her assignments are pretty straight forward but her interaction with students is poor so you have to be good with teaching yourself the material given,1.0,5.0,Rebecca McClay
,This guy gives a lot of tough love in the classroom.   He made the girl next to me cry one day;  but that is his style.  I would go with someone else next time. He is a little too harsh for my taste. ,2.5,3.0,Chris Devenney
,"Very nice guy, but not a good professor. Hard to understand, little information in his lecture slides, and his tests required so much detail over a lot of information, which  made it difficult to succeed. Try to get a different professor if you can.",2.0,4.0,Liang Tang
,"After reading some of Kari's reviews on RMP I was slightly hesitant to take her class, but she was an awesome teacher. She was super caring, took time to explain the concept until we all understood, and made her lectures interactive. I have no complaints from taking her class. She is a solid choice for a math teacher!",4.0,4.0,Kari Rothi

,"Christopher is an amazing teacher, he hardly gives out homework, for the whole semester he only gave 2 essays in which he help you through it the entire time. The only way you can fail is if you don't show up and don't do the little bit of homework he assign. He's very laid back and the most chilling teacher I ever met. I would take him again.",5.0,2.0,Chris Devenney
,Mr. Joe is AWESOME!,5.0,1.0,Joe Micallef
,"Prof Wittman was an excellent teacher.  Attendance isn't mandatory but really helps.  This guy tells great stories and illustrations which helped me learn the med terms.  He really knows his stuff and keeps the long hours from being a snooze fest. Plus, he's really good looking, which helps, too.  Lol",5.0,3.0,Daniel Wittman
,"Mrs. Johnson is very nice and wants her students to succeed.  Notes are printed off of blackboard and the tests are based off of these notes.  The only marginally hard part of the class is typing up the Sociological journal which is due mid-semester.  After the journal is finished, just study your notes and the tests are a breeze.",5.0,2.0,Sandra Johnson
,One of my favorite professors! I didnt learn a ton in this class but everyday was a really good time! Extremely nice man who makes it almost impossible not to get a 4.0,5.0,1.0,Joseph Lee
,"Pretty easy class if you've already taken a lot of science classes like I had. He does a great job of spelling out the entire semester from day one. No need to buy the textbook; everything you need to know for the quiz is on the study guide. Lecture tends to drag, but it's only once a week. I wish he taught more classes. I would take him again.",5.0,3.0,Daniel Wittman

,"Sharon London makes her acting class a lot of fun and everyone in your class will become close with each other.

,"Took paper book and press with her. I loved it. I thought she was supportive, definitely excited by everyone's work, an easy grader. It's also a great syllabus - papermaking + bookmaking. (I learned letterpress with another student.) Awesome to get access to all three studios at once!! Great for self-motivated students",4.0,1.0,Gail Deery
,"This was Dr. Nelson's first year teaching this class. Although he has taught astronomy for several years at Drake & is an amazing teacher, this was most definitely the hardest class I have taken. Teaching styles did not match up to advantage students and made many mistakes that confused the class. He is super accommodating and cares about students",2.0,5.0,Charles Nelson
