0,"She seems like a smart professor but just cant convey her thoughts across. I try so hard to understand but the language barrier is tough. She tries her best to make sure we understand but doesn't really help much, rather confuses more! tests are very ""unique"" as well!",1.5,3.0,Wei Xing
1,"I took 3d Design with him. A genuine guy that loves what he does. Just don't take this class expecting an easy A. His projects make you think analytically and critically, and when it comes time for his infamous critiques, be prepared for criticism. He gives plenty of class time to develop your ideas and is always ready to help if you need him.",5.0,3.0,Benjamin Bellas
1,"I took her for Writing for PR. very sweet, wants students to do well.  very approachable and friendly. class was a lot of work at first. Multiple assignments, and current event and GSP quizzes every class. quizzes were hard so later on she started letting us use the articles. She goes with the flow, but her expectations can be unclear at times.",3.5,4.0,Olga Wilson
1,"Good teacher, she is knowledgeable, professional, approachable  and kind in her words to students. Take her class you will be well prepared for your life's journey. One of the best at Humber College.",4.0,3.0,Shauna Pemberton
1,"Christina is a funny and wonderful person, dont be intimidated by the bad reviews. Christina is very friendly and the classroom environment is relaxed. Due dates for assignments change a lot based on how she thinks how far everyone is. If u r a visual learner it might be harder for u b/c she doesn't show examples of upcoming projects so TAKE NOTES",5.0,4.0,Christina Gregor
1,Very easy and straightforward instructor. You can show up and pass. She has a lot of in class writings but if you miss those she has so much extra credit it is impossible not to pass the class. Textbook online. Weekly journals. EASY Final project. Class was boring though. I just needed the WI credit. Recommend her to anyone needing an easy class.,3.0,1.0,Kathy Backus
1,Class was easy and good introduction class to geography. Her lectures had some interesting things that arent found in the textbook and overall the class was easy and she was very understanding when it came to distant learning.,5.0,2.0,Laura Pangallozzi
0,EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. Rude and unprofessional. If you don't already basically have a masters degree in physics he is going to make you feel stupid. Doesn't care about his students or their comprehension of the material.,1.0,5.0,Phillip Bannow
1,"I think she was my favorite instructor this semester. She provides examples of each dysfluency during lecture, and she makes it VERY interesting. Her first test is probably the most difficult out of all of them, and it isn't even that hard. She definitely wants to see you succeed, and helps you as much as she possibly can!",5.0,1.0,Ericka Olsen
1,"Lazo- Cividanes is a very well informed professor that delight us with his lectures, specially in the Latin American context where I can qualified him as an expert. What I like about him is the way he has help me in the development of my research paper, a paper I have been working since the start of the semester.",5.0,3.0,Jorge Cividanes
1,"Clearly a very intelligent and capable professor, but he expects a lot. 6 week summer course and there were 3 novels and textbook reading, plus 4 discussion assignments, lots of audio lectures, an essay, reading quiz, and 2 writing heavy tests. Really brutal for a lower division course. If you work a lot, this is even more of a struggle.",3.0,4.0,David Sheridan
1,I never write reviews but THIS MAN IS ACTUALLY AN ANGEL. I have never in my life loved a professor as much as Kole Camaj. Hes a gift from God and truly makes me excited for class. I would cut off all my limbs to take this professor again because he is that incredible. He is my favorite professor ive ever had in my life and I would die for this man,5.0,1.0,Kole Camaj
1,"Mr. November gave awesome feedback (but was more vague on the major assignment gradings.) Group workshops were helpful bc you get feedback from other people. HW instructions were sometimes confusing, but for the most part, the class was easy. It's creative writing, so you can't be graded on your art/creativity. Textbook needed, not many e.c..",5.0,2.0,Greg November
1,"Espo is one of my favorite teachers I've ever had, at first he seemed terrifying, but he's truly a funny and nice guy. His class has taught me a lot and we always have meaningful discussions. He's very passionate about what he teaches. Assigns 1 paper a week but they aren't too hard and are usually 1-2 pages. Really improved my writing. ",4.0,3.0,Stephen Esposito
0,This was by far the hardest class I have taken. All of his work is close together. The good thing is he realizes that and works with you on the time frame. Be prepared to STUDY!!! He does not allow enough time for quizzes and exams and they are extremely difficult!,2.5,4.0,Christopher Wayne Purser
0,"I don't like thw fact that he uses a website through a website for the class just stick to one. The subscription for the second website is not free and students must pay for it on their own. I have not struggled to figure out what was going on using the canvas website until this class, every other class was clear and straight forward.",2.0,3.0,Peter Knapp
1,great professor. tests aren't easy but you'll learn a lot from the class,5.0,4.0,Jill Miller
1,"I took his online class and it was great. I recommend listening to his lectures, writing notes, and memorizing pictures...that's all and you should get an easy A/B. I will warn you that his lectures are boring, especially since I have a short attention span, but don't worry..you can always fast forward to the important parts but dont do it too much",5.0,1.0,Alton Jenkins

1,Absolutely brilliant educator. She was very simple to understand.,5.0,5.0,Janice Crowley
0,"Was not very helpful, made me not enjoy sign language as I enjoyed it very much for 1010. She will call people out in front of the class and has a very short temper and extremely inpatient. Not the best teacher for trying to learn a new language, as she expects you to know almost every sign there is.",1.0,4.0,Celia Young
0,This class is so hard. I know its online but you really have to teach yourself EVERYTHING. The weekly homeworks have nothing to do with weekly tests and either have anything to do with the midterms. She curves the midterms. She uses an app called Piazza for extra credit where you can ask your classmates questions,2.0,4.0,Laetitia Placido
1,"Thad is probably the best teacher ive ever had. He makes hard concepts relatable to things in your own life which made bio 21 an extremely beneficial and pleasant experience. Nicest teacher ive ever had, all around just a genuine guy. would definitely recommend this professor!",5.0,5.0,Thad Winzenz

1,"Wonderful to work with. Learning math through Wildman is attainable. He's an excellent teacher with solid communication skills, passionate, and has a natural talent for teaching math. He cares about student success in his class and that helps engage students.I had no math skills prior to taking his classes. Thank you!",5.0,3.0,Peter Wildman

1,"Dr. Zbeida is a very good professor. She is caring and generous in her grading scale. There is alot of reading and writing essays, but then again, this is an English Comp class. It's to be expected. I would definitely recommend this professor. She is funny,lighthearted and accessible outside of class. Very approachable.",5.0,4.0,Jessica Zbeida
1,I love Dr. Nikkel! He is super enthusiastic and has interesting lectures. The homework is an easy two questions per week. He reviews for the tests quite thoroughly so if you go to class on the review day you should be good for the test.,4.5,2.0,David Nikkel
0,she's the worse,1.0,2.0,Roxanne Hamilton
1,He doesn't give you a review for any test or the final. If you ask questions he makes you feel silly for asking them. He uses the old book and not the one the you are told to buy. Even if you take good notes from the book you could be studying something not on the quizzes/test. and still fail them. He is a nice guy and can be funny at times.,3.0,3.0,Bradley McEntire
1,"Mrs Miller is fantastic. You know exactly what is expected of you at any moment in time. Communication on a one to one basis is a bit slower, but she always gets back to you. She shows interest in you as a person too and encouraged us to share weekend or break stories on Blackboard. Really glad I took her class",5.0,1.0,Danielle Miller
1,"Showing up to each & every class is very helpful and he is great at responding to your questions when you are confused whether it is in person or online. ( Especially during quarantine). He is very thorough when it comes to his syllabus, whats going to be expected and what is going to be on the test & exam! So glad I had him as my stats professor!",5.0,4.0,Lane McConnell
0,"Do the homework on time and you can assure that you will pass. I passed this class because of that, and on prior knowledge of physics from high school. I only missed one class and learned almost nothing from him. Tests are nothing like the homework whatsoever. He gets frustrated when students don't understand a concept he thinks is simple.",1.0,4.0,Phillip Bannow
0,This was an easy A class but I didn't learn anything from this professor. I took A&P which is the only reason I knew a lot of the information. Also the directions and the syllabus were very confusing to follow. She would become irritated quickly when asked questions by students. Easy GPA booster.,1.0,1.0,Tara McCormick
1,"I love Quinlan! He's so awesome and fun and his stories really help you understand what he is teaching!

Talk to him about sports, he'll love you.",5.0,3.0,William Quinlan
1,"Dr.Smith is a great. This is one of the easiest classes. No midterm not final. Just write a few papers, submit them. He is very helpful in helping you with your papers, and learning your mistakes, very friendly. Hope to take more classes with him. He's the campus newspaper advisor.",5.0,1.0,Lewis Smith
1,It's once a week and it's a steal in terms of class requirements. You will do great as long as you study/memorize the study guide he gives you at the end of each unit (the week before the exam). Take time for that and you will be absolutely fine.,4.0,2.0,Jonathan Wallace

1,"Excellent prof.  He does NOT pick on people.  Do your work and you have nothing to worry about.  He is easy to talk to and really gets you thinking.  I can honestly say that I learned alot from him.  He's always willing to help and has a great sense of humor.  And yes, he's very hot!",5.0,4.0,Richard Lane
0,"Online Math 90 Class.  Class runs itself.  If you have a question, don't expect an answer until after the assignment in question.  Don't expect your tests graded in a timely manner either, he'll blame the school for not delivering them to him.",2.5,1.0,Steve Narin
1,"Tami is super friendly and helpful! She makes herself easily accessible outside of class to answer or explain any questions we might have. She has lots of long lectures, followed by practice/group work time, so you get lots of hands on. But the homework is definitely a lot of work!",4.0,3.0,Tami Dashley
1,"He's definitely an awesome Professor! He's always ready to help, both in and outside class. His class is super organized and the grading criteria is very clear. Go to class because his lectures are useful. Use homework solutions he printed out to review for exams.",5.0,3.0,Tom Witelski

0,"I had to learn everything from Khan Academy. I have no doubt he might be good in-person but online his videos are 10 minutes for what is supposed to be an hour lecture. He only does ONE problem per section, and his mind seems very scattered. I am not LEARNING from him. I feel like I'm being set up for failure for the future in his online course.",1.0,3.0,Nicholas Eisenberg
1,THANKS,4.5,3.0,Regina Blue-Soloman
1,"He's one of those professors that you resent during the semester because of the amount of reading and how hard his tests are, but I have to say I came away from his class with a ton of knowledge. Makes you work for it, but it's probably the class I've got most out of in college.",4.0,4.0,Daniel Lipson
1,"Professor Thomas-Reid is by far one of my favorite professors. He makes sure to make a safe space for everyone. He is one of the most caring and genuine professors I have ever had.

1,"if you are a science major i highly recommend this prof, you will learn the material if you apply yourself, chemistry is not a class you cheat, you either learn it or not and avila puts you in position to succeed, do all the work requested and you will get a b, slack off and be lazy you won't do well, put the time in and an A is very attainable",5.0,4.0,Ludivina Avila
1,"If youre good at memorizing, take him. His tests are solely based off few things from the horribly boring book he assigns and random things he says in lecture. Pay attention and youll make an easy A. He truly wants you to succeed in life. Hes very awkward at times which is funny. Too bad you have to show up since his class is easy.",3.0,4.0,David Veve
1,"Tough subject with good professor. Moves fast but provides slides,Practice exams VERY similar to exams and lets you make one index card. This class is nothing but a bunch a formulas and knowing how to use them n some excel, He knows his stuff REALLY well, You are getting real knowledge not textbook stuff. Take him but get ready to study n work hard",4.0,4.0,Joel Melendez
1,Lab exercises are given each week as meetings are set for once a week. Online classes were a waste of time as she spent 20 minutes to barely explain and put us into breakout rooms. Constantly bringing us in and out. Talks a lot about other things and will speed through topics. Will probably yell and be energetic. Teacher is okay and understanding.,3.0,3.0,Erica Sharar

1,"Obviously those who don't want to do the work will give the worst reviews. Those who say she has an accent are plain ridiculous. She is very organized, gives wonderful lectures and has emailed back in a few minutes. So not sure what the complaints are about! Tough class, so do your WORK!!!!! She made an online class WORK! Great prof.",4.0,4.0,Roopa Prasad
0,"She makes this class really hard, but if you ask for help outside of class it will help. She moves too quickly through material, her accent makes her hard to understand, and she doesn't answer questions in class well. There are graded clicker questions each class. There is a semester long group project. Definitely suggest going to office hours.",2.0,4.0,Trista Wang
1,The professor is basically a live textbook (in a good way). If you don't like watching someone solve math problems though you can just read the textbook. Only part that really sucked was the TA. He's super harsh and mis-graded my homework several times.,5.0,3.0,Arie Israel
0,"Do not take Mr. Weiner's class. Do not. He doesn't answer questions, there are a lot of assignments. He is stubborn in his opinion. He can be very rude. The class is like a high-level sociology class instead of an intro class. There is so much reading and if you don't understand it he patronizes you. Just find some other professor, please.",1.0,4.0,David Weiner
1,"TAKE HIS CLASS! He is so cool. He will make the class fun. Gives review questions based on the book chapters and the same exact ones are on the exams. Exams are super easy! He does make you do essays but make sure you follow his directions on them. Not hard, if anything they are super easy because provides enough information in class to write essay",5.0,1.0,Joe Alvarez

0,"I really wanted to enjoy this class because of the subject, but Professor Sewell makes it hard to. I've taken more academically rigorous classes, yet this professor has the harshest standards of grading I've witnessed so far. She does give instructions, but even when you try to adhere to her standards, it's not good enough. Regret signing up.",2.0,4.0,Lauren Sewell
1,"Prof Infante is such a nice and genuinely caring person. Despite the fact that I never understood a single reading and could probably, at the end of the semester, not tell you what this class is about I would take the course again in a heartbeat. It is rare you find a professor as nice and class discussion was always fun even when it was confusing!",5.0,2.0,Ignacio Infante
1,"Michael Elliot is an awesome professor. Not only does he nail down on information that you need, but he also has plenty of useful advice to go with it.

1,"The class is mostly lectures, but she does a good job keeping it interesting. It is fast-paced and difficult to keep up with sometimes. There are 4 exams, 4 books, and a few other assignments.

0,"He likes to have a lot of classroom participation and is very energetic, but does it in a wrong way. Tries to take feedback from students but lots of times gets lost in what the feedback actually is.

0,Horrible class structure and the professor is a bit crazy. I dropped this class because I had a bad feeling about him.

0,"The class consists of heavy reading work, weekly reflections, and an overarching group project that is based on the idea of creating a well rounded lesson plan.

Still got an A but it was not a pleasant time.",1.0,4.0,Alina Reznitskaya

1,"ONLINE CIT 120. He was helpful & organized. This online class was VERY easy to understand. I would totally recommend him. Also, my BF took him too & my BF emailed him asking if he would still get a ?B? in the class if he didn?t do the last project & Mr. S said that he would SPOT HIM 5.5 points so he?d get an ?A? if he did the project. AMAZING.",5.0,1.0,Robert Scherbaum

After the draft, the class is a breeze.",4.5,4.0,Burke Miller
0,"Class is very unorganized to the point where self-researching the quiz/test topics is where I actually learned anything.

Lectures skip around and make no cohesive sense.",2.0,4.0,Matt Peisen
1,"This was an online class and each week, there were anywhere from 2 hours to upwards of 3-4 hours of lectures you had to watch. This is added on top of the weekly lab assignment you have to do.

0,DO NOT TAKE EZELL. May be the worst professor I have ever had. Is extremely rude and gives a ton of pop quizzes.

Only way to pass is if you tune everything out to hear him clearly since he mumbles & he could explain an essay prompt w/o you realizing it. Only assigns 400 word paper vs the 1,000 criteria. Learned nothing since he genuinely does not teach.",2.5,3.0,Ray Butman

He will tell you ""get out of my face"".  extremely rude.",4.0,5.0,Rick Brown

1,"Great teacher! I had him as my micro professor for my 1st term as a freshman. He made the course very durable and easy to understand.

He's a very decent guy who is good to have on your side.",4.0,4.0,Ken Kam

His lectures are engaging and beneficial for anyone going into counseling. I also had him for CSG421. Both classes were taught the same way. He is also flexible on deadlines and over-skipping.,4.0,1.0,James Meyers
1,Fannie is a fairly new lecturer but she was very good. She was speaking clearly and adjusting quickly to the students' needs. She was receptive and helpful.,4.0,3.0,Fannie Carrier Emond
1,"She was very helpful throughout the semester. As long as you do the reading and homework, you will be set for the oral quizzes. The in class essays come right from notes taken in class a few days prior. The best professor I have had at Shepherd",5.0,2.0,Stephanie Slocum-Schaffer
1,"Best professor in the English department. He obviously cares about his students and made the course fun, interesting, and important. I would argue this class was the most informative American Lit course I have ever taken. His hair is fantastic and he's hilarious. Take him if you can!!",5.0,3.0,Ian Green
1,Tough grader. Sometimes his grading doesn't make sense but he give ample opportunity to revise assignments. If you put in the effort and he can clearly see you're trying your best he'll help you out a lot. I also did 207 which wasn't listed in the dropdown menu.,4.0,4.0,Trevor Kearns
1,"A true gem, she definitely cares about her students and their success. She makes learning fun, but GET READY TO READ!!!!!!!!!!!",5.0,4.0,Susan Mudrick-Smiley
1,"(part 3) Cons(4): There are three exams in total and each counts 33% of the final grade, participation and the lab part of the course is of no value in terms of counting towards the final grade.  Cons (5): He gives more than 100 mutiple choice questions on the exam so it is guaranteed for you to get at least 7-10 questions wrong on the exam.",3.5,3.0,Jon Sperling
1,A pretty laid back guy who genuinely loves what he teaches. We had very specific reviews for the 3 tests we had so that made the tests a lot easier. i studied probably an hour for each and had a b+ on all of them so just a little effort goes far. Can get a bit boring though because he mainly just lectures the whole class but i still recommend him.,4.0,2.0,Brian Williams
1,"2 discussions and 2 responses a week which was pretty normal. Quizzes are fairly easy if you've read the material. 20 multiple choice, 5 short paragraph response. He responds pretty quickly to e-mails, gives good feedback and grades fairly!",5.0,3.0,Jerry Lulejian
1,"Best science teacher I have ever had, period! I have 207 accredited hours so far, and she wins hands down. I recommend her all the way. Wish there were more like her. If you have a chance to take her and you don't, that's a mistake on your part.",5.0,2.0,Dolores Smith
0,"Professor Walter is a nice guy. It is just a very boring class. All he does each class is read word-for-word off his power points. Definitely take him if you want an easy A but if you are actually interested in this subject, do not take him!",2.0,1.0,Bruce Walter
1,"Matt is amazing. He teaches all of the labs for the intro stats class, and it's obvious that he puts all that he can into making the class as understandable as possible. He loves helping people one-on-one through a problem and is very approachable. Honestly the best part of this class is the lab because he teaches it!",5.0,2.0,Matt Anderson
1,"Dr. Avila really cared about the students. She made sure everyone knew the content. AMAZING professor, I understood everything she was teaching clearly. As long as you turn everything in, youll for sure get a B and getting an A Is also easy. Shes also very funny and sarcastic, you can tell she loves what she does! Great prof!",5.0,2.0,Ludivina Avila
1,"For such a lame topic, she explains concepts in detail and welcomes questions. You get a chill/helpful ""Mom Vibe"" while she lectures.",4.0,4.0,Susan Cashin
0,Kelm really doesn't care if you pass or not all of his lectures are done through online videos and he does not teach in class. He simply goes over questions that students have. He assigns a ton of homework so I recommend only taking him if this class is your main focus.,2.0,5.0,Travis Kelm
0,"Poorly organized, graded by few things for a semester long grade. Very book heavy. Most students are confused with what is going on in this class so everyone just does their best. Other profs are worse so just take this for your gen ed and get through it. Cool, funny guy but isn't the best teacher. I could see him being a good upper division prof",2.0,3.0,Norman Sullivan
1,Professor MJ was by far one of the best professors I have ever had and hands down the most inspirational person Ive ever came into contact with! She takes the fear out of public speaking and does it In a very fun and creative way. I absolutely loved this professor.,5.0,2.0,Melinda Mingo
1,"She is an amazing instructor. You can never be bored in class because she lectures in a way that grabs your attention. She also does group discussions a lot which was a great way to get the students engaged. Assignments are only responses of guest lectures we see and the occasional extra readings assigned. I had the textbook, but didn't need/use it",5.0,2.0,Natalie Cox
1,"Great Teacher , extremly helpful, orgainzed and harmonous. You pay tuition to learn from somone not to read it out of a book and he does just that.",5.0,3.0,Mike Crittenden
1,"Dr. Green is an extremely caring guy. He is always accessible during office hours and willing to help. He makes everybody feel as if they matter in the class. You have to participate and you have to do your work, you work for your grade but it is well earned! He has a New Yorker accent and is humorous, plus, admiring to look at.",5.0,4.0,Ian Green
1,Dr.Z has a thick accent but you will adjust to it quickly. She makes the lectures bearable with jokes and commentary. She writes down all the notes on the slides so it's easy to understand and take notes and she is willing to help any student that comes to her. She's very knowledgeable about the subject and her passion for anatomy comes through.,5.0,5.0,Natalya Zinkevich
1,"She is such a sweet professor! She pretty much wouldn't hurt a fly! Class is only mandatory for clicker questions, other than that you will pretty much teach yourself from the book and online tests. good class.",4.0,1.0,Melissa Birkett
0,"Words cannot describe how terrible this class was, take Mrs. Pickham if you want to have a chance at passing speech.  And if you do for some reason take this class, be ready to hate your life, dont come in 1 minute late, dont fidget while giving your speech and make sure to let her know i hate her guts, thanks.",1.0,5.0,Jennifer M. O'Donnell
1,"Prof McMillen is the best COB 300 teacher in my opinion. Idk why but I want to do well in his class to impress him. DO NOT SLEEP ON THE TESTS, they're pretty hard. But, he tells you what to focus on and the best way to study and it works. Great experience for my only marketing class",4.0,3.0,Robert McMillen
1,One of my favorite teachers at Southern Miss. He gives great lectures and almost everything you need to know is from the lecture. In order to receive an A in the class he says that you have to read. He is very informative and his tests are not too hard since he puts up every study guide by the first day of class.,5.0,3.0,Daniel Capper
1, GET BOOK ONLINE.  Many assignments.,5.0,1.0,David Marlow
0,"Lectures are dry and quite boring honestly. As a required class, you'll have to deal with it. Maybe just don't take it as an 8am class and the lectures would be more enjoyable. He seems like a genuinely good and funny guy. I just don't enjoy his lectures.",2.0,3.0,Gary May
1,"Tough class, but he will give you points for anything, so show your work. Great guy and awesome class. If you think the material is boring, it will make it hard to listen and do well.",5.0,4.0,Timothy Flannery
1,Professor Platz is a good professor. She gives a clear criteria on what is wanted and is pretty lenient on most occasions. If you need a writing course to be fullfilled take it with Jenny Platz,5.0,1.0,Jenny Platz
1,Nice professor. Not really interested in the course but he did a good job teaching it. Exams come more from movie sheets than lectures. if you memorize movie sheets and read powerpoints you should do fine.,4.5,3.0,Orin Gelderloos
1,"Miller is the most amazing and genuine professor that I have ever had. He really cares for his students and just wants to interact with everyone. If you need an English class, definitely take him. You won't regret it!!!!",5.0,1.0,Stephen Miller

1,He is great teacher but you'll struggle a lot if you haven't taken a piano class highly recommend to take a piano class before this one. Also make a lot of appointments with him if you don't understand something like the values of the notes. Even if its one thing. This class was hard for me since I was in a guitar class before not piano.,4.0,4.0,Peter Knapp
1,Such an easy class! Everything is laid out for you and she gives clear study guides. Easy A and lots of extra credit opportunities. not extremely interesting content and a lot of common sense information but otherwise a great class. No need for the textbook.,4.0,1.0,Tara Stringer Guerriero
1,"Beyond some very dry humor, Professor Davis is great in providing valuable feedback and keeping lectures very straightforward. Exams are based on practice problems, not looking to trick students. Group Projects are assigned throughout the semester. A paper as a final project giving you the freedom to pick your favorite topic.",5.0,3.0,Darwin Davis
0,"Ugh, biochem is hard but there are other professors you can and should take than him. I understand that teaching through zoom is not his thing, but he rushes through his lectures very often. This class is only based on your exam grades and that is something you should look out for. Fail one exam, and you're out from the race of getting an A.",2.0,4.0,David Hoffman
0,Her Teaching ability is very pathetic,1.0,5.0,Darlene Pabis
1,"Morra is extremely passionate about his field and is very enjoyable to have as a teacher. His lectures are clear, detailed and easy to understand.

1,"Took her for chem111 and she is mu favorite chem professor out of the 3 I've taken. Yes it's a tough class but she is easy to approach and explains things better if you ask her too. I would take her again, assuming I pass the class",5.0,2.0,Samantha Katner
1,Hands down the best math teacher I've ever had. I feared Math until I had Alisa's class. she explains things in a way that makes it easy for non math folks to understand. Her tests are hard but she prepares you for them really well. I would recommend her to anyone!,5.0,3.0,Alisa Vanorden
1,"I love Dr. Hartman she is so caring, and helpful. As long as you put forth effort she will help you with whatever you need help with. She is so understanding, and easy to talk to. She likes to talk to her students and check in with her students to make sure they are understanding the assignments and are doing a good job. Very easy.",5.0,1.0,Kathleen Hartman
0,"I withdrew from Ms. Lytle's class because she was very difficult to contact, seemed picky, and assigned a speech outline the first week without giving us any information or examples about how to do it. Perhaps she would be better in person.",2.0,4.0,Erika Lytle

1,"This class is hard, but its a two-in-one gen-ed knockout, and the content is very stimulating. Unlike most classes, you have to actually participate to pass. Sections are easy and offer extra credit every week. Very funny dude. Not much more I can say.",5.0,3.0,Leslie Looney
0,"He gives the worst grades ever. He lectured on A thing and mark you down for doing literally the exact same thing. He's good I give him that but doesn't allow him to be rude when giving comments. His instructions are unclear and his requirements are just too much. He's asking for too many things, even if you're doing everything asynchronously.",1.0,5.0,Michael Dowding
1,Dr hauck was very clear in lecture and encouraged interactions outside of class in group sessions (even on Sunday afternoons). An A is very very possibly with Dr Hauck if you review notes outside of class before quizzes and exams.,5.0,4.0,Nathanael Hauck
1,Prof. Jackson makes public speaking bearable! Her classes seem like a large family so you are encouraged to speak. She has five speeches but gives amazing feedback for you to improve on each time.

1,After taking Professor Perez for speech class i'm no longer scared to be in front of a class and present. She's a great teacher that gives great feedback that will strengthen your speeches.

1,"Great guy.  He makes you work, but you learn a lot.",5.0,4.0,Scott Fredrickson
1,"Not a bad professor.  Like the rater before said, it's just hard sitting through 2 1/2 hours of lecture at night.  Basically an easy A if you go to class and do the papers.  He is full of a lot of information though.  He knows his stuff and has a lot of real life experiences.",4.0,1.0,Mikhail Grachev
1,Really helpful...lots of extra credit and study sessions. Fair...patient...helpful.,4.5,3.0,Bob Odien
1,"He literally gives you every answer to the tests. Grading is just 6 tests and go to 2 orchestra concerts. He's very... eccentric. Talks about political issues a lot, which I think is more interesting than music anyway. I recommend him. Do not get the book, it's a waste. Just buy the online access code.",4.5,1.0,Reimund Koehler
1,"Always show up to classes. There are regular assignments. She offers a lot of reading, but it's all articles. So no textbooks needed. She really makes it clear she wants to be there. Health econ can be a bit dry, but she incorporates a lot of relevant stuff for today. It was a great class",5.0,4.0,Jacki Strenio
1,"friendly and tries hard to entertain the class with pictures, but his notes are very disorganized and doesn't tell you which parts of his version arent in the 'student' version so unless you print them, try to sit with someone who does; relatively easy, nice to have all multiple choice with bonus questions and not cumulative",3.0,3.0,Edward Lai
