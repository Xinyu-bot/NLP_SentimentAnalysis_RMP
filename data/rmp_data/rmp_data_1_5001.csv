0,AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  Ms. Bridges was one of the least effective teachers that I have ever had.  She often times makes problems way more confusing than they really are because she doesn't understand the material.  Those who did well in the class had previously taken calculus.  Her tests are really tough unless you understand all the concepts.,1.5,5.0,Faith Bridges
1,I had to retake this class and this professor made it very easy for the class to pass because he provides sample exams that are just like the exams. I regret not taking him the first time I took this class. He is better than any other.,4.0,2.0,Nikolas Kidonakis
1,"The biggest problem is that Dr. Dewald expects an enormous amount of reading and effort for a gened class. Some people say you can don't need to read but you really do. On his tests you have to correctly identify quotes and write an essay. The first two test are easy, but the final you actually need to read to do well. DO NOT TAKE IF YOU CAN CHOOSE",3.0,4.0,Jonathan Dewald
1,"I took her online class this past semester. Lots of forum posts in the online class, but helps you understand the short stories and poems. The class greatly improved my writing.",4.0,3.0,Melanie Schnell
1,"Ok boys and girls, welcome to college. Shapero's ENF and 111 classes are decent; however, her 112 class is tough. A lot of reading and writing. She's very loving and caring even though it may not seem at times. Shapero is about good writing,""period."" No easy A's. I worked my butt off for an A. She's not big on due dates, and doesn't use book.",4.5,3.0,Sylvie Shapero
0,"So I liked the course content even though there'too much reading. Good news! Pop quizzes aren't hard at all. Professor A looked unapproachable and she was sometimes harsh with students. I don't recommend this class, the content was great! but the vibe was just not right.",1.0,3.0,Andrea Tone
1,I took anthropology 100 fall quarter. The class was a bit long but it also wasn't everyday. I believe the time spanned over 2 hrs. He is a very interesting guy who always seems to be happy and excited to teach. Material was very interesting but like I said it was hard to continuously pay attention because the class was so long not because of him.,5.0,1.0,David Holliway
1,"I love the way Ms. Sexton teaches! I wish I could have her for every class that I take.  She is very understanding that you have a life, and that things happen.  She's also very inspirational and cares about you as more than just another student! Love, love, love her!",5.0,2.0,Treva Sexton
0,"Stay away from this class!!! He expects you to be a genius and teaches the class like we're PhD students. Like bro, how do you expect me to prove all of calculus in a one hour test?!?!?",1.0,5.0,Blake Temple
1,DIFFICULT class but great professor!!! Really cares about students and always willing to stay late to help u understand material.,5.0,4.0,Laura Gershuni
1,The class is very easy if you buy the textbook and follow the powerpoints. She does a good job explaining the material but kids don't pay attention because she is kinda boring. But she gives a lot of extra credit on each test - a 70% or higher was a A. If you put in a little effort and pay attention you will do fine,3.0,2.0,Carolin Schellhorn
1,"Great professor! Super nice, intelligent, & sexy! Quizzes are easy, projects are straight forward, and simulations were fun. I love to hear him lecture.",5.0,1.0,Richard Tapia
1,"Professor Fazelpour loves to be redundant about the less-important stuff. He will also tell you to write down notes that you already have. He does not use BlackBoard and does not, from my experience, respond to emails. The class is easy and important but I feel he could teach much more effectively.",3.0,2.0,Alireza Fazelpour
0,"Do yourself a favor: don't take this class. If you need honors credit, take psychology. He is so bad that he told us that ratemyprofessor is full of students that failed the class and are illiterate. I obviously didn't fail and he was bad enough that I needed to let anyone that is considering his class know that they need to reconsider.",1.0,5.0,Lee Maril

1,"Dr. Xing was so helpful and patient in teaching us in Orgo 2. When everything had to be quickly switched to online, she did an amazing job.

1,"Professor Lowi is an amazing professor. She really cares about her students and is very interested in their opinions. She is very learned about the Middle East and this is what makes her class so interesting. However, she assigns a LOT of readings and is a VERY hard grader.",3.5,4.0,Miriam Lowi
0,She gives an unnecessary amount of homework and takes forever to grade it. I always dreaded going to her class but she did cancel quite often.,2.0,2.0,Melissa Murata
0,"There's no structure to her class. Classes are like coffee shop, feminist book discussions. There's nothing probing your thoughts. It really just feels like I was part of a big book club. If that's your thing go for it.",2.0,2.0,Kristy Odelius
1,"She's a great professor. Grade relies heavily on participation in class. Some online reading modules required, but you have all semester to do them. One individual essay, one group project that takes up a good portion of the semester, and a group essay for that project. She gives individual grades so don't worry if your partner isn't great.",4.0,3.0,Lisa Michals
1,"Great Professor! I took her for the Summer Pre-calc term Online and it was so easy. Hw, quizzes, and tests are all done on MyMathLab. She lets you use one notecard on the Midterm, and two notecards on the Final which is really helpful because you can jot down notes/formulas. Responds to emails really quickly and is there for you if you need her.",5.0,2.0,Wendy E. Bush
1,"Mr. Carson is hands down a great professor. He genuinely cares about his students and their well-beings. There are a couple of group projects and papers to write, but nothing too major. All grades are averaged together, nothing is weighted. I've taken him for ENGL 1101 and 1102 and I wish I could take him again.",5.0,2.0,Alfred Carson
0,Lots of readings. One of the worst professors I've had at AU. While the readings are interesting there is no deep discussion and you don't get helpful feedback. ,1.5,5.0,Jocelyn McCarthy
1,"Professor Brown is one of my favorite teachers I have had at U of O. He was helpful, engaged in class discussion, encouraged creative thinking, exposed us to a variety of ideas and opinions, and somehow made our class feel like a giant family at the end of ten weeks. He was amazing, I would recommend him to anyone who wants to grow as a person.",5.0,3.0,Kirby Brown

0,"I took Mr. Camp for EH 101 and 102 and I dont recomend him for either. He isnt very clear on what hes grading for and he didnt give any feedback.

1,"Hardest class I've taken so far, but the professor is straight to the point. If you even LOOK lost she will do anything to help you understand the material. Her lectures are highly important in order for you to pass the course so DO NOT miss class. Everything she lectures is on the tests!",4.5,4.0,Miriam Keller-Perkins
1,"Mi-sook expects alot from her students.  She will push you, but she always helped me when I needed it and helped me to refine my craftsmanship.  She can be a little harsh in critiques, but hey, it's a tough world.  The only complaint I have is that she makes students write in critiques.",5.0,5.0,Mi Sook Hur

0,She is a director and not very knowledgeable about acting and movement. She plays videos from a website and tells students to copy the moves. The vocal warm-ups are also copied from papers. Basically she doesn't have the necessary education and experience. Don't take her classes.,1.0,3.0,Stefanie Sertich
1,Very caring and understanding professor reviews multiple times one main topics. make sure you don't miss too many classes that's the only thing that will fail you other than that great professor would definitely reccomend.,5.0,3.0,Hector Velarde

1,"He is a beautiful creature and incredibly nice! He's very clear with his explanation and encourages everyone to engage with each other hence why it's a Marketing course. I just didn't like how we needed to group ourselves the 2nd class because we hardly knew anyone but it is a good way of exercising networking skills. Also, doesn't post his notes.",4.0,2.0,Raymond Lavoie
1,"He is an alright teacher.  His talks can be boring, but he breaks it up with interesting videos or real world things he notices.  He def knows his econ. He's also flexible and understanding.",3.5,2.0,Tim Schilling

1,Shes one of the nicest teachers here and is very flexible. Love her,4.0,3.0,Lakesha Moore
1,I learned a lot about art and myself taking this class.  Mi-Sook is a nice person and knows her stuff.  She pushes you to do your best which sometimes stresses you out.  She's honest and tells you if your project sucks.  Expect to spend time and money on every project.  BE PREPARED TO MISS SLEEP WHILE TAKING THIS CLASS. Take if dedicated to art.,3.5,3.0,Mi Sook Hur
1,"Dr. Ptak does a great job at getting you to think about the lesson in new and interesting ways - and he's a great, approachable, and caring person too. Class was fun and engaging, and I really learned to think more carefully and analytically about my thought process. That said, I wish the class was more organized and that he graded faster.",5.0,1.0,Corey Ptak
1,"Melanie was an amazing prof for English 100. There were lots of readings and forum posts in the course and four essays. It was not lecture heavy.

1,"He gives quizzes every week worth only 1% of your mark that let you know your weak areas. If you spend time only studying the material for the quizzes where you didn't score 100%, you'll ace this class. He doesn't care about attendanceparticipation.",3.5,2.0,Mark Buchner
1,I LOVE this man. I go to his office (he's also my advisor) just to talk to him and end up spending way too long there. Not only is he helpful but he also is such a fascinating lecturer. He can show you the other side of any issue. Highly recommended!,5.0,3.0,Rick Werner

1,"Mr. Stagg is by far one of the toughest professors I've had. He gives a lot of papers, homework, and groupwork. On the plus side, he certainly helped improve my writing skills and knowledge of citations (so. many. citations.) As for his personality, he's a but rude and loud.",3.0,5.0,Kevin Stagg

0,"This man is the worst professor I have ever encountered. Disorganized, wild tangents about Nazis and Eugenics, and ""jokes"" that would probably get a student a one-on-one meeting with the dean. Stay as far away from this guy as you can. Tests and finals used to be easy, but he had instructions from admin to change them, now they're super difficult.",1.0,5.0,Stephen O'Leary
1,nice guy but his stroies go off track and get out of hand while he is teaching.Some stories do not even seem so true.Supposeldy he has been to college everyhwere.He is a married man with a young daughter but always comments about beautiful women he has seen.I just think thats a bit strange-runs slow on notes bc stories way too long.,3.0,3.0,Wade Watkins
1,"Lectures/discussions are mandatory, attendance will be taken. Exams are easy as she gives a complete study guide with all of the material on it, just memorize.

1,"Really, really cool dude. Super chill and makes class fun. The work throughout the class I thought was a complete waste. Didn't take anything away from the course, but that had to do with the course, not Eddie. He was an awesome professor and made this class semi-bearable.",5.0,1.0,Eddie Paje

1,Gilbert is a clear professor. Delivers material in concise and coherent fashion. Weekly quizs were somewhat difficult in my experience. Written portion easy multiple choice not so. Help in class not so out of class. Difficult to get certain info from him. Only answers course questions. Not sympathetic to mental health needs. Good reading material.,3.0,4.0,Michael Gilbert
1,"Dr. McConkey is a darling. Keeps things clear and interesting, keeps things balanced between student participation and lecture, and clarifies difficult concepts.

1,He is my favorite prof at CSUSM so far! He is so smart and is really passionate about what he teaches!

1,"For me I think I didn't enjoy this class only because of his teaching style. I attended every class, but it still didn't help. A lot of what you learn is based on the homework which is hard to learn from because it's all online on Wiley.

She’s a great person just not that good of a teacher.  :  (,3.0,4.0,Kristin Fletcher

0,She gives you a quiz over the chapter before you even go over it in class. This class is very hard and she tells you from the very beginning that if you don't study 20hrs. a week you wont pass. She is a fast reader and if  you don't get the notes down she doesn't really care. If this is your first Science class to take DO NOT TAKE HER! ,1.5,5.0,Stephanie Zitrick
1,"Personally, I really liked the class. However, is pure memorization and alot of it. He is a good teacher, very approachable and easy to contact if you need to.

1,"Great professor, straight and to the point. Takes multiple teaching approaches both individual and group work, which is nice. The class can be fast paced for those who struggle with spanish, but overall she is a good professor and lets you know when she sees you're working hard.",4.0,4.0,Gloria Canale
1,Expects way too much out of her students. Mainly goes off the textbook which can be difficult because there is so much information. Study guides are useless because they are so broad. Tests are not passible unless you study the book inside and out.,3.0,4.0,Angela Currier
0,Is awful with technology especially computers! He tells you what will be on the exams but is not really on them. And DO NOT EMAIL HIM! he is a nice guy but shouldn't be able to handle a classroom and make sure he gives you the right office hours,2.5,3.0,Robert Vaillancourt
0,"EXTREMELY HARD GRADER. Considering your grade is dependant on passing exams, it is a very precarious position to be in. Lectures are monotonous and boring, the lack of engagement makes it difficult to determine what is expected of you and what you are expected to know and gain from the class. Would honestly recommend any other prof in the dept.",1.0,5.0,Stephen Connor
1,"She is a very nice lady, always in a good mood and knows every students name, but she makes the material but more complicated than it needs to be.

0,"He's a nice guy and knows his stuff; however, not cut out for teaching. Another teacher (head of dept maybe?) sets what he teaches and I feel this is a downfall for him. Teacher needs to use his own lessons to teach the required information. If you actually want to learn something, take a different class. Looking for just a grade? Take his class.",2.5,3.0,Joseph Lee
1,"Professor Taylor is very knowledgable and it is obvious he enjoys teaching. He is easily accessible outside of class and willing to help. Midterms and exams were fair, as is his grading.

1,"I loved Professor Roberts. She was tough but I was always engaged in her class. I learned a lot and also think I was able to improve my writing skills. Papers are tough, would recommend utilizing the GSIs who are amazing. Exams are blue books with a study guide of potential terms and prompts, and relatively easy. Tough but worth it.",5.0,4.0,Elizabeth Roberts
0,He is a very tough grader and attendance is mandatory. Arriving a minute or two after class begins gives you an entire absence. His tests are easy if you study. If you are taking this class because you like Shakespeare be prepared to take in a lot of visual performances and analysis not only reading. You read about a play per 2 class periods.,2.0,4.0,Bradley Ryner

1,"I truly enjoyed having Zheng as a professor as a person. However, I found her grading to be extremely unregulated and critiques weren't given until after the next project was due.

0,"Extremely easy, learn nothing. Easiest A I've ever gotten.",1.0,1.0,Julie Albertson
1,"Readings are interesting! Be prepared with questions and comments, so you can contribute to discussions, as participation is significant part of grade. Most of your learning will happen there, rather than through Prof. Tone. She's very strict about deadlines. Course had potential to be amazing, but Prof. Tone was not very present nor compassionate.",2.5,4.0,Andrea Tone
0,"She is a nice person but I found her ineffective as a prof. Very confusing, as she seems to go in circles with her explanations and will never give you a straight forward answer. I highly recommend the textbook as that is the only way I learnt anything, I taught myself the entire lecture. She was defensive when I voiced my confusion. Unapproachable",1.0,4.0,Barbara Sander

1,"Newhouse really cares about people's opinions. He will listen to you and appreciate everyone's perspective.

Sometimes his expectations are not 100% clear on assignments. His discussions in class are great.",3.0,3.0,David Newhouse
0,Very very hard class. Professor Alse seems like a really smart guy but is not a very good teacher at all. His in class lectures are just all over the place and are really hard to follow I had an easier time understanding the material by reading the book.  His tests are extremely difficult be prepared to study all day and all night before the test.,2.5,5.0,Johnny Alse
1,Professor Fan is an amazing professor! She repeats herself a lot but it's to make sure that you understand what she's teaching and it's LIKELY that the things she repeats are going to be on the exams. HW is easy. She offers study guides so do them! Offers 4% of extra credit. Not a tough grader when it comes to the case study.,5.0,2.0,Qin Fan
1,I enjoyed my class with Dr. Currier. She's clearly passionate about micro and enjoys teaching. She broke up lecture by having small group questions (not projects or anything) to help review. Definitely recommend the e-book and using the quizzes in it to study. She gives you extra credit for doing them as well. Tests are pretty difficult.,4.0,4.0,Angela Currier

0,"Robert Ruder is the worst professor I have taken at Gonzaga. His classes are so boring! Sometimes he'll lecture on and on without making a real connection to what we are learning in the class. Also, this is a class on business information systems, but you don't even learn how to create one! He doesn't even teach, he assigns readings and that's it.",1.5,3.0,Robert Ruder

0,"Extremely rude (condescending) to students. I've had plenty of bad teachers, but her level of disrespect is far above any other. She reads off slides created by a TA & HW that is way beyond the scope of the course. Exams are long and confusing. Only thing she cares about are her stories (football talk) during the 1st 30mins. Don't take if possible.",1.0,5.0,Kathleen Rankin

1,"Class was so great, I am actually taking him again for 1302.  Being present for the class is key, he prefers to tell the information as a story.

Highly recommend.",5.0,4.0,Adam Gerritsen
1,"Although she may not always be clear when it comes to how she wants things, she's helpful and super sweet. As long as you attend class and she sees you're putting in effort, she'll definitely help you. The textbook (pdf) can be found online but the AP stylebook is a must. You'll use it in other classes too. She's the advisor of BB too by the way.",5.0,3.0,Kathy Jesse

Uses quizzes and tests combined with a group union negotiation presentation.  5 stars for Professor Kipp.",5.0,1.0,Steven Kipp
1,He was good. He would sometimes let us out early or ask us if we wanted to stay and do class or not. He test grading is like u compete w/ ur classmates and ur test score is based against everyone's else. I got a 69 on my first test and it was a B.,3.5,3.0,Richard Dale Oriol

1,"Don't take her if you are lazy. She isn't going to spoon feed you, or give easy A's but definitely prepares you for tougher courses. Studying every day and working on the problems is a MUST.

0,"The material itself is fun and I learned a lot from it. Theres no denying hes knowledgable and creative.

If not, youll probably enjoy the class and do fine",1.0,4.0,Bret Keeling
1,"Kelly is the best. She is very chill and we play a lot of games. Kickboxing is a hard workout but worth it. Also, she lets you miss a good amount of classes and still gives you a good grade. It is a very fun class and I recommend taking it.",5.0,1.0,Kellie Claverie
1,"This professor should have a higher rating. What more could you want? There's 4easy quizzes, one easy essay (it can be as short or as long as you want it to be but he said three pages is good) and he picked the textbook because it's affordable. Attendance is also optional. He takes late work and late quizzes for no grade penalty. Great class Easy A",5.0,1.0,Jerry Law
0,Terrible Teacher. This is a computer programming class yet we did zero programming. The class involves doing journal entries on the chapter and occasionally we have to do assignments. This doesnt seem bad but the problem is he expects you to know code for the exams which by the way are impossible. The highest grade on our midterm was a 73. ,1.0,4.0,Robert Ruder
1,I can't say enough about Professor Romani. She is awesome and caring and her class is great. I never thought that I would have FUN in a college class while learning.  I wish I could take her for all my classes and I am very lucky I am a major and will have her again.,5.0,3.0,Erin Romani

1,Almost never showed up to class & still got an A in her class. There's a huge project during the entire semester that's not hard. Quizzes are chances for you to get extra points on the test.

His class isn't hard at all just pay attention do the HWs (very few) maybe you'll get a nice take home test/quiz if you convince him that's what we did, and his tests aren't hard as all he'll tell you random ass stories through the test and class all day long.",5.0,2.0,Brian Hurley

Plus He's never said anything about me being high in class :)",5.0,2.0,MO Trout
1,"Took this class online without a lecture. Insanely easy. One hour of homework a week and then 3 open book exams, and one easy project.

1,"Best professor I ever had at NC State. I am a conservative student. Dr. Solari does not penalize students for their views. If you argue your case well and use evidence, you are given a fair grade. Many professors penalize conservative students or they are made to feel uncomfortable. This was never the case here. He keeps his views to himself.",5.0,3.0,Anthony Solari
1,"He's a really funny guy and his lectures are pretty enjoyable. There is a lot of material and he does iclicker questions in class.

That being said all his midterms were 100% multiple choice.",5.0,3.0,Garyen Chong

Her emails are unprofessional and rude.",1.0,5.0,Tonya Warden
1,"His class was pretty harsh. However, I was very luck when I was taking his class. He gave us the online exams with a lot of technology problems. So he gave us two attempts.

1,"I never took chemistry when I was in high school, but I understood it just fine. If you attend the lectures and answer questions, he makes it pretty easy to understand.

1,"His assignments are easy, but he will challenge you.  He is one of those professors who lays out arguments and presents counterarguments while very infrequently telling his own opinions.

1,"Had Lee for intro to cultural anthro and food & culture. He is very lecture heavy, but most of the notes you take in class are taken from the book.

Overall he is nice and understanding, but can be hard to understand b/c of accent.",5.0,4.0,Lee Jian

1,"Wonderful lady, has some amazing practical tips for teaching. On the downside: syllabus meant nothing, assignments were unclear until the last minute, assignments required a lot of work, but more than half your overall grade came from finals week.

1,"Besides the accent issue, he's a good prof. He teaches the concepts never worse than decently and often very well.

Lots of writing required - 3 wikis and 28 blogs. ",1.0,5.0,David Allen

Like any physical science class you have to put effort in to get the grade you want.   If you study 1-3 hours a day, you will get an A or a B depending on how well you absorb information.   Got an A by studying 1 hour a day.",5.0,3.0,Rosmarie Elizondo
1,"I love this professor and I feel that class lectures flew by. Since he lets you use a finance calculator, it made the class a lot easier and honestly more practical.

0,"Mr. Wilson was cool. Only problem that I truly had was his lack of grading throughout the course. Since the class is based on writing, you don't really know what your grade is until the end of the semester. Fortunately, I received a B in the class, but was aiming for an A. If grades matter to you, do not take him. If not, go for it. Good luck!",2.0,3.0,Michael Wilson

1,"This class wasn't too hard, only graded by homework and tests. There are no quizzes so you have to do well on the fairly difficult exams.

1,Extremely passionate about the subject matter. Turned what could be a very boring class into an interesting narrative each class. Thoughtfully executed discussions led to a comprehensible understanding of the subject matter. The discussion response are easy. The main paper is not hard if you do not procrastinate. The midterm and final are easy too.,5.0,3.0,Anna Amundson
1,this class is really easy you don't have to read any of the novels he gives you as long as your take notes in class. however his lectures are so boring you might fall asleep but overall the class is easy and the mid terms and finals are take home,2.5,2.0,Thomas Albritton
1,"Took her for civic engagement. Great class, and I'm a business major. Not too hard, but you have to listen well in class and take good notes; no need to read the book! Civic engagement is a lot of fun, you get to volunteer at a hospital or other med institution.",4.0,3.0,Victoria Wike
1,This is one of the best professors I've ever had. He always gives interesting lectures and is willing to help any student. You can easily go to him during office hours and work out any issue or question you have,4.5,3.0,Frank McLaughlin
1,He is a great teacher. You will get an A as long as you do all the assignments he assigns and his assignments are really easy as well.,4.5,1.0,William Boyer
1,"She was a really hard grader which was extremely frustrating. You have to write 8 one-paged ""microthemes"" for the class and it was almost impossible to get higher than an 8/10. She was super nice and cared about the class and knew her stuff, but also made the midterm and final really long and hard. Overall I liked her, but you have to work hard",4.0,4.0,Mary Callaway
1,Good class. Organized and easy to follow. Test are open book / open note. This doesnt mean they are easy but if you take your time the answers are pretty easy to figure out. Essays can be challenging.,5.0,4.0,Kevin Stagg
1,"Great guy, but he makes us take the quizzes before he actually teaches the material, so they are tough. 7 online quizzes 2 tests and a final. You have to read case studies and be prepared to talk about them because he will call on you and that is what participation points are based on. He starts with a joke everyday. Its hard but I recommend him!",4.0,3.0,Ryan Hunt
0,Theres daily readings for about 1/4 of the given book. Lectures were given by student instead of her. You may even be able to plagiarize as she lets it slide. Nothing is posted online so dont expect to keep track of it. Never went off the syllabus.,1.0,1.0,Nicole Pekarske
0,Prof. Regan is not clear. hard to understand. Poor at teaching. Got nothing from this class. Oh well.,2.0,4.0,James Regan
0,"Kello is a nice guy, but he is clearly way more focused on his research than on his teaching. He barely prepares his lectures and his assignments are thrown together last minute and are extremely vague, almost unintelligible. The class was obviously an afterthought for him, and he is not experienced enough to wing it.",1.5,3.0,Chris Kello
0,"Among the worst professors I've ever had. She projects blame onto students for her own lack of knowledge, ridiculously vague and contradictory requirements, and even her inability to use basic teaching technology like Carmen or MS Word. When you point out her contradictory requirements or mistakes she makes, she comes down hard on you. Rude. Awful.",1.0,5.0,Jacquelyn Meshelemiah
1,He's awesome.  Tough class but great teacher,5.0,4.0,John Shon
1,"There are in class assessment questions so you have to attend zoom lectures but Dr. reddy has amazing powerpoint that are really good for studying for exams. She writes her own exam questions and they are very specific so pay attention to what she emphasizes during lecture. One exam was unnecessarily hard but other than that, she is a solid prof.",4.0,3.0,Radhika Reddy
1,"Okay teacher. If you study hard and review your notes, you should do fine in the class. Also, book is not needed in class. You'll do fine with just your notes.",4.0,2.0,Stephen Antonetti
0,She is a tough grader and cares way too much about the assignments. She does not provide enough feedback on how to improve your grade and needs to be a little more relaxed.,2.0,4.0,Jeanette Heidewald
1,"This professor is awesome. There is really no reason not to do well on your essays. He gives you a chance to let him look them over and also have another student in class look them over. Unless you are just blowing off those chances, there is no way to really fail any of his papers. Try to pick a topic that he's excited about for your final essay.",5.0,3.0,Dylan Parkhurst
0,"She was unclear on everything that she would assign. It was confusing, the lectures were long, she accuses you of cheating with no facts to back it up, and she will not reply to your e-mail's. I would not recommend this ""teacher"" to anyone. She is rude and inconsiderate to her students. The worst experience in a semester.",1.5,5.0,Sandy Bolt
1,"Dr. Smith is a great professor. You can tell he really cares about his students and wants to see them succeed. When I had questions, even if they weren't related to class, he went out of his way to help me. Also, his lectures were interesting and he gave useful feedback on assignments. I would recommend taking his classes.",5.0,4.0,David Smith
0,Sure she knows her stuff on political analysis but she is a horrible professor. Pop quizzes on the days most kids are absent(like the day b4 thanksgiving) and 7 memos total in the class. She couldn't care less about her students and literally makes sure they do bad. The class is extremely boring and she makes sure we go overtime every class.,1.5,5.0,Tana Johnson
1,"I loved this class.  While some topics are boring, others got the class going.  Great teacher and I will recommend anyone taking his PHI class.  All in all, my favorite class yet.  He cares about your opinion.  If you back it up with decent evidence in why you chose to go that way you will get a good grade. Also, do the presentation.  Its will help.",5.0,2.0,Leonard Winogora
1,The best!,5.0,1.0,Stephen Cuono
1,"Mr. Kanetis was my favorite teacher I've taken at Moraine. As long as you study and participate in class you should be fine. If you're the type to skip class however, I would look for a different professor if you're looking to get an A. Quizzes every Monday and participation points on the days there's not to lose. Made class fun and was awesome!",5.0,3.0,Peter Kanetis
1,Fun class! You will need a clicker for this class. Tests and homework are very easy. Professor Harris is a very easygoing person and you can go to him for anything. He also gives out extra credit toward the end of the semester so go to class!,5.0,3.0,Lee Harris
1,"Great teacher, gave many chances for extra credit opportunities. Tests were relatively easy, all based off of the study guide. Gave many points at the end of the semester, especially if you showed up to class.",5.0,3.0,Huiying Chen
1,"I loved this class! I learned alot about the real world and the law. What he says is true, its experience talking. I'll tell you a secret. Mention food in class and he may proably dismiss early (depends if hes hungry enough).",5.0,1.0,Richard Dale Oriol
1,This guy is the best! If you're looking for an easy philosophy class this is it. It doesn't get much better than this. He has 3 exams and no homework (except the reading which is not required but if you want to get good grades on the test is highly recommended) He gives great examples in class and is available for helping after.,5.0,1.0,James Stockton
1,"Dr. Krueger is very easy going, likes participation and discussions.  She likes group activities and grades fairly.  4 assessments, 4 learning activities (mostly in class), 1 group application presentation as a final.  Didn't really use the book.  Lectures from PPT and tests from those slides and your notes on her lectures.",4.0,2.0,Dianna Krueger
1,"Dr Anderson is one of the smartest professors at VSU, he gets to know all of his students and goes out his way to make sure you pass. After taking this class you begin to feel like a scientist. but, He uses stack grading on a point scale. always attend lectures, its impossible to learn the information on your own. Study ASAP before exams. go to lab",5.0,5.0,Corey Anderson
1,We used the course reader every week to focus on sentence structures and you go over them in class. The sentence structures that you learned that week must be in the essay that is due. I believe we had like 5 essays for the semester and they were all six pages long. He gives you a week or so to do them and people peer review them before you turn in,4.0,3.0,Richard Sammons
1,"shes so nice, loves to talk, and is awesome! she isnt very clear on assignments sometimes though.  but shes ALWAYs there to be helpfull. i didnt go to class that much, all you had to do was show up for 15 minutes, and take a quiz, but if you missed class that week, you could make it up the next class. you have to write 4 papers.. thats all !!",3.5,1.0,Galina Sundberg
1,I took him for Soc 001 online and it was an easy A. Just do the reading. You can rent the book on Amazon for less than $20. No group projects or homework. He assigns you chapters to read then you take an exam based on those chapters. Questions are straight forward and some of the questions you can Google and get the answer easily.,4.0,2.0,Jose Lopez
1,"Great class, was very enthusiastic about topic she taught which was Harlem Renaissance. Only two tests which was open notes etc.. One writing project with presentation. Very interesting class. Would go off on tangents semi related to then we were discuss in class on days then get back on topic but it was a great class learned a lot.",4.0,2.0,Ebony Gibson
0,"No, this professor is not funny, he's cringey. Quiz topics are to vague to predict for any of his classes, and will not provide you with any review whatsoever. You just have to flatter him to get a decent grade. Don't believe the positive reviews they're very misleading and understate his very apparent flaws as a professor, probably the him tbh...",1.0,4.0,Patrick Rosenkjar
1,"She is my favorite professor. She is extremely understanding and caring. Just pay attention in class, participate, and take good note and it will be an easy A! I really wish I could take another class with her.",5.0,2.0,Eva Delius
1,Its a difficult class no matter who you take it with. But Don is fantastic and really engaging,5.0,3.0,Donald Haidey
1,"Professor Miller is great! He is always willing to help clarify things if you don't understand something. Expect to be quizzed every day you meet, but it's not hard. As long as you study and read the material he provides you can pass with an A.   Take his class! :D",5.0,2.0,Jonathan Miller
1,"his lectures are funny, interesting, and sometimes very moving.  i was not looking forward to this class and i loved it.  considering his quizzes are simple translations and papers get proofread by other students AS WELL AS the prof. and TA you have to be an idiot to do badly.",4.5,4.0,Larry Scanlon
1,"She has favorites, and most of the time they are girls, and it well be extremely clear when you're the only person to have your hand up and get completely ignored. Not sure how you can get on her ""badside"", but if are you're going to notice the difference in grading.",3.5,4.0,Laura Paglis
1,"Great professor! His lectures are super interesting. He explains the material well, and is super open to helping you and offering support. The textbook is a very hard read.",4.5,4.0,Stuart Brown
1,"Ryan is awesome! took him for Portfolio 1 & 2. He is helpful in class, but because of short class times,  take advantage of his office hours. He is always willing to listen and help you work through your creative issues to create something truly great.  He is a tough grader -  he expects a lot of out of his students to prepare them for ad life.",4.0,4.0,Ryan Romero
0,"The content she teaches is interesting, but she has ideas about intersectionality and all the problems with that way of thinking (if you know what I mean). Go into her class with skepticism and do not allow yourself to be swayed. People are individuals, not their cultural identity. Just because she is a professor doesn't mean she absolute.",2.0,3.0,Summer Harlow
0,Way too much work and reading for a 200 level class. He expects his students to do way more work than should be expected for a class at this level. He is very opinionated & seems to make personal vendettas against students who voice opposing thoughts. Anyone who thinks for themselves rather than just saying what the professor wants should stay away,2.0,4.0,Kirby Brown
1,"I am currently taking his class, and I LOVE it. I definitely recommend his class.",5.0,1.0,Mark Johnson
1,Great teacher.,5.0,3.0,Wayne Christensen
1,"The class is very easy, do the work, study and you will get a good grade. Hands out study guides, take home quizzes. All you need to know are in the unit handouts. Fun class, would recommend this teacher and take another course from him again",4.5,2.0,J.R. Jones
1,"Abdulkarim was first my tutor and then he became my professor in Elementary Arabic I. He is a great professor. He uses wonderful powerpoints, and he is always well-prepared.",4.5,2.0,Abdulkarim Sekta
1,"He was great with in-class discussions of texts and it really helped unpack a work. Being in class was a good time, we led the discussions. My problem was he was very vague with paper requirements and feedback, so it was hard to improve your next paper. He's great if you want to talk literature, not great if you need specifics about your paper.",3.0,4.0,Mike McLane
1,"Funny, understanding and a very motivating instructor. I  am taking a second class with him this Semester!",5.0,2.0,Leon Corder
0,"Throughout my 4 years at SJSU, this class with Professor Pearce wins the award for teaching me the most amount of useless crap. SWE majors, there are much better technical electives you can take that will actually help you land a job in the real world- unlike the useless crap taught here.",1.0,5.0,Jon Pearce
1,"This class is so so easy if you are a logical person (I am a mechanical engineering major and I never had to study for this class), but if you struggle with logic then this class will be a big effort, so many people dropped.. either you are really good or really bad at this class I guess",5.0,2.0,Douglas Ehring
0,Diane is extremely nice but I would not recommend her if you're looking for a professor who will help you out. Tests are basically all she relies on for grades and she doesn't give any extra credit out. She talks about her kids a lot so she gets side tracked and then starts rushing through sections.,2.0,3.0,Diane Stralka
1,"If you don't show up to class, you won't do well on the exams or quizes. Will reexplain previous lecture next day before starting a new lecture. Homeworks are actually quizes & answers can be found in the book or lecture notes. She mixes her lectures on power point and whiteboard. 1 writing assignment based on case studies.",5.0,2.0,Qin Fan

1,"Dr. Zhao is so nice! He is very good at explaining difficult concepts and doesn't assume you remember concepts from classes you probably took years ago. He is very nice outside of class and offers extra credit! His lectures are usually at 8am, but you get used to it through the semester, and he gives random extra credit for showing up.",5.0,3.0,Linlin Zhao
1,"I don't know WHAT some of these people are talking about.  First of all, if you are not willing to talk and argue with ""femanist liberals,"" then what exactly makes you want to do English? I have found that all POV's are considered with good supportive evidence.  If she seems cold, try to show her how interested u r in the class, u may be surprised!",5.0,3.0,Malin Pereira
1,"Dr. Sharp is really nice and a good professor, but sometimes unclear about her expectations. Unlike my peers, I enjoy the Theories textbook she chose (but I'm used to very dense theory books from many undergrad theory courses). She is fair and helpful if you experience an issue and talk to her about it.",4.0,1.0,Jennifer Sharp
1,"Rizzella  has an upbeat and energetic teaching style. She uses different approaches in teaching statistics and even makes the material interesting. She is supportive, available, down-to-earth. She made me want to be a psycholgoy major.",5.0,4.0,Michelle Rizzella
0,"Im surprised I don't see comments about how inappropriate and problematic this professor is. He talks in circles and his lectures become redundant after week two. He uses awful examples in class to explain his points. Most of his examples are centered around race, politics or class. He also likes to talk about sex, how did we get here again? AVOID.",1.0,1.0,Sam Gilmore
1,"Professor Haney is a great teacher.  He challenges the students to think, uses cold calling effectively, and is crystal clear in his lectures.  His syllabus doesn't overwhelm you with reading.  Most importantly, he scheduled lunch with almost everyone in a 70-80 student class in small groups.  Very kind.",5.0,4.0,Thomas Haney
0,Liked him as a person but is horrible as a professor. He should stick to what he is good at- writing. He plays favorites and I never had him as a professor prior to Sales. However in my one and only semester with him I found all the rumors to be true...worst semester ever. IF there is ANYONE else teaching Sales - Getaway from Gerber!!,1.0,4.0,Scott Gerber
0,"He's kind of funny, but most people just seem annoyed with his humor. He calls us ""people"" all the time, and makes weird noises when he speaks. Some days I would get lost in counting the time he said ""people, if you dont' know this by now, then..."" and I would completely miss out on the material. Really knows his stuff though",2.5,3.0,Edward Chaloupka
1,she was great you never had to guess what material you would be tested over and there was enough extra credit built in to the tests to raise you a letter grade,5.0,1.0,Barbara Lusk
1,"Prof. Peters is tough. Yes, it is a one day a week class, but seriously, you could be DYING and she won't let you make up the weekly quizzes. She assigns way too much reading & expects you to understand & remember almost EVERYTHING for the in class discussions. She's a hard grader & when she does leave comments THEY ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO READ. no fun:(",3.0,4.0,Meryl Peters
1,"Great professor. If you study ahead of time (like you really should in college), you'll do fine. If you put off homework until the last second and then start cramming, you'll be lucky to pass. Although he doesn't go by the textbook, following along in the textbook is highly encouraged. Make sure you do the practice problems from the book!!",4.0,5.0,Pavel Dubovskiy
0,".Not a lot of feedback, she doesn't like to get emails by students. It is really hard to get good grade own this class. However, I have learned a lot of things fro her! She is organized and clear how to teach. DEFINITELY, HARD GRADER!! DONT TAKE HER CLASS IF YOU WANT TO PASS EASILY!",2.0,5.0,Miriam Keller-Perkins
1,I have taken many classes with him and he I's also my advisor. He does have strong views that don't sit well with some he is a very open minded and caring person and professor. You will have lots of reading to do but it Is more focused on case studies than boring text book definitions.,4.5,3.0,Frank McLaughlin
0,"Do not take her, take another professor f possible. she does not even teach correctly, it is more of a self learning class",1.0,5.0,Keikilani Williams
1,"She speaks pretty fast!!! BUT gives great examples, allowing you to make an image of how the parts of business works. Youll have an online chapter quiz due on the weekend that is based on the book. Dont study too hard for her tests, its simple but make sure you understand the concepts and how its applied in situations. Shes VERY approachable.",4.0,3.0,Wendy Shan
1,SSSSSuper good professor. Makes BA210 so easy to learn.,5.0,1.0,Bert Zarb
1,The school only offers letter grades. There is no + or - grade. Reviews with these probably haven't taken one of her classes. Dr. Massnick is the most caring and intelligent teacher at the school. She teaches in an unconventional style that incorporates real-life over textbook examples. You get out of what you invest in. She's one of a kind.,5.0,3.0,Kimberlie Massnick
1,It wasn't too bad. The class was very similar to my high school chemistry class but taught a little faster and a little more in depth. The accent wasn't too bad to get used to.,3.5,2.0,Cornelia Mihai
1,"Excellent Professor! He is patient and friendly. I had his class today.

Those of you who give bad comment, I disagree with your opinion.",5.0,2.0,Moazzam Hossain
1,"Survey of British Literature 2 Interesting, especially for a survey type course.

Three essays and a lot of quizzes. Could also memorize poems for extra credit--cool!",5.0,3.0,Robert Waxler
0,"You have to teach yourself and do homework before class THEN he'll go over the homework and kind of lectureteach.

I'm heading to another campus.  ",1.5,4.0,Paul Skelly
1,Mr Molnar was by far my favorite teacher. He makes you work for your grade but doesn't make papers too hard that you're pulling your hair out. He follows the syllabus he makes almost to a T. Participation is a must for a grade but he's very easy to interact with and gives good feedback. Nothing is ever wrong. Moral booster and great teacher!,5.0,4.0,Eric Molnar
1,"BEST TEACHER EVER! Take her she is amazing. She is knowledgeable, passionate, and cares about her students. Lectures were always spot on and pertained to the tests.

Look up those reviews she's outstanding.",5.0,1.0,Catherine Gangarossa
1,"By far the best professor! Very laid back, cracks jokes and is very informative. Two open book exams, an extremely short paper, and one debate. Other than that you just sit back and enjoy the class. I wish he taught all the business courses.",4.0,2.0,Brian McNamara
1,"I had her in 50 minute classes, and I clocked her in and 163 ""uhm"" and ""uh""s one day. It makes class almost annoying to sit through. The information was rather dry, but maybe that was just the way Terry taught.",4.0,3.0,Terry Miller-Herringer

1,Really great prof. Any problem I had with the class was because of my classmates. He did his best to accommodate the changes from in-person to online. He really put effort into his lectures and explained on-topic questions well. I'm taking COSC 121 with him next term.,5.0,3.0,Abdallah Mohamed
1,"Prof Hetrick was the best ENG100 teacher I could ask for. Entire class was graded on just 4 essays, an easy multiple choice final and class participation.

Classes can feel like they go on for a bit, class times are a bit lecture heavy, but he makes it interesting.",5.0,3.0,Kyle Hetrick
1,"Professor Razon was great and provided a very simple class which was appreciated due to the pandemic. His assignments and quizzes are straight forward. The only thing I didn't like was his mandatory monthly zoom sessions (if you missed more than 3, you had to do an alternative assignment) which defeats the purpose of a fully online class.",5.0,1.0,Albert Razon

1,"Terri is very nice and is always willing to help her students succeed. She is very personable and extends a hand whenever you need help. Her class was manageable.

In labs, you have stations and it can be difficult to get your work done so plan your time properly.",4.5,3.0,Terri Core

1,"He is a good teacher and instructor. Engaging , very enjoyable to listen to. The only  reservation that I have is that there is some indications in his teaching about his political views that he subtly includes in his class.

1,"had him as a visiting professor at Purchase and his class was easy! there was no hw and you could get by without reading the required textbook. all we had was 4 quizzes, a midterm (you were allowed 1 page of notes) and a final. lots of opportunities for extra credit. he's ideal to teach classes to non-majors/gen eds",4.5,1.0,Gene Fein
1,"Jim was an awesome instructor. The class was not easy, but he made me dig down deep, define my mission, and really give some serious thought into my management experience. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Most importantly, my relationship with Jim continues to this day, and I am not alone.  If he is listed-make sure you sign up for his section.",5.0,4.0,James McHann
1,Kirby Brown is the best English professor I've ever had. He really makes you care about what you're reading about and why you're reading it.

1,"She is brand new but she is pretty great.  Professor Peters is honest and tells it like it is, and she also makes you completely aware of what she wants on assignments.

She can spot 1.5 inch margins a mile away!",4.0,3.0,Callandra Peters
1,"Angie is a phenomenal instructor.  She is authentic, highly knowledgable, and approachable.  She is more than willing to provide help in the clinical setting.

0,"Like others have mentioned, the material itself is easy, but she made it really hard by giving a ridiculous amount of homework, with mandatory attendence of lectures, tutorials, and weekly quizzes.

1,"Took her for stats (hybrid) and trig (online). Both were super easy. For stats, tests and quizzes were open notes. For trig, you could take the quizzes twice and keep the higher score.

He was usually a pretty nice and engaging guy but some days he would just be in a bad mood.",4.0,3.0,Jeremy Luallen
0,I barely went to class... just for the review and tests. Going to class will just confuse you because all she does is drag on topics and uses big words for no reason. Her power points are literally just words without explanations. The only reason I got a B- was because I never went to class and just read out of the book.,2.5,2.0,Cindy White
1,"He is very good with AutoCAD, the only problem is that TEC 116 is a class for beginners in AutoCAD and he teaches as is we have all had the same 20 years of experience as him.

This was ironic because he said no answers were wrong. Everyone else who participated received praise or a positive response.",4.0,2.0,Leonard Winogora
1,"Although Dr. Gonzalez's class was kind of boring, his class easy. In order to pass this class, you need to write in MLA format, check your grammar and sentence structure.

0,"I don't recommend this teacher, she seems to treat students like if its high school, for a college course students need to think critically in order to make assignments, but she uses high school techniques such as memorizing things for the exams which is pretty high school, my advise: avoid this teacher too much homework and no points for it.",2.0,5.0,Maria Montero

I had to teach myself all the material and spent hours learning it at home",1.0,4.0,Eran Makover
1,"Not the most interesting lectures. Just try to pay attention to lecture, skim through the assigned readings and you should be fine.

ECC needs more Professors like him, period!",5.0,3.0,Abderrahim Mazzouri
1,"I took this class (Law, Politics, & Justice) in Russell's first semester teaching it, so it wasn't very organized yet--but  it was super fun and low-stress.

After exam 1 and 3 HW I was discouraged to work hard",2.0,5.0,Jon Pearce
1,Dr. McLaughlin is a nice guy but the critical thinking class is useless in my opinion. He assigns 8 homework assignments that are worth next to nothing point wise. He expects you to participate in class daily & deducts points if you dont. The midterm was decent but the final was ridiculously stupid and worth 35 points of your grade. Never had a C!,3.0,5.0,Peter McLaughlin

1,I loved Dr. Smith for ED280! Her lectures were mainly relating to the book with her own connections in them. She is very homework heavy so plan accordingly.

If you're  in for the challenge go on ahead, but besides that I would suggest you to find another teacher. In order to get some points at the end you have to speak up and answer questions.",1.0,4.0,Jay Schwartz

Tests and quizzes are easy.",5.0,2.0,Victoria Ryburn

1,"Prof. Potvin is a nice guy but I feel like Physics with modeling is more suited for people who have taken some kind of physics before and have a core understanding of it. Like others have said there is very little that gets taught, instead you are supposed to work in groups and figure out the information with only a few LA/TA to help you as needed.",3.0,4.0,Geoff Potvin
1,I took this class over winter intercession. Thomas Kamau is one of the nicest teachers I have ever had. The book was not required during intercession and we met for about 4-5 days for 5 hours at a time but it went by so quick. He is also very funny and tells funny stories! Would def. recommend him for anyone doing health administration!,5.0,1.0,Thomas Kamau

1,"Good teacher. Easy class with an extremely light workload. 2 tests and a final. Final is the most difficult but 50 multiple choice questions and a notecard. Never went the full class time, if you do your work on time and use a flash card on the tests you will get an A.",4.0,2.0,Paula Hegner
0,"I would highly recommend not taking this class unless you have too. She is honestly one of the worst teachers I have ever had.

She's also rude. don't take it.",1.0,4.0,Dorothy Rombo
1,"This woman SUCKS!!! All she does is talk about her kids and let other illegitimate classmates distract her from the course.

Overall hes a great professor!",5.0,4.0,Roger Solano
1,"Mrs. B is very funny and sarcastic.  At times she's very blunt and won't hold back, but as long as you're asking useful questions and not making her repeat herself she's very nice and helpful.

Good luck, have fun and godspeed.",1.0,4.0,Natalia Shkiler

0,"I'll start off by syaing that she is a very nice person, but a terrible teacher. She does know Social Work, but is very very unorganized. She also takes forever to get around to grading. The class is easy but she seems to not really have a game plan going into it.",1.5,2.0,Bertha Kondrak
1,"This is by far one of my favorite professors at the U of A. Just go to class and you'll be good.

0,Not a fan of this professor. He is inexperienced and therefore doesn't teach the material clearly. He constantly makes mistakes and confuses himself and the class. Doesn't really adequately prepare the class for the homework or tests either. I also asked for help with part of the project and he was rude and unhelpful with his response.    ,2.5,4.0,Taek-yul Kim

1,"Mr. Lee is a great professor. I honestly do not know why he has such a low evaluation in here. I took Accounting and Business Computer Applications with him and the classes were pretty easy.

1,Shes a solid choice when it comes to a professor but beware she docs points for every little thing.

0,Possibly the worst class.  She has the most strict attendance policy so that you can sit in class and have her read you the book.  I have other ways of WASTING an hour and 15 min.  I highly recommend looking elsewhere for a mktg prof.  Take Turner instead,1.0,2.0,Rhonda Mack

1,"The class is easy, but the professor is kind of crappy. She will assign homework on a Sunday night at 11pm and want it done for your 9am class. But then she doesn't take off points for late homework? She curves the quizzes & tests a lot which helps. She only speak in french and always corrects your pronunciation. She randomly calls on you in class.",3.0,3.0,Margaret Caprara
1,His lectures are pretty good and he explains concepts well. Homeworks and exam questions can be tough and thought-provoking at times.

Overall, a good instructor.",3.0,3.0,Marvin McEntie

Passed the CLEP exam at the community college next day.",1.0,5.0,Phil Bartlett

1,Professor Schuster is a great professor has lectures that are well formulated and is easy to understand. He does have a research paper but if you keep up with it you'll do fine. He uses YouTube clips to engage and shows material that pertains to lecture topics.,5.0,3.0,David Schuster
1,"Mr. FM is seriously one of the best profs I had. He's super funny and really loves to teach, which makes him give great feedback and willing to help with anything! He's pretty carefree as well so the class environment is laid back and fun. I'd totally take every writing class with him if I could.",5.0,3.0,Will Forde-Mazrui
1,"Great teacher. I recommend you take her if you don't take politics too seriously. Unfortunately for me, she was a little to obviously leftward leaning in her personal bias. Preference isn't usually an issue as many are liberal at BBC, but the class was critical thinking and she did little to incite any critical thinking to a mostly lib class.",4.0,3.0,Grace Ebron
1,This was the best class I have ever taken. Paul Coutinho was fantastic. He truly cared about all of his students and wanted them to find joy in life. I learned so much. This is the type of class that makes you look at everything differently. I wish everyone could take Coutinho's class!,5.0,3.0,Paul Coutinho
1,"I have never been good at math and I was able to get an A in an online math class! It wasn't easy and I had to spend a lot of time studying, but if it wasn't for his lecture videos and the way he teaches I never would've been that successful. He is also great at answering questions and always responds to emails quickly. He wants you to succeed.",5.0,4.0,Stephen Selph
1,"LOVE Professor Spearman!! Decent amount of reading, but I've definitely had worse. Lectures are super interesting and entertaining. Pay attention in class and take notes and you'll be fine on the exam. 10 page paper was kind of difficult, but the weekly responses and quiz boosts your grade up since they're pretty easy. Would definitely reccommend!!",5.0,3.0,Amy Spearman
0,"As other said, and at this time I have to add, even in an online class, be ready for this teacher to go off topic, very unorganized, shares too much of her private life. I will say if the class were face to face she would have been talking about her life all day long. No offense but may be it is time to stay home and enjoy your family.",2.5,3.0,Patricia Lafferty
1,"Best microeconomics teacher ever. His class was an easy A. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you show up and take notes you'll pass, plus will give extra credit questions. Extremely funny and only gives 4 homework assignments and 4 exams. His 4th exam is his final and its not accumulative. Definitely take his class if you want to pass. ",5.0,1.0,Peter Daley
1,"The best professor I have had at City College. Yes, a lot of work, but if you dive in and do the reading and assignments you really learn a lot. She is easy to engage with and learn from, and this course (and her others, I've taken a few) is worth while. I always feel satisfied when I finish the readings or an assignment.",5.0,4.0,Susanna Schaller
1,I've taken his Math60 class before the reason why I didn't hesitate to take his Math 90 this summer. His grading is clear through web-assign you're able to monitor your grades based on your work. The forum on canvas helps you to have a better understanding which Mr. bertens are very helpful to help you solve a problem. No regret taking his class.,5.0,3.0,Matt Bertens

0,Meh,2.0,4.0,Jianling Yue
1,"He cares a lot about students performance, he is very fair and tries his best to benefit students. I took Chem 3021 in winter 2014 and he made me like mechanisms. I was doing bad at the beginning but boost my grade to B+ in the final. I might take 4021 with him but I am scared of stereochemistry. I see him sometimes now I am taking summer school.",4.5,2.0,Arturo Orellana
1,"She is careful to give each student adequate attention and practice to ensure topics are truly learned. Attendance depends on course pacing. My class met once a week for 3 hours, so it was more mandatory so I wouldn't miss things. Overall, she is a kind teacher that will do what she can to ensure you understand the lesson.",4.0,2.0,Nora Leiva
1,"This class is an easy A if you actually go to class. 20% of your grade is showing up to the lectures and if you pay attention, and have a decent understanding of basic history you will do fine. On my specific final, he gave us a picture that wasn't even on his study guide, so make sure you study everything for the exams.",5.0,2.0,Ibrahim Al-Marashi
0,Not a very nice person and very opinionated. He is supposed to be a deacon but he seems pretty politically weird to me. Take any other religion teacher instead.,1.0,5.0,Randall Woodard
0,"She's lenient with grading the lab's but when it comes to quizzes they are just horrible! She would give you a random species that you have no information on a few days before the quiz and then expect you to become an expert on it in a few days! Her lectures are just horrid, she usually joins and talks about how hard her second job is mostly.",1.0,4.0,Edythe Sonntag
1,"Very helpful, extremly knowledgeable of history, a teacher whom is passionate about her students and the work she is doing.  Honor to be in her class.",5.0,2.0,Sherylle Smith
1,I have never been so stressed taking a writing course before and the fact that she grades every single little thing as hard as she can made me cry myself to sleep on many occasions please pick another prof if you are taking this class for credit. Save your mental health im not kidding if you're reading this listen to me pls and thx. HARD GRADER!,3.0,5.0,Jocelyn McCarthy
1,I enjoyed this class a lot and she had a lot of understanding for disabilities studies. I would suggest taking her.,4.5,1.0,Katherine Mahosky
1,"Such an easy class all quiz's are online, and projects are super easy. SAM assignments can be a little tricky but she's super helpful if you need it. Her due dates are constantly changing, but it's usually to ur benefit. BTW don't buy the book! you'll never use it.. All you need is the SAM code which u can buy for 60 amazon. Dnt spend the 200!",5.0,1.0,Diane Coyle
1,The best professor I have come across in college by far. Super understanding and helpful. Patient and Fair. Super funny and makes the lectures fun and interesting. Helped me understand science and like it again.,5.0,4.0,Shaine Henry
1,"As a professor, she is one of the best I have ever had. Not only does she truly care for the students and what they are able to take away from her class, but she does see the effort that the students put into her class. She tries to help clean up students' pronunciation whenever possible, so that the students speak as authentic Chinese as they can.",5.0,4.0,Jianling Yue
1,"I LOVED Raquel!!!! She is definitely my favorite professor at LSU! She is so smart and knowledgable about a lot!! Her quizzes were pretty hard. There are two exams, a midterm and final, but she believes in group exams so you get to take them with someone. I failed almost every quiz but ended up with an A. Speeches are not bad at all!!",5.0,2.0,Raquel Polanco
1,Great stories and pretty entertaining. Class is fairly easy and you don't have a book so everything is straight from notes and lectures. He loves talking about study abroad programs and has been to what seems like every country. When he talks about a region he usually has pictures of himself in these locations so it keeps you interested for sure.,4.5,3.0,Wade Watkins
